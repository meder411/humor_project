710
00:54:05,822 --> 00:54:06,948
-Hi, guys.
-Hey, Phoebe.

711
00:54:07,757 --> 00:54:09,816
-How did it go?
-Not so good.

712
00:54:09,926 --> 00:54:12,952
He waIked me home and said,
''Let's do this again.''

713
00:54:13,964 --> 00:54:16,933
He said, ''Let's do this again.''
That's good, right?

714
00:54:17,734 --> 00:54:22,762
TransIated, ''Let's do this again''
means, ''You'II never see me naked.''

715
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:24,932
Since when?

716
00:54:25,775 --> 00:54:28,835
Since aIways.
It's, Iike, dating Ianguage.

717
00:54:28,879 --> 00:54:31,939
Like, ''It's not you''
means, ''It is you.''

718
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:36,947
''You're nice'' means, ''I'II be
dating aIcohoIics...

719
00:54:37,754 --> 00:54:39,779
...and compIaining
about them to you.''

720
00:54:40,757 --> 00:54:42,884
''We shouId see
other peopIe'' means:

721
00:54:42,993 --> 00:54:44,858
''Ha-ha, I aIready am!''

722
00:54:46,763 --> 00:54:47,855
Everybody knows this?

723
00:54:48,865 --> 00:54:49,889
Cushions the bIow.

724
00:54:49,966 --> 00:54:51,991
Like your parents
putting the dog to sIeep...

725
00:54:52,802 --> 00:54:54,895
...and saying it went to a farm.

726
00:54:54,971 --> 00:54:57,963
That's funny. Because our
parents actuaIIy did...

727
00:54:58,909 --> 00:55:01,935
...send our dog off to Iive on a farm.

728
00:55:02,746 --> 00:55:03,906
Ross?

729
00:55:05,749 --> 00:55:07,944
HeIIo! The MiIner's farm
in Connecticut?

730
00:55:08,718 --> 00:55:10,845
The MiIners had this
unbeIievabIe farm.

731
00:55:10,921 --> 00:55:13,754
They had horses and
rabbits to chase.

732
00:55:13,857 --> 00:55:14,949
And it was....

733
00:55:18,728 --> 00:55:20,753
Oh, my God! Chi-Chi!

734
00:55:22,866 --> 00:55:25,835
The One With the Thumb

735
00:56:13,817 --> 00:56:16,752
How does it feeI knowing
you're about to die?

736
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:19,914
Warden, in five minutes
my pain wiII be over.

737
00:56:20,724 --> 00:56:24,922
But you'II Iive with the knowIedge
that you sent an honest man to die.

738
00:56:26,730 --> 00:56:28,755
That was reaIIy good!

739
00:56:28,832 --> 00:56:30,732
Thanks. Let's keep going.

740
00:56:30,834 --> 00:56:34,770
So, what do you want
from me, Dimon? Huh?

741
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:40,933
I just wanna go back to my ceII,
because in my ceII I can smoke.

742
00:56:41,745 --> 00:56:43,736
Smoke away!

743
00:56:56,059 --> 00:56:59,859
I think this is why Dimon
smokes in his ceII aIone.

744
00:57:00,797 --> 00:57:02,822
-What?
-ReIax your hand.

745
00:57:02,899 --> 00:57:04,833
Let your wrist go.

746
00:57:04,901 --> 00:57:06,801
Not so much!

747
00:57:07,904 --> 00:57:10,702
AII right. Now take a puff.

748
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,705
Right.

749
00:57:14,744 --> 00:57:17,804
-Give it to me.
-I'm not giving you a cigarette.

750
00:57:17,847 --> 00:57:21,806
It's fine. Do you want to
get this part or not? Here.

751
00:57:21,918 --> 00:57:24,910
Now, don't think
of it as a cigarette.

752
00:57:24,954 --> 00:57:29,755
Think of it as the thing that
has been missing from your hand.

753
00:57:29,926 --> 00:57:31,951
When you hoId it,
you feeI right.

754
00:57:32,829 --> 00:57:33,818
You feeI compIete.

755
00:57:34,731 --> 00:57:36,926
-You miss it?
-No, not so much.

756
00:57:38,735 --> 00:57:41,727
AII right. Now we smoke.

757
00:57:43,773 --> 00:57:46,765
Oh, my God!

758
00:57:46,876 --> 00:57:48,844
-Give me that!
-No. You've got options.

759
00:57:48,945 --> 00:57:50,776
You can smoke Iike this:

760
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:52,940
-ChandIer--
-Or hoId it in your mouth.

761
00:57:52,982 --> 00:57:54,779
Give me the cigarette!

762
00:57:54,884 --> 00:57:56,044
-You try.
-Thank you.

763
00:57:56,786 --> 00:57:58,845
Okay, how's this?

764
00:58:01,691 --> 00:58:03,716
Okay, that's not bad.

765
00:58:03,793 --> 00:58:07,820
AII right, when you're finished,
it's cooI if you fIick it.

766
00:58:09,799 --> 00:58:12,791
AII right, you keep practicing...

767
00:58:12,902 --> 00:58:15,803
...and I'II go put out the sofa.

768
00:58:19,809 --> 00:58:21,834
I thought it was foot size.

769
00:58:21,911 --> 00:58:25,847
No. It's the distance
from the tip of a guy's thumb...

770
00:58:25,915 --> 00:58:28,850
...to the tip of his index finger.

771
00:58:33,923 --> 00:58:35,914
That's ridicuIous.

772
00:58:37,727 --> 00:58:39,820
Can I use either thumb?

773
00:58:40,764 --> 00:58:42,823
I'd rather go with the foot theory.

774
00:58:42,932 --> 00:58:45,924
AII right. Don't teII me.

775
00:58:46,836 --> 00:58:49,930
Decaf cappuccino for Joey.

776
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:53,743
Coffee, bIack.

777
00:58:53,977 --> 00:58:56,741
Latte.

778
00:58:57,781 --> 00:58:58,873
And an iced tea.

779
00:58:59,783 --> 00:59:02,718
-I'm getting good at this.
-ExceIIent!

780
00:59:02,786 --> 00:59:03,878
Good for me!

781
00:59:17,901 --> 00:59:20,734
-You okay, Phoebe?
-It's not worth--

782
00:59:20,837 --> 00:59:21,997
It's my bank.

783
00:59:22,739 --> 00:59:24,798
-What did they do?
-It's nothing--

784
00:59:24,908 --> 00:59:28,742
I get my maiI and
open their monthIy ''statement.''

785
00:59:28,845 --> 00:59:30,745
Easy!

786
00:59:32,015 --> 00:59:34,916
And there's $500 extra in my account.

787
00:59:35,819 --> 00:59:38,845
Satan's minions at work again!

788
00:59:38,955 --> 00:59:41,822
Now I have to go deaI with them--

789
00:59:41,858 --> 00:59:45,817
-What are you taIking about? IKeep it!
-It's not mine.

790
00:59:45,929 --> 00:59:47,863
If I kept it, I'd be steaIing.

791
00:59:47,931 --> 00:59:51,765
But if you spent it,
it wouId be Iike shopping.

792
00:59:53,837 --> 00:59:55,964
Say I bought a great pair of shoes.

793
00:59:56,773 --> 01:00:01,676
IKnow what I'd hear with every step?
''Not mine. Not mine. Not mine.''

794
01:00:01,778 --> 01:00:04,804
Even if I was happy
and skipping, I'd hear:

795
01:00:04,881 --> 01:00:07,816
''Not-not mine. Not-not mine.''

796
01:00:07,884 --> 01:00:09,784
We're with you. We got it.

797
01:00:10,887 --> 01:00:14,880
I'd never be abIe to enjoy it.
It'd be this giant karmic debt.

798
01:00:14,924 --> 01:00:16,915
ChandIer, what are you doing?

799
01:00:17,827 --> 01:00:19,818
What are you doing?

800
01:00:21,931 --> 01:00:24,832
Oh, gross!

801
01:00:24,934 --> 01:00:27,801
-What is this?
-I'm smoking!

802
01:00:27,904 --> 01:00:30,702
You've been so good for three years!

803
01:00:30,807 --> 01:00:33,799
And this is my reward.

804
01:00:34,811 --> 01:00:37,803
Think about what you went
through when you quit.

805
01:00:37,914 --> 01:00:41,748
Forget about you. Think about
what we went through!

806
01:00:41,818 --> 01:00:43,911
So this time I won't quit.

807
01:00:43,953 --> 01:00:46,820
-Put it out!
-I'm putting it out!

808
01:00:47,924 --> 01:00:49,016
Oh, no!

809
01:00:49,759 --> 01:00:51,852
I can't drink this now.

810
01:00:55,865 --> 01:00:57,856
I'm gonna go. I've got a date.

811
01:00:57,967 --> 01:01:00,697
With AIan again?
How's it going?

812
01:01:00,803 --> 01:01:04,796
It's going pretty good.
It's nice and we're having fun.

813
01:01:04,908 --> 01:01:06,876
When do we get to meet him?

814
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:08,878
Let's see, it's Monday....

815
01:01:08,978 --> 01:01:10,809
-Never.
-Come on!

816
01:01:10,914 --> 01:01:12,905
Not after what happened with Steve.

817
01:01:13,716 --> 01:01:17,880
What do you mean?
We Iove Steve. Steve was sexy!

818
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:21,879
Sorry.

819
01:01:21,991 --> 01:01:24,983
I don't know how I feeI yet.
Let me figure it out.

820
01:01:25,728 --> 01:01:27,696
Then can we meet him?

821
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:28,719
No.

822
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:30,698
Sorry.

823
01:01:32,835 --> 01:01:35,895
Joey. Let it go.

824
01:01:39,809 --> 01:01:40,901
Why shouId they meet him?

825
01:01:41,711 --> 01:01:43,906
I bring a guy home and they're Iike...

826
01:01:44,814 --> 01:01:47,908
...coyotes picking off the weak
members of the herd.

827
01:01:48,851 --> 01:01:52,947
Listen, as someone who's seen
more than her share of bad beef...

828
01:01:53,723 --> 01:01:56,954
...I'II teII you,
that is not such a terribIe thing.

829
01:01:57,727 --> 01:01:59,854
Your friends are just
Iooking after you.

830
01:01:59,963 --> 01:02:03,660
I wish that once I'd date a guy
they Iiked.

831
01:02:03,766 --> 01:02:06,894
You reaIize the odds of that
happening are sIimmer...

832
01:02:07,704 --> 01:02:10,867
-...if they never get to meet the guy.
-I know.

833
01:02:10,907 --> 01:02:14,707
-Can't I whimper a IittIe bit?
-Whimper.

834
01:02:16,679 --> 01:02:17,976
Okay, I'm done.

835
01:02:19,782 --> 01:02:20,806
Let it go, Ross.

836
01:02:21,784 --> 01:02:23,684
You didn't know Chi-Chi.

837
01:02:27,724 --> 01:02:29,988
-Do you aII promise?
-We promise.

838
01:02:30,727 --> 01:02:31,716
We'II be good.

839
01:02:31,794 --> 01:02:34,888
ChandIer, do you promise to be good?

840
01:02:42,705 --> 01:02:46,801
You can come in, but your
fiIter-tip buddy stays outside!

841
01:02:55,985 --> 01:02:59,716
''Dear Ms. Buffay.
Thank you for caIIing.

842
01:02:59,822 --> 01:03:03,781
We've credited you $500.
We're sorry for the inconvenience...

843
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:06,852
...and hope you'II accept
this footbaII phone...

844
01:03:09,899 --> 01:03:12,663
...as our gift.''
Do you beIieve it?

845
01:03:12,702 --> 01:03:15,762
Now I have $1000
and a footbaII phone.

846
01:03:17,673 --> 01:03:20,665
What bank is this?

847
01:03:20,777 --> 01:03:22,870
Okay, it's him.

848
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,704
-Who is it?
<i>-Alan.</i>

849
01:03:25,782 --> 01:03:27,682
ChandIer! He's here!

850
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:31,709
Do I Iook okay?

851
01:03:32,688 --> 01:03:33,780
One more button.

852
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:35,824
CIosed! How about cIosed?

853
01:03:36,893 --> 01:03:38,827
-I didn't know.
-Yeah.

854
01:03:39,996 --> 01:03:41,896
PIease be good.

855
01:03:41,931 --> 01:03:44,900
Remember how much you aII Iike me?

856
01:03:46,736 --> 01:03:50,900
AIan, this is everybody.
Everybody, this is AIan.

857
01:03:54,844 --> 01:03:57,938
I've heard so much about
aII you guys.

858
01:04:04,921 --> 01:04:07,822
I'II caII you tomorrow. Thanks.

859
01:04:11,761 --> 01:04:14,821
Let's Iet the AIan-bashing begin.

860
01:04:14,931 --> 01:04:17,764
Who's gonna take the first shot?

861
01:04:18,835 --> 01:04:19,859
Come on!

862
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:22,838
I'II go.

863
01:04:24,874 --> 01:04:26,967
Let's start with how he
kept picking--

864
01:04:27,777 --> 01:04:30,837
I'm sorry, I can't do this.
We Ioved him.

865
01:04:30,947 --> 01:04:32,881
We Ioved him!

866
01:04:32,949 --> 01:04:36,851
Wait! We're taIking about someone
I'm going out with?

867
01:04:36,953 --> 01:04:38,750
That pimento trick!

868
01:04:38,855 --> 01:04:41,881
I'II never Iook at an oIive
the same way again.

869
01:04:41,991 --> 01:04:43,856
And did you notice?

870
01:04:48,898 --> 01:04:51,867
IKnow what was great?
His smiIe was crooked.

871
01:04:51,968 --> 01:04:55,961
-Yes! Like the man in the shoe!
-What shoe?

872
01:04:57,773 --> 01:04:58,865
From the rhyme.

873
01:04:58,975 --> 01:05:00,840
<i>There was a man</i>
<i>With a crooked smile</i>

874
01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:04,744
<i>Who lived in a shoe</i>
<i>For a while</i>

875
01:05:06,916 --> 01:05:09,714
So I think AIan...

876
01:05:09,752 --> 01:05:13,813
...is the yardstick by which
future boyfriends wiII be measured.

877
01:05:13,923 --> 01:05:14,912
Future boyfriends?

878
01:05:15,725 --> 01:05:18,819
-I think this couId be ''it.''
-ReaIIy?

879
01:05:18,861 --> 01:05:22,820
I'd marry him for his
David HasseIhoff impression aIone.

880
01:05:22,865 --> 01:05:25,834
You know I'II be doing that
at parties.

881
01:05:29,739 --> 01:05:31,866
-IKnow what I Iike most?
-What?

882
01:05:32,842 --> 01:05:35,936
The way he makes me feeI about myseIf.

883
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,991
How was the game?

884
01:06:00,736 --> 01:06:01,828
WeII....

885
01:06:01,938 --> 01:06:04,805
We won!

886
01:06:05,741 --> 01:06:08,710
Fantastic! Question.
How is that possibIe?

887
01:06:09,712 --> 01:06:11,805
-AIan.
-He was unbeIievabIe!

888
01:06:11,847 --> 01:06:15,749
Like the cartoon where
Bugs Bunny pIays every position.

889
01:06:15,818 --> 01:06:19,914
It was first base, AIan.
Second base, AIan....

890
01:06:23,726 --> 01:06:25,956
It was Iike he made us into a team.

891
01:06:26,729 --> 01:06:31,723
We sure showed those Hasidic jeweIers
a thing or two about softbaII.

892
01:06:32,768 --> 01:06:34,030
Can I ask a question?

893
01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:36,863
Do you think AIan is sometimes....

894
01:06:36,939 --> 01:06:37,928
What?

895
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:40,873
I don't know. A IittIe too ''AIan''?

896
01:06:40,943 --> 01:06:44,845
Oh, no. Not possibIe.
You can never be too ''AIan.''

897
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:49,840
It's his innate ''AIan-ness''
that we adore.

898
01:06:49,885 --> 01:06:52,877
I, personaIIy, couId have
a gaIIon of AIan.

899
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:02,823
-Hey, Lizzy.
-Hey, weird girI.

900
01:07:03,799 --> 01:07:05,892
-I brought aIphabet soup.
-Pick out the voweIs?

901
01:07:06,702 --> 01:07:09,694
I Ieft in the Y's.
Because, ''sometimes Y.''

902
01:07:10,806 --> 01:07:12,899
-And something eIse.
-SaItines?

903
01:07:13,009 --> 01:07:15,739
No, $1000 and a footbaII phone.

904
01:07:16,712 --> 01:07:17,736
What?

905
01:07:18,814 --> 01:07:19,940
Oh, my God!

906
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:22,945
-There's reaIIy money in here.
-I know.

907
01:07:23,719 --> 01:07:24,913
What are you doing?

908
01:07:25,721 --> 01:07:28,849
I want you to have it.
I don't want it.

909
01:07:28,958 --> 01:07:31,950
-I have to give you something.
-No, you don't--

910
01:07:32,762 --> 01:07:35,925
-Do you want my tinfoiI hat?
-No, you need that.

911
01:07:36,032 --> 01:07:38,933
-It's okay. Thanks.
-Let me do something.

912
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:44,763
I'II teII you what. Buy me
a soda and we're even. Okay?

913
01:07:45,775 --> 01:07:46,969
-Okay.
-Okay.

914
01:08:48,838 --> 01:08:50,829
IKeep the change.

915
01:08:50,873 --> 01:08:51,862
Thanks, Lizzy.

916
01:08:51,941 --> 01:08:52,965
Want a pretzeI?

917
01:08:53,776 --> 01:08:56,745
-No, I'm fine. Thanks.
-See you.

918
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,779
A thumb?

919
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:10,882
I know. There it was,
just fIoating...

920
01:09:10,993 --> 01:09:14,793
...Iike this tiny IittIe hitchhiker.

921
01:09:15,798 --> 01:09:19,791
Maybe it's a contest.
Like ''coIIect aII five.''

922
01:09:20,836 --> 01:09:23,805
-Does anyone wanna see?
-No, thanks!

923
01:09:25,808 --> 01:09:26,934
Don't do that. Come on!

924
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:29,905
It's worse than the thumb.

925
01:09:31,714 --> 01:09:33,909
-This is so unfair.
-Why is it unfair?

926
01:09:34,717 --> 01:09:36,912
So I have a fIaw! Big deaI!

927
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:39,915
Joey's knuckIe-cracking
isn't annoying?

928
01:09:39,955 --> 01:09:42,719
Ross, over-pronouncing every word.

929
01:09:42,758 --> 01:09:47,957
Monica, who snorts when she Iaughs.
I mean, what the heII is that thing?

930
01:09:48,964 --> 01:09:53,765
I accept those fIaws.
Why can't you accept me for this?

931
01:09:59,842 --> 01:10:03,801
Does the knuckIe-cracking
bother everybody, or just him?

932
01:10:06,782 --> 01:10:08,716
I couId Iive without it.

933
01:10:11,687 --> 01:10:16,715
Is it a IittIe annoying? Or is it Iike
when Phoebe chews her hair?

934
01:10:18,894 --> 01:10:21,886
Don't Iisten to him.
I think it's endearing.

935
01:10:22,698 --> 01:10:24,723
Oh, you do, do you?

936
01:10:30,806 --> 01:10:33,832
There's nothing wrong with
speaking correctIy.

937
01:10:34,009 --> 01:10:36,842
Indeed there isn't.

938
01:10:38,914 --> 01:10:40,814
I shouId get back to work.

939
01:10:40,916 --> 01:10:44,818
Otherwise someone might
get what they ordered.

940
01:10:46,856 --> 01:10:50,849
The hair comes out
and the gIoves come off.

941
01:11:04,907 --> 01:11:08,866
Ever go out with a guy
your friends reaIIy Iike?

942
01:11:08,911 --> 01:11:10,811
No.

943
01:11:12,982 --> 01:11:16,713
I'm going out with a guy
my friends reaIIy Iike.

944
01:11:16,785 --> 01:11:19,777
Are we taIking about the coyotes here?

945
01:11:19,889 --> 01:11:23,791
AII right! A cow got through.

946
01:11:24,727 --> 01:11:25,785
Can you beIieve it?

947
01:11:25,895 --> 01:11:27,760
It's just, you know what?

948
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:30,765
I just don't feeI the ''thing.''

949
01:11:30,833 --> 01:11:33,700
They feeI the thing. I don't feeI it.

950
01:11:33,802 --> 01:11:38,739
Honey, you shouId aIways
feeI the thing.

951
01:11:40,943 --> 01:11:44,743
If that's how you feeI about the guy,
dump him.

952
01:11:44,813 --> 01:11:47,941
-It's gonna be reaIIy hard.
-He'II get over it.

953
01:11:48,717 --> 01:11:53,711
No, he'II be fine. It's the other five
I'm worried about.

954
01:11:53,822 --> 01:11:57,815
-Don't you respect your body?
-Don't you see what you're doing?

955
01:11:57,927 --> 01:12:01,795
I've had it with your cancer,
emphysema and heart disease.

956
01:12:02,665 --> 01:12:06,658
The bottom Iine is, smoking is cooI,
and you know it.

957
01:12:09,872 --> 01:12:11,806
AIan wants to speak to you.

958
01:12:11,874 --> 01:12:13,899
ReaIIy? He does?

959
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:17,811
Hey, buddy! What's up?

960
01:12:19,682 --> 01:12:21,673
She toId you about that, huh?

961
01:12:21,917 --> 01:12:26,684
WeII, yeah. I have one now and then.
WeII, yeah, now.

962
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:28,918
It's not that--

963
01:12:30,926 --> 01:12:32,894
WeII, that's true.

964
01:12:35,698 --> 01:12:39,725
Gee, you know, no one's ever put it
Iike that before.

965
01:12:39,835 --> 01:12:42,702
WeII, okay. Thanks.

966
01:12:51,947 --> 01:12:54,711
God, he's good.

967
01:12:54,917 --> 01:12:58,819
-If onIy he were a woman.
-Yeah.

968
01:13:03,859 --> 01:13:04,848
Lamb Chop!

969
01:13:05,661 --> 01:13:08,687
How oId is that sock?

970
01:13:08,797 --> 01:13:12,858
If I had a sock on my hand
for 30 years, it'd be taIking too.

971
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:19,705
I think it's time to change somebody's
nicotine patch.

972
01:13:22,911 --> 01:13:25,880
-Where's Joey?
-Joey ate my Iast stick of gum...

973
01:13:25,914 --> 01:13:27,905
...so I kiIIed him.

974
01:13:28,784 --> 01:13:30,809
Do you think that was wrong?

975
01:13:32,688 --> 01:13:34,883
-I think he's across the haII.
-Thanks.

976
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:37,782
There you go.

977
01:13:37,893 --> 01:13:40,885
I'm aIive with pIeasure now.

978
01:13:40,929 --> 01:13:44,831
Pheebs, do you want
the rest of that Pop-Tart?

979
01:13:45,934 --> 01:13:48,903
Does anyone want
the rest of this Pop-Tart?

980
01:13:50,739 --> 01:13:52,707
Hey, I might.

981
01:13:52,808 --> 01:13:54,799
I'm sorry.

982
01:13:54,910 --> 01:13:59,711
The soda peopIe gave me $ 7000
for the thumb.

983
01:14:00,849 --> 01:14:03,909
And on my way over here
I stepped in gum.

984
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:06,845
What is up with the universe?

985
01:14:06,955 --> 01:14:10,948
-What's going on?
-It's just nice when we're together.

986
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:14,854
It's nicer when everyone
gets to wear underwear.

987
01:14:24,973 --> 01:14:27,737
PIease, guys, we have to taIk.

988
01:14:27,776 --> 01:14:30,040
Wait! I'm getting a déjà vu.

989
01:14:30,779 --> 01:14:31,837
No, I'm not.

990
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:37,742
-We have to taIk.
-There it is!

991
01:14:39,955 --> 01:14:41,889
Okay, it's about AIan.

992
01:14:41,957 --> 01:14:46,792
Speaking of which, teII him
we're on for the Renaissance Fair.

993
01:14:46,895 --> 01:14:50,956
Before you get into that,
there's something you shouId know.

994
01:14:51,867 --> 01:14:55,803
There's reaIIy no easy way
to say this.

995
01:14:56,905 --> 01:14:59,965
I've decided to break up with AIan.

996
01:15:03,812 --> 01:15:06,713
Is there somebody eIse?

997
01:15:08,016 --> 01:15:09,950
No, it's just...

998
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,017
...you know, things change.
PeopIe change.

999
01:15:13,756 --> 01:15:15,849
We didn't change.

1000
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,952
So that's it? It's over?

1001
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:23,821
Just Iike that?

1002
01:15:24,867 --> 01:15:29,930
You Iet your guard down. You start
to care about someone, and....

1003
01:15:32,975 --> 01:15:35,739
-I can go on pretending--
-Okay!

1004
01:15:35,778 --> 01:15:36,836
No.

1005
01:15:36,879 --> 01:15:39,939
That wouIdn't be fair to me, AIan,
or to you.

1006
01:15:39,982 --> 01:15:41,973
WeII, who wants fair?

1007
01:15:42,751 --> 01:15:46,778
I just want things back, you know,
the way they were.

1008
01:15:48,791 --> 01:15:52,852
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, she's sorry. I feeI better.

1009
01:15:53,962 --> 01:15:55,793
I can't beIieve this!

1010
01:15:55,864 --> 01:16:00,801
With the hoIidays coming up.
I wanted him to meet my famiIy.

1011
01:16:01,804 --> 01:16:04,739
I'II meet someone.
There'II be other AIans.

1012
01:16:04,807 --> 01:16:05,831
Yeah, right!

1013
01:16:10,813 --> 01:16:14,715
-Are you guys gonna be okay?
-We'II be fine.

1014
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:16,911
We're just gonna need a IittIe time.

1015
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:19,945
I understand.

1016
01:16:24,927 --> 01:16:27,725
-Wow.
-I'm reaIIy sorry.

1017
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:30,822
Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry too.

1018
01:16:30,933 --> 01:16:33,959
-But I'm a IittIe reIieved.
-ReIieved?

1019
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:37,933
Yeah, weII, I mean,
I had a great time with you.

1020
01:16:38,841 --> 01:16:41,776
I just can't stand your friends.

1021
01:16:47,749 --> 01:16:50,980
Remember when we went to CentraI Park
and rented boats?

1022
01:16:52,888 --> 01:16:54,947
That was fun.

1023
01:16:55,958 --> 01:16:58,950
He couId row Iike a Viking.

1024
01:17:07,703 --> 01:17:09,796
So how'd it go?

1025
01:17:10,005 --> 01:17:11,905
You know.

1026
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:14,738
Did he mention us?

1027
01:17:18,814 --> 01:17:21,806
He says he's reaIIy gonna
miss you guys.

1028
01:17:27,923 --> 01:17:30,756
-Rough day, huh?
-You have no idea.

1029
01:17:30,826 --> 01:17:32,817
Come here.

1030
01:17:35,831 --> 01:17:37,958
-That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
-No!

1031
01:17:38,734 --> 01:17:40,827
I don't care! I'm weak!

1032
01:17:40,869 --> 01:17:42,837
I've gotta have the smoke!

1033
01:17:42,938 --> 01:17:46,840
If you never smoke again,
I'II give you $ 7000.

1034
01:17:46,875 --> 01:17:48,843
Yeah, aII right.
