2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,197
There's nothing to tell. It's just some guy I work with.

3
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:05,939
You're going out with the guy.

4
00:00:06,039 --> 00:00:08,166
There has to be something wrong with him.

5
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,967
All right, Joey. Be nice.

6
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:13,171
So does he have a hump and a hairpiece?

7
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:17,982
Wait, does he eat chalk?

8
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:21,145
I don't want her to go through what I did with Carl.

9
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:25,181
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date.

10
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:30,055
It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.

11
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:33,156
Sounds like a date to me.

12
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:37,967
I'm in high school, in the cafeteria...

13
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:41,065
...and I realize I'm totally naked.

14
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:43,075
I've had that dream.

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,078
Then I look down and I realize there is a phone...

16
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:50,173
...there.

17
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:54,019
Instead of
That's right!

18
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:55,985
Never had that one.

19
00:00:56,023 --> 00:01:00,187
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.

20
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:03,292
What do I do? Everyone starts looking at me.

21
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:06,125
They weren't looking at you before?

22
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:11,036
Finally, I figure I'd better answer it.

23
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:15,040
And it turns out it's my mother.

24
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:19,101
Which is very, very weird because she never calls me.

25
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:26,982
Hi.

26
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:31,957
He says, ''Hello,'' I want to kill myself.

27
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:33,982
You okay?

28
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:39,159
I feel like someone pulled my intestine out of my mouth...

29
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:44,063
...and tied it around my neck. 
Cookie?

30
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:47,105
Carol moved her stuff out today.

31
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:50,200
Let me get you some coffee. 
Thanks.

32
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:59,075
No, don't! Stop cleansing my aura.

33
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:03,953
Just leave my aura alone, okay? 
Fine, be murky.

34
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,958
I'll be fine. I hope she'll be happy. 
No, you don't.

35
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:11,156
No, I don't. To hell with her. She left me!

36
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:14,127
You never knew she was a lesbian?

37
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,939
No! Okay?

38
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,032
Why does everyone keep fixating on that?

39
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:28,045
She didn't know. How should I know?

40
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:33,041
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

41
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,979
Did I say that out loud?

42
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:41,993
I told Mom and Dad last night. They took it pretty well.

43
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:43,084
Oh, really?

44
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:47,065
So that hysterical phone call from a woman sobbing...

45
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:52,003
...''I'll never have grandchildren,'' was what? A wrong number?

46
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:53,061
Sorry.

47
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:57,075
Look, you're feeling a lot of pain right now.

48
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,010
You're angry. You're hurting.

49
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,173
Can I tell you what the answer is?

50
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,944
Strip joints!

51
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,112
Hey, you're single. Have some hormones.

52
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:11,920
But I don't want to be single, okay?

53
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,119
I just want to be married again.

54
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,130
And I just want a million dollars!

55
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,237
Rachel? 
Oh, Monica! Thank God!

56
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,978
I went to your building...

57
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,948
...and a guy with a hammer said you'd be here, and you are.

58
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,986
Can I get you some coffee? 
Decaf.

59
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:45,056
Everybody, this is Rachel, a Lincoln High survivor.

60
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:47,959
This is everybody. Chandler and Phoebe...

61
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,052
...Joey. Remember my brother, Ross?

62
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,187
Sure!

63
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:06,009
You want to tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

64
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:12,017
Well, it started about a half
hour before the wedding.

65
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:15,020
I was in the room with all the presents...

66
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:20,960
...and I was looking at this really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.

67
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:22,928
When all of a sudden

68
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,019
Sweet 'N Low?

69
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:30,125
I realized I was more turned on by this gravy boat than Barry.

70
00:04:30,237 --> 00:04:33,138
I got freaked out, and it hit me:

71
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,135
How much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head.

72
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:40,171
I always knew he looked familiar, but....

73
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,144
I had to get out of there, and I started wondering...

74
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:50,088
...''Why am I doing this,'' and ''Who am I doing it for?''

75
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:54,150
I didn't know where to go, and I know we've drifted apart...

76
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:57,963
...but you're the only person I know here.

77
00:04:58,065 --> 00:05:03,162
Who wasn't invited to the wedding. 
I hoped that wouldn't be an issue.

78
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:24,913
I guess he bought her the pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.

79
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:28,026
''Tuna or egg salad! Decide!''

80
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:34,065
''I'll have whatever Christina's having.''

81
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:37,934
Daddy, I just
 I can't marry him.

82
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:43,031
I'm sorry. I just don't love him.

83
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:47,136
Well, it matters to me!

84
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:54,180
''If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.''

85
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:59,056
She should not be wearing those pants.

86
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,992
Push her down the stairs!

87
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:04,028
Push her! Push her down the stairs!

88
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:11,036
Come on, Daddy, listen!

89
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:16,001
All my life, everyone's always told me, ''You're a shoe!''

90
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,203
''You're a shoe!''

91
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,937
What if I don't want to be a shoe?

92
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:25,007
What if I want to be a purse?

93
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,951
Or a hat?

94
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,919
No, I don't want you to buy me a hat!

95
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:34,050
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

96
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:38,124
You can see where he'd have trouble.

97
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,966
Look, Daddy, it's my life.

98
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:46,970
Well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.

99
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:52,136
I guess we've established she's staying with Monica.

100
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:56,039
Well, maybe that's my decision.

101
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,174
Maybe I don't need your money.

102
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:01,987
Wait! I said maybe!

103
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,998
Just breathe. That's it.

104
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:14,899
Try to think of nice, calm things.

105
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,095
<i>Raindrops on roses</i> <i>And whiskers on kittens</i>

106
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:23,000
<i>Doorbells and sleigh bells</i> <i>And something with mittens</i>

107
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:27,141
<i>La la la something</i> <i>And noodles with string</i>

108
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:29,948
I'm all better now.

109
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,113
I helped.

110
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:37,953
This is probably for the best.

111
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:43,123
Independence. Controlling your life. The whole hat thing.

112
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:47,190
You can always come to Joey.

113
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:51,131
Me and Chandler live across the hall. He's away a lot.

114
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,972
Stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day.

115
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,134
Like there's a rule, or something?

116
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,910
I got it.

117
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:07,145
Please don't do that again. It's a horrible sound.

118
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,080
<i>It's Paul.</i>

119
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,983
Oh, God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in.

120
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,891
Who's Paul? 
Paul, the wine guy?

121
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:16,985
Maybe.

122
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:20,124
Your ''not a real date'' is with Paul, the wine guy?

123
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,027
He finally asked you out? 
Yes!

124
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:25,936
It's a ''Dear Diary'' moment.

125
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:29,100
Rach, I can cancel. 
Please, go, I'll be fine.

126
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:34,038
Ross, are you okay? Do you want me to stay?

127
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:37,048
That'd be good.

128
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:42,111
Really? 
Go on! It's Paul, the wine guy!

129
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,048
Does he sell it, drink it?

130
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,060
Or he just complains a lot?

131
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,926
Hi, come in! Paul, this is...

132
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,125
...everybody. Everybody, this is Paul.

133
00:08:56,069 --> 00:09:00,028
The wine guy. 
I didn't catch your name. Paul?

134
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:04,967
I'll be right back. I've just gotta go

135
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,138
A
wandering?

136
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:08,971
Change.

137
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,175
Sit down. Two seconds.

138
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:19,955
I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.

139
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:26,063
Hey, Paul, here's a tip.

140
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:30,968
She really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot...

141
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,972
...until it starts to get red.

142
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:37,168
Shut up, Joey!

143
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,002
What are you up to tonight?

144
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,177
I was supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon...

145
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:47,077
...so, nothing.

146
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:51,214
Right. You're not even getting your honeymoon.

147
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,221
Although, Aruba. This time of year?

148
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:57,087
Talk about your...

149
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,996
...big lizards.

150
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:06,070
If you don't want to be alone tonight...

151
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:09,973
...Joey and Chandler are helping me with my furniture.

152
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,170
We're very excited about it.

153
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,972
Thanks. But I'm just going to hang out here.

154
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:18,073
It's been a long day. 
Oh, sure.

155
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,947
Pheebs, wanna help?

156
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:23,988
I wish I could, but I don't want to.

157
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:38,004
<i>Love is sweet as summer showers</i> <i>Love is a wondrous work of art</i>

158
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:44,007
<i>But your love</i> <i>Oh, your love, your love</i>

159
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:48,173
<i>Is like a giant pigeon</i>

160
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,179
<i>Crapping on my heart</i>

161
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,989
Thank you.

162
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:09,158
I'm supposed to attach a bracket
y thing to the side things...

163
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:12,166
...using a bunch of these little worm guys.

164
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,170
I have no bracket
y thing. I see no worm guys whatsoever...

165
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:21,175
...and I cannot feel my legs.

166
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:28,953
We got a bookcase. 
It's beautiful.

167
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,952
What's this?

168
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,984
I would have to say that is an L
shaped bracket.

169
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:40,155
Which goes where? 
I have no idea.

170
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:45,194
Done with the bookcase. 
All finished.

171
00:11:48,975 --> 00:11:52,001
This was Carol's favorite beer.

172
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:56,971
She always drank it out of the can. I should have known.

173
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:05,113
Start with that, we're out of here. 
Please don't spoil all this fun.

174
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,022
Let me ask you.

175
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,156
She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV.

176
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:13,159
What did you get?

177
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,959
You guys. 
You got screwed.

178
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:21,234
Oh, my God. 
I know. I'm such an idiot.

179
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:26,139
I should've known when she went to the dentist five times a week.

180
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,976
I mean, how clean can teeth get?

181
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,141
My brother's going through that.

182
00:12:31,951 --> 00:12:33,077
How did you get over it?

183
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:36,986
He might accidentally break something valuable of hers.

184
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,955
Say her
Leg?

185
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:42,994
That's one way of doing it. I went for the watch.

186
00:12:43,196 --> 00:12:46,063
You actually broke her watch?

187
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:50,160
The worst I ever did was shred my old boyfriend's favorite towel.

188
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,098
Steer clear of you. 
That's right.

189
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:57,977
Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

190
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:03,174
You probably think it's about making love with your socks on, but it isn't.

191
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,111
It's about me. And I just

192
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:16,018
The machine cut me off again. Anyway....

193
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:25,961
I know that some lucky girl is going to become Mrs. Barry Finkel.

194
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,941
But it isn't me. It's not me.

195
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:34,139
Not that I have any idea who ''me'' is right now, but you just

196
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,142
I'm divorced.

197
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:44,982
I'm only 26, and I'm divorced! 
Shut up!

198
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,993
That only took me an hour.

199
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:59,063
We haven't had a relationship that's lasted longer than a Mento.

200
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,033
You have had the love of a woman for four years.

201
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:09,912
Four years of closeness and sharing, after which she ripped your heart out.

202
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,941
That is why we don't do it!

203
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:17,047
I don't think that was my point!

204
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:21,150
Know what's scary? What if there's only one woman for everybody?

205
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:24,954
I mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it?

206
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:30,025
Unfortunately, in my case, there was only one woman for her.

207
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:35,132
What are you talking about? One woman.

208
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:39,170
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream.

209
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:43,973
Let me tell you something. There's lots of flavors out there.

210
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,043
Rocky road and cookie dough and bing cherry vanilla.

211
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:53,082
You can get them with jimmies or nuts or whipped cream.

212
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,087
It's the best thing to happen to you!

213
00:14:56,195 --> 00:15:00,154
You got married. You were like, what, 8?

214
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,002
Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon!

215
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:09,905
I don't know if I'm hungry or horny. 
Then stay out of my freezer.

216
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:17,006
Ever since she walked out on me....

217
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,118
What?

218
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,012
You wanna spell it out with noodles?

219
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:27,024
It's more of a fifth date kind of revelation.

220
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,929
So there's going to be a fifth date?

221
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,158
Isn't there?

222
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,026
Yeah, yeah. I think there is.

223
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,963
What were you going to say?

224
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:47,169
Ever since she left me...

225
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,177
...I haven't been able to perform...

226
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,050
...sexually.

227
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,146
Oh, God! I'm so sorry.

228
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:02,992
Being spit on is probably not what you need right now.

229
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,927
How long?

230
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:09,024
Two years. 
Wow.

231
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:13,095
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

232
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:19,034
So you still think you might want that fifth date?

233
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:24,940
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

234
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:30,111
<i>We are gathered here</i> <i>to join Joanie Louise Cunningham...</i>

235
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:35,958
<i>...and Charles.</i> <i>Chachi, Chachi, Chachi...</i>

236
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:40,928
<i>...in the bonds of holy matrimony.</i>

237
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,989
See!

238
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:48,064
But Joanie loved Chachi. That's the difference.

239
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:50,975
''Grab a spoon.''

240
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,137
Do you know how long it's been since I grabbed a spoon?

241
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:59,077
Do the words, ''Billy, don't be a hero,'' mean anything to you?

242
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,924
Great story. But I gotta go.

243
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:10,929
I got a date with Andrea. Angela. No, Andrea.

244
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:14,125
Andrea's the screamer. Angela has cats.

245
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:19,099
Right, thanks. It's Julie. I'm out of here.

246
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:25,036
Here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough...

247
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:28,012
...to ask a woman out...

248
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,947
...who am I going to ask?

249
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,975
Isn't this amazing? I've never made coffee in my life.

250
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,170
That is amazing. 
Congratulations.

251
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,177
If I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.

252
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:10,078
I think it's, ''If I can invade Poland, there's nothing I can't do.''

253
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:15,025
If you feel like you have to make a Western omelet or something....

254
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:21,193
Although, actually I'm really not that hungry.

255
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,029
Oh, good. Lenny and Squiggy are here.

256
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:28,931
Good morning. 
Good morning.

257
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,911
Morning. 
Morning, Paul.

258
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:35,947
Hello, Paul. 
Hi. Paul, is it?

259
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:45,957
Thank you so much. 
Stop.

260
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:50,155
Last night was like all my birthdays, both graduations...

261
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,124
...plus the barn
raising scene in <i>Witness.</i>

262
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:00,231
We'll talk later.

263
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:07,239
Thank you.

264
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:18,048
That wasn't a real date.

265
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,150
What the hell do you do on a real date?

266
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:25,186
Shut up and put my table back.

267
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,066
I've got to get to work.

268
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:33,970
If I don't input those numbers, it doesn't make much of a difference.

269
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,170
So, like, you guys all have jobs?

270
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,110
Yeah, we all have jobs. That's how we buy stuff.

271
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:51,213
Yeah, I'm an actor. 
Have I seen you in anything?

272
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:54,084
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.

273
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:57,994
Unless you saw the Wee One's production of <i>Pinocchio...</i>

274
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,999
...at the little theater in the park?

275
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,192
It was a job!

276
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,128
''Look, Geppetto. I'm a real live boy.''

277
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:12,033
I will not take this abuse. 
You're right, I'm sorry.

278
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:14,979
<i>Once I was a wooden boy</i> <i>A little wooden boy</i>

279
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:21,176
You should both know that he's a dead man.

280
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,945
Oh, Chandler!

281
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:28,151
How are you doing today? Sleep okay?

282
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:32,196
Did you talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.

283
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:37,095
I see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.

284
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,066
I know. He's just so....

285
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:48,180
Remember you and Tony Demarco? 
Oh, yeah.

286
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:52,116
Well, it's like that. With feelings.

287
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,088
Wow, are you in trouble! 
Big time!

288
00:20:56,288 --> 00:21:00,019
Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.

289
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,220
I think we're getting a little ahead of ourselves.

290
00:21:03,963 --> 00:21:08,127
I'm going to get up, go to work, and not think about him all day.

291
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:12,127
Or else I'm going to get up and go to work.

292
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:14,071
Wish me luck! 
What for?

293
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,941
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.

294
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:31,148
Hi, Monica. 
Franny, welcome back.

295
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:34,954
How was Florida? 
You had sex, didn't you?

296
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:39,055
How do you do that? 
I hate you.

297
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:43,091
I'm pushing my aunt through Parrot Jungle, you're having sex.

298
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:46,195
So, who?

299
00:21:47,073 --> 00:21:48,165
You know Paul?

300
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:52,068
Paul, the wine guy? Yeah, I know Paul.

301
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,078
You mean, you know Paul like I know Paul?

302
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:59,174
What? I take credit for Paul.

303
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:03,944
Before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.

304
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,926
Of course it was a line.

305
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,930
Why would anybody do something like that?

306
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:16,058
I assume we want an answer more sophisticated than:

307
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:19,127
''To get you into bed.''

308
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,969
I hate men.

309
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:26,068
Don't hate. You don't want to put that out into the universe.

310
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,975
Is it me?

311
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:31,949
Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs...

312
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,178
...and men with emotional problems can hear?

313
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:38,047
Come here. Give me your feet.

314
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:47,155
I just thought he was nice, you know?

315
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:54,263
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line.

316
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:00,011
Guess what? 
You got a job?

317
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:04,106
Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing.

318
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:08,148
I was laughed out of 1 2 interviews. 
You're surprisingly upbeat.

319
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:12,014
You'd be too, if you found these boots on sale...

320
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:17,118
How well you know me.

321
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:21,024
They're my ''I don't need a job...

322
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,124
...I've got great boots'' boots.

323
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,029
How did you pay? 
Credit card.

324
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:30,074
And who pays for that?

325
00:23:30,176 --> 00:23:33,077
My father.

326
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:39,176
Is this really necessary? I can stop charging any time.

327
00:23:39,952 --> 00:23:42,045
You can't live off your parents.

328
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,989
I know that. That's why I was getting married.

329
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,955
Give her a break. It's hard being on your own.

330
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:51,051
Thank you.

331
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,259
I remember when I first came to this city, I was 1 4.

332
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,969
Mom had killed herself, stepdad was in jail.

333
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,004
I didn't know anybody here.

334
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:04,906
I ended up living with this albino guy who was cleaning windshields.

335
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,910
And then he killed himself.

336
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:11,210
Then I found aromatherapy. So I know exactly how you feel.

337
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,147
The word you're looking for is:

338
00:24:18,057 --> 00:24:20,924
''Anyway....''

339
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:28,127
You ready? 
No, how can I be ready?

340
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:31,169
''Ready to jump out of the plane with no parachute?''

341
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,962
I can't do this. 
I know you can.

342
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:37,065
No. 
You made coffee, you can do anything.

343
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,937
Cut. Cut. Cut.

344
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:51,150
You know what? I think we can leave it at that.

345
00:24:51,257 --> 00:24:55,250
Kind of a symbolic gesture. 
Rachel, that was a library card.

346
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:07,036
If you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.

347
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:12,009
Welcome to the real world!

348
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:15,137
It sucks. You're gonna love it.

349
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:26,148
That's it. Are you going to crash on the couch?

350
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:30,918
No, I gotta go home sometime. 
Are you gonna be okay?

351
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:36,025
Look what I just found on the floor.

352
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:38,129
What?

353
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:42,139
That's Paul's watch. Just put it back where you found it.

354
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,068
Oh, boy! All right.

355
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:49,976
Good night, everybody. 
Good night.

356
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:04,928
I'm sorry. Have it, I don't want it. 
Split it?

357
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:12,128
You probably didn't know this, but in high school...

358
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:15,098
...I had a major crush on you.

359
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,001
I knew.

360
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,102
You did?

361
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:25,042
I figured you thought I was Monica's geeky brother.

362
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:27,108
I did.

363
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:33,924
Listen, do you think...?

364
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:38,953
Try not to let my vulnerability become a factor here.

365
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:43,225
Do you think it would be okay if I asked you out sometime?

366
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,933
Yeah.

367
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,063
Maybe.

368
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:52,134
Okay.

369
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:57,972
Okay, maybe I will.

370
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:05,113
Good night. 
Good night.

371
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:20,929
See you.

372
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,907
Wait, wait. What's with you?

373
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:31,139
I just grabbed a spoon.

374
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:41,950
I can't believe what I'm hearing. <i>
Can't believe what I'm hearing</i>

375
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,052
What? I said
 <i>
What? I said</i>

376
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,928
Would you stop? 
Was I doing it again?

377
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,058
Yes!

378
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:55,038
I said you had a nice butt. It's just not a great butt.

379
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:59,134
You won't know a butt if it bit you. 
There's an image.

380
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,972
Would anybody like more coffee?

381
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,077
You made it, or you're serving it?

382
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,022
I'm just serving it. 
I'll have a cup of coffee.

383
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,921
Kids, new dream.

384
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,016
I'm in Las Vegas.

385
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,994
Miss, more coffee?

386
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:22,032
Could you give this to that guy over there?

387
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:25,131
Go ahead. Thank you.

388
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:28,099
Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.

389
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,898
I'm in Las Vegas.

390
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,003
I'm Liza Minnelli....
