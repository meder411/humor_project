392
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,992
For us, kissing is as important as any part.

393
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:04,195
Yeah, right!

394
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:08,199
You serious?

395
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,141
Oh, yeah.

396
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:14,044
Everything is in that first kiss. 
Absolutely.

397
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:17,015
For us, kissing's an opening act...

398
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,110
...like the comedian you have to sit through...

399
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:22,145
...before Pink Floyd comes out.

400
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:29,025
And it's not that we don't like the comedian.

401
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:34,123
It's just that that's not why we bought the ticket.

402
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:40,163
The problem is, no matter how great the show was...

403
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,074
...you girls are looking for the comedian again.

404
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:49,138
We're in the car, fighting traffic, just trying to stay awake.

405
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,086
Word of advice: Bring back the comedian.

406
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:59,023
Or next time you'll find yourself listening to that album alone.

407
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,097
Are we still talking about sex?

408
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:09,192
The One With the Sonogram at the End

409
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,185
No, it's good. It is good.

410
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:03,115
It's just that
 Doesn't she seem a little angry?

411
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,986
Well, she has issues.

412
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:07,983
Does she?

413
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:10,188
Try to live with ''Mr. I'm Evolving.''

414
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:17,995
He's out while she's home getting the mastodon smell out of the carpet.

415
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,198
Marsha, see, these are cave people.

416
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,234
Okay, they have issues like:

417
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:28,206
''Gee, that glacier's getting kind of close.''

418
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:32,048
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex
wife?

419
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:34,053
No. 
Yes, it is. Carol, hi!

420
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:38,147
Okay. Yes, it is. I'll catch up with you in the Ice Age.

421
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,158
Can I stay? 
No.

422
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,201
Hi. 
Hi.

423
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,085
Is this a bad time? 
No, it's...

424
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,212
...the Stone Age.

425
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:15,223
You look great. I hate that.

426
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,996
Sorry. Thanks. You look good too.

427
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,295
Well, you know, in here, anyone who...

428
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,001
...stands erect....

429
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:32,101
What's new? Still a
A lesbian?

430
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,244
You never know. How's the family?

431
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:43,112
Marty's still totally paranoid. 
Carol, why are you here?

432
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,253
I'm pregnant. 
Pregnant.

433
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,968
<i>She didn't leave</i> <i>in such a hurry after all.</i>

434
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:03,204
This is the <i>Three's Company</i> episode with a misunderstanding.

435
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:09,114
Then I've already seen this one.

436
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,083
Are you through with that?

437
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:15,086
Sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.

438
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,123
Whose ball of paper is this?

439
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:22,184
Mine. I wrote a note to myself, then I didn't need it.

440
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,221
So I balled it up and now I wish I was dead.

441
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:32,094
She already fluffed that pillow. You already fluffed
 It's fine.

442
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,203
I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition.

443
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:40,236
Parents can be cruel about the flatness of a child's pillow.

444
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:46,015
Relax, you do this every time. The place looks great.

445
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:49,216
You got a lasagna here that looks good enough...

446
00:04:49,256 --> 00:04:51,156
...to avoid touching.

447
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:55,990
Monica? Hi!

448
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,091
Monica, you're scaring me.

449
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:05,068
I mean, you're all chaotic and twirly, you know?

450
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,196
Not in a good way.

451
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:14,113
Calm down. You don't see Ross getting twirly every time they come.

452
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:18,116
That's because my parents think Ross can do no wrong.

453
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,176
You see, he's ''The Prince.''

454
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,088
They had some big ceremony before I was born.

455
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,189
What? 
Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.

456
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:39,002
Has anybody seen my engagement ring? 
It's beautiful.

457
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,036
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

458
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:49,048
No, don't touch that.

459
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:55,951
Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back.

460
00:05:55,989 --> 00:06:01,052
''Hi, Barry, remember me? I'm the girl that stomped on your heart.''

461
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:04,187
Now I must return the ring without the ring...

462
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:07,957
...which makes it so much harder.

463
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,192
Easy, we'll find it. Won't we?

464
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,270
Look, it's gonna be okay. You'll give it back...

465
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:19,001
...and we'll eat ice cream. 
Okay. It's a pear
shaped diamond

466
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,104
Any diamond ring we find, we'll run it by you.

467
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:28,176
When did you have it last? 
Doy, right before she lost it.

468
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,219
You don't get a lot of ''doy'' these days.

469
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,993
I know I had it this morning.

470
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:41,090
I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with

471
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:42,998
Dinah?

472
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:49,100
Oh, don't be mad. 
You didn't.

473
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:53,236
Oh, I'm sorry. 
I gave you one job!

474
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,175
But look how straight those noodles are.

475
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:03,054
That's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagna.

476
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,989
I just can't do it.

477
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,962
Boys? We're going in.

478
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,095
Hi.

479
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,203
That is not a happy ''hi.'' 
Carol's pregnant.

480
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,072
I found it!

481
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:33,209
What
?

482
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,111
Yeah.

483
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:41,025
Do that for two hours, you might be where I am about now.

484
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:45,088
That puts that whole pillow thing in perspective.

485
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,033
How do you fit into this whole thing?

486
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,003
Carol and Susan want me to be involved.

487
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:57,941
But if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.

488
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:02,074
It's totally up to me. 
She is so great. I miss her.

489
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:11,249
What does she mean by ''involved''? 
Your job is done.

490
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,188
And the most enjoyable.

491
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,154
Phoebe, say something.

492
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:22,997
They want me to go down to this sonogram thing...

493
00:08:23,103 --> 00:08:24,968
...with them tomorrow.

494
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,062
Remember when life was simpler...

495
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,971
...and she was just a lesbian?

496
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,104
Those were the days.

497
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,177
What are you gonna do? 
I have no idea.

498
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:41,176
No matter what I do, I'm still gonna be a father.

499
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,222
This is still ruined, right?

500
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:02,973
Martha Lugwin's daughter is gonna call you.

501
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:09,079
What's that curry taste? 
Curry.

502
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:16,178
I think they're great. I really do.

503
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,982
The big Lugwin had a thing for you.

504
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:23,256
They all had a thing for him. 
Oh, Mom.

505
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,056
Why is this girl going to call me?

506
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:32,105
She just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking or food....

507
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:35,003
I told her you have a restaurant

508
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:39,978
I don't have, I work in a restaurant. 
They don't have to know that.

509
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:47,111
Ross, help me with the spaghetti. 
Yes.

510
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:51,089
Oh, we're having spaghetti. That's easy.

511
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,126
We were going to have lasagna.

512
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:57,186
I love lasagna. 
We're not having it.

513
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:01,190
Then why bring it up? He latches on.

514
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,198
This will sound unbelievably selfish...

515
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:10,203
...but did you plan to bring up the baby/lesbian thing?

516
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,108
It might take the heat off of me.

517
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:20,051
That Rachel. We saw her parents at the club.

518
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,145
They were not playing well.

519
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,247
I won't say what they spent...

520
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:27,219
...but $40,000 is a lot for a wedding.

521
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:34,166
At least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar.

522
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,139
What's that supposed to mean? 
Nothing.

523
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:43,265
It's an expression. 
No, it's not.

524
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:47,069
Don't listen to her. You've always been independent.

525
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:49,272
Even when you were a chubby kid...

526
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:53,075
...and you had no friends, you were just fine.

527
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:57,280
You'd read alone in your room. Your puzzles....

528
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:05,096
People like Ross need to shoot for the stars.

529
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:08,133
With his museum and his published papers.

530
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:12,034
Others are satisfied with staying where they are.

531
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,232
These people never get cancer.

532
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,001
They're happy with what they have, content...

533
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,036
...like cows.

534
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,142
Cows, Dad?

535
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,213
She knows how much I love cows.

536
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:34,116
I read about women trying to have it all, and I thank God...

537
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:37,219
...our ''Harmonica'' doesn't have that problem.

538
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:43,263
I'm telling you, you'll be fine. 
Thank you, Daddy.

539
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,036
Oh, so this does work.

540
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,239
So, Ross, what's going on with you?

541
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:59,184
Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?

542
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:06,117
Look, I realize you guys have been wondering...

543
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:09,184
...what exactly happened between Carol and me.

544
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:12,191
And so, well, here's the deal.

545
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,031
Carol's a lesbian.

546
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,196
She lives with a woman named Susan.

547
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,109
She's pregnant with my child.

548
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:29,104
She and Susan are going to raise the baby.

549
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,313
And you knew about this?

550
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,222
Folks are really that bad?

551
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:48,159
Well, you know, these people are pros.

552
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,067
They know what they do.

553
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:56,107
They take their time. They get the job done.

554
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:01,003
They say that you can't change your parents.

555
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,106
Boy, if you could, I'd want yours.

556
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,074
Must pee.

557
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,990
It's worse when you're twins.

558
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:13,015
You're a twin? 
We don't speak.

559
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:16,084
She's this high
powered, driven, career
type.

560
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:19,096
What does she do? 
She's a waitress.

561
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:23,100
Identical? 
People say we look alike.

562
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,294
But I don't see it.

563
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,997
You guys, I kind of gotta clean up now.

564
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:32,043
Chandler, as an only child, you don't have this.

565
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:35,205
No, although I did have an imaginary friend...

566
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,209
...who my parents preferred.

567
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,010
Hit the lights, please.

568
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,028
How long was I in there?

569
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:56,161
I'm just cleaning up. 
Oh, you need any help?

570
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,969
Okay, sure. Thanks.

571
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,167
Anyway....

572
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:10,979
So you nervous about Barry tomorrow?

573
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:12,209
A little.

574
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,984
A lot.

575
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,217
So, got any advice?

576
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:23,087
You know, as someone who's recently been dumped.

577
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:27,999
You may wanna steer clear of the word ''dumped.''

578
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:33,129
Chances are he's gonna be this broken shell of a man.

579
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:39,007
You should try not to look too terrific. I know it'll be hard.

580
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:45,141
Or I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring.

581
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:50,120
And you can go with Carol and Susan to the ob
gyn.

582
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,252
You've got Carol tomorrow.

583
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:59,062
When did it get so complicated? 
Got me.

584
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,160
Remember being in high school? 
Yeah.

585
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,096
Didn't you think you'd meet someone...

586
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,969
...fall in love, and that'd be it?

587
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,071
Ross? 
Yes. Yes.

588
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:21,215
Man, I never thought I'd be here.

589
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,186
Me neither.

590
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,105
Sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work.

591
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:53,049
There was this big dinosaur thing. Anyway....

592
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,315
Hi.

593
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:59,082
You remember Susan. 
How could I forget?

594
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:03,060
Hello, Susan. Good shake, good shake.

595
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:08,067
So, we're just waiting for
?

596
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:10,194
Dr. Oberman. 
And is he
?

597
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,961
She. 
Of course, ''she.''

598
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:18,166
Is she familiar with our special situation?

599
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,971
Yes, and she's very supportive. 
Okay, that's great.

600
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,172
No, I'm
 Oh.

601
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,110
Thanks.

602
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,141
That opens my cervix.

603
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,974
Barry? 
Come on in.

604
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:01,943
Are you sure? 
It's fine.

605
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,080
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

606
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:09,188
So, how are you doing?

607
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:11,952
I'm....

608
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,157
I'm okay.

609
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:18,163
You look great. 
Yeah, well.

610
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:21,266
<i>Dr. Farber, Jason Greenspan's gagging.</i>

611
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:24,977
Be right there. Be back in a second.

612
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,209
I dumped him.

613
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,129
So, how's this all gonna work?

614
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:56,073
The baby grows in a special place inside

615
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:57,166
Thank you.

616
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:01,937
I mean, how's this gonna work, you know, with us?

617
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,050
When important decisions have to be made?

618
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:08,950
Give me a ''for instance.'' 
Well, I don't know.

619
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:12,149
How about with the baby's name? 
Marlon.

620
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,086
If it's a boy. Minnie, if it's a girl.

621
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:18,994
As in ''Mouse''?

622
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,962
As in my grandmother.

623
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:25,961
Still, you say ''Minnie,'' you hear ''Mouse.''

624
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,201
How about...?

625
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,168
How about Julia?

626
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:34,976
Julia. 
We agreed on Minnie.

627
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:37,982
We agreed we'd spend our lives together.

628
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:40,211
Things change. Roll with the punches.

629
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:43,178
I believe Julia's on the table?

630
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,989
Sorry about that.

631
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,191
So, what have you been up to?

632
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,025
Oh, not much.

633
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,063
I got a job. 
That's great.

634
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,037
Why are you so tan?

635
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:06,978
I went to Aruba.

636
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,980
Oh, no. You went on our honeymoon alone?

637
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,071
No.

638
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,148
I went with....

639
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:19,957
Now, this may hurt. 
Me?

640
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,050
No.

641
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,054
I went with Mindy.

642
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:26,989
Mindy?

643
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,193
My maid of honor, Mindy?

644
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,971
Yeah, we're kind of a thing now.

645
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,077
You got plugs!

646
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:42,080
Careful. They haven't quite taken yet.

647
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,114
And you got lenses.

648
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:48,076
You hate sticking your finger in your eye.

649
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,985
Not for her.

650
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,092
Listen, I really wanted to thank you.

651
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,122
Okay.

652
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:04,035
A month ago, I wanted to hurt you more than I've ever wanted to.

653
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:06,094
And I'm an orthodontist.

654
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:11,235
You know, you were right. I thought we were happy.

655
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,239
We weren't happy.

656
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,204
But with Mindy...

657
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:19,050
...now I'm happy.

658
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,211
Spit. 
What?

659
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,118
Me.

660
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,054
Anyway....

661
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,154
I guess this belongs to you. Or maybe some day Mindy.

662
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:36,063
Like she'd settle for that.

663
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:42,164
Yeah, that's true.

664
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:46,142
But I think it's a nice ring...

665
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:50,181
...and thank you for giving it to me.

666
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,243
Thank you for giving it back.

667
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:57,080
Hello!

668
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:04,121
Please, what's wrong with Helen? 
Helen Geller?

669
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:09,099
I don't think so. 
It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

670
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:12,227
Thank you. 
No, I mean, it's not Geller.

671
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,036
It'll be Helen Willick?

672
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:20,201
No, actually, we talked about Helen Willick Bunch.

673
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,243
Wait a minute. Why is she in the title?

674
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:26,143
It's my baby too.

675
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:29,244
Really? I don't remember you making any sperm.

676
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:35,057
And we all know what a challenge that is.

677
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:39,259
You two, stop it. 
She gets a credit. I'm in there too.

678
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:45,231
Helen Willick Bunch Geller? I think that borders on child abuse.

679
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:49,269
Of course not. I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.

680
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:54,138
See what he does? He knows no one's gonna say all those names.

681
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:57,010
They'll call her Geller. He gets his way.

682
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,108
My way? You think this is my way?

683
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:03,087
Of all the ways I ever imagined this moment being...

684
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:07,023
...this is not my
 You know what? This is too hard.

685
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:10,027
Knock, knock. How are we? Any nausea?

686
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:12,030
A little. 
Just a little.

687
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:18,231
I was wondering about the mother
to
be, but thanks for sharing.

688
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,132
Lie back. 
You know what? I'm gonna go.

689
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:27,008
I don't think I can be involved in this family thing.

690
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,218
Oh, my God! 
Look at that.

691
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:42,124
I know.

692
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:54,330
Well, isn't that amazing?

693
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,169
What are we supposed to be seeing here?

694
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,115
I don't know, but I think it's about to attack the <i>Enterprise.</i>

695
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,190
If you tilt your head and relax your eyes...

696
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:15,222
...it kind of looks like an old potato.

697
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,289
Then don't do that, all right?

698
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,224
Monica, what do you think?

699
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:28,230
Are you welling up? 
No.

700
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:32,102
You are. You're welling up. 
I'm not.

701
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:35,011
You're gonna be an aunt. 
Oh, shut up.

702
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:40,117
Hi, Mindy. Hi, it's Rachel.

703
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:44,121
Yeah, I'm fine. I saw Barry today.

704
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:49,126
Yeah, he told me. No, it's okay. Really, it's okay.

705
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:53,029
I hope you two are very happy. I really do.

706
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:56,966
And, Min, you know, if everything works out...

707
00:23:57,069 --> 00:24:00,971
...and you guys get married and have kids...

708
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:04,065
...I hope they have his hairline and your nose!

709
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:13,074
That was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now!
