1036
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:07,897
If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want world peace no hunger, good things for the rain forest.

1038
01:00:08,909 --> 01:00:10,706
And bigger boobs.

1039
01:00:11,846 --> 01:00:14,815
Well, see, you took mine.

1040
01:00:15,749 --> 01:00:16,738
What about you?

1041
01:00:16,851 --> 01:00:21,811
If I were omnipotent for a day, I'd make myself omnipotent forever.

1042
01:00:21,922 --> 01:00:26,916
There's always one guy. ''If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes.''

1043
01:00:28,863 --> 01:00:29,955
Hey, Joey.

1044
01:00:30,764 --> 01:00:33,028
What would you do if you were omnipotent?

1045
01:00:33,767 --> 01:00:35,758
Probably kill myself.

1046
01:00:36,871 --> 01:00:37,929
Excuse me?

1047
01:00:37,972 --> 01:00:41,874
If little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live.

1048
01:00:43,878 --> 01:00:46,972
Joey, omnipotent.

1049
01:00:47,882 --> 01:00:49,850
You are?

1050
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:55,820
Ross, I'm sorry. I had no idea. I thought it was a theoretical question.

1051
01:00:56,824 --> 01:00:58,883
The One With the George Stephanopoulos

1052
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:47,874
How does she do that?

1053
01:01:47,942 --> 01:01:50,740
I can't sleep in a public place.

1054
01:01:50,844 --> 01:01:52,971
Libraries, airplanes, movie theaters....

1055
01:01:53,781 --> 01:01:55,715
You slept at the Grand Canyon.

1056
01:01:55,783 --> 01:01:59,776
Hello, Mom and Dad never took us to the Grand Canyon.

1057
01:02:00,788 --> 01:02:02,915
Mom and Dad took us to the Grand Canyon?

1058
01:02:04,692 --> 01:02:07,786
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.

1059
01:02:07,861 --> 01:02:08,919
Yeah.

1060
01:02:09,863 --> 01:02:11,831
What? What? What?

1061
01:02:11,899 --> 01:02:15,926
-Hi.
-It's okay. You just nodded off again.

1062
01:02:16,737 --> 01:02:17,726
What's going on?

1063
01:02:17,805 --> 01:02:28,704
I got no sleep last night. My grandmother has a new boyfriend and they're both kind of insecure in bed, so-- And deaf.

1065
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:33,852
They reassure each other that they're having a good time.

1066
01:02:33,921 --> 01:02:37,755
You have no idea how loud they are.

1067
01:02:38,726 --> 01:02:41,820
-You can stay with Rachel and me.
-Thanks.

1068
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:44,921
--95, 96, 97. See, I told you.

1069
01:02:45,733 --> 01:02:48,031
Less than 100 steps from our place to here.

1070
01:02:48,769 --> 01:02:51,761
You got way too much free time, man.

1071
01:02:51,872 --> 01:02:54,739
There's the birthday boy.

1072
01:02:54,842 --> 01:02:58,903
Hockey tickets. Rangers-Penguins tonight and we're taking you.

1073
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,706
-Happy birthday, pal!
-We love you, man.

1074
01:03:03,784 --> 01:03:06,878
It's funny. My birthday was seven months ago.

1075
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:12,984
-So?
-So you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide who got to bring a date?

1077
01:03:13,727 --> 01:03:16,924
Well, aren't we Mr. The-Glass-ls-Half-Empty?

1078
01:03:17,698 --> 01:03:21,691
Oh, my God! Is today the 20th? October 20th?

1079
01:03:21,735 --> 01:03:25,796
-I hoped you wouldn't remember.
-What's wrong with the 20th?

1080
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:30,708
Eleven days before Halloween. All the good costumes are gone?

1081
01:03:30,811 --> 01:03:39,717
Today's the day Carol and I first consummated our physical relationship.

1084
01:03:39,953 --> 01:03:41,921
Sex.

1085
01:03:44,825 --> 01:03:49,728
-You told your sister that?
-Believe me, I told everyone.

1086
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:51,830
I better pass on the game.

1087
01:03:51,932 --> 01:03:56,892
I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.

1088
01:03:57,871 --> 01:04:00,863
The hell with hockey! Let's all do that!

1089
01:04:02,776 --> 01:04:06,678
Come on, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice! Guys' night out!

1090
01:04:06,714 --> 01:04:08,875
Come on, what do you say, big guy?

1091
01:04:08,916 --> 01:04:11,783
-What are you doing?
-I have no idea.

1092
01:04:11,885 --> 01:04:16,686
-Come on, Ross.
-Maybe it will take my mind off it.

1093
01:04:16,724 --> 01:04:19,784
-Promise to buy me a big foam finger?
-You got it.

1094
01:04:19,893 --> 01:04:22,828
Look, look, look! My first paycheck!

1095
01:04:22,896 --> 01:04:27,799
Look at the window! There's my name! Hi, me!

1096
01:04:28,702 --> 01:04:30,829
I remember when I got my first paycheck.

1097
01:04:30,904 --> 01:04:34,931
There was a cave-in in a mine, and eight people were killed.

1098
01:04:36,744 --> 01:04:40,942
-You worked in a mine?
-No, I worked at a Dairy Queen. Why?

1099
01:04:43,951 --> 01:04:49,821
Isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it. I steamed milk.

1100
01:04:49,857 --> 01:04:54,723
And it was totally not worth it.

1102
01:04:54,828 --> 01:04:58,696
What's FICA? Why's he getting all my money?

1103
01:04:59,666 --> 01:05:02,794
I mean, what--? Chandler, look at that.

1104
01:05:03,670 --> 01:05:05,763
This is not that bad.

1105
01:05:05,806 --> 01:05:08,775
You're fine, yeah, for a first job.

1106
01:05:08,809 --> 01:05:11,710
You can totally, totally live on this.

1107
01:05:11,779 --> 01:05:13,872
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1108
01:05:13,914 --> 01:05:17,907
-By the way, great service today.
-Yeah.

1109
01:05:21,789 --> 01:05:23,916
-Hockey!
-Hockey!

1110
01:05:34,902 --> 01:05:37,700
-Hockey!
-Hockey.

1111
01:05:38,906 --> 01:05:40,897
Rachel?

1112
01:05:41,909 --> 01:05:44,707
Oh, my God!

1113
01:05:48,949 --> 01:05:53,716
I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.

1114
01:05:53,754 --> 01:05:54,948
What are you doing here?

1115
01:05:55,689 --> 01:06:00,888
We were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, and it's true!

1116
01:06:02,896 --> 01:06:07,765
Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play.

1117
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:12,864
God, look at you! You're so big! I can't believe it!

1118
01:06:12,973 --> 01:06:16,807
I know, I know! I'm a duplex.

1119
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:22,780
Kiki, you look phenomenal. I mean, you've lost, like, a ton of weight.

1120
01:06:22,883 --> 01:06:28,985
And you should really, really-- It's time to stop, you look perfect.

1122
01:06:29,723 --> 01:06:30,883
What's going on?

1123
01:06:30,924 --> 01:06:34,985
Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm?

1124
01:06:38,699 --> 01:06:40,997
And while we're on the subject of news....

1125
01:06:44,705 --> 01:06:46,900
Look, look! I have elbows!

1126
01:06:51,945 --> 01:06:54,812
--Passes it up to Leetch.

1127
01:06:54,915 --> 01:06:57,884
Leetch spots Messier. Here's the pass!

1128
01:06:59,653 --> 01:07:03,783
We'll take a time-out while Messier looks at some women's shoes.

1129
01:07:03,857 --> 01:07:08,851
Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we first....

1130
01:07:08,896 --> 01:07:11,956
You know? In fact, she....

1131
01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:14,758
She never took them off.

1132
01:07:14,801 --> 01:07:17,895
It's because we-- Sorry, sorry.

1133
01:07:18,705 --> 01:07:21,799
I can't believe--

1134
01:07:22,809 --> 01:07:24,868
-What?
-Peach pit.

1135
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:27,670
Yes, bunny?

1136
01:07:27,881 --> 01:07:31,681
Peach pit. That night, we had--

1137
01:07:31,785 --> 01:07:35,778
-Peaches?
-Actually, nectarines but....

1138
01:07:35,822 --> 01:07:37,687
Could've been a peach.

1139
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:46,928
Then we-- Then we got dressed and I walked her to the bus stop. I'm fine.

1141
01:07:47,935 --> 01:07:50,927
Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's.

1142
01:07:54,942 --> 01:07:58,639
What? I thought we were trying to find stuff.

1143
01:07:58,946 --> 01:08:01,779
Come on, you guys. Tell me all the dirt.

1144
01:08:01,848 --> 01:08:06,842
Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar.

1145
01:08:07,955 --> 01:08:11,857
-Let's talk reality for a second.
-Okay.

1146
01:08:11,892 --> 01:08:16,659
-When are you coming home?
-What? Guys, I'm not.

1147
01:08:16,763 --> 01:08:20,665
-Come on. This is us.
-I'm not.

1148
01:08:20,701 --> 01:08:24,694
This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job.

1149
01:08:24,805 --> 01:08:27,865
I even do my own laundry.

1150
01:08:31,878 --> 01:08:34,938
-This is what I'm doing now.
-Waitressing?

1151
01:08:35,716 --> 01:08:41,712
I'm not just waitressing. I mean, I'm....

1152
01:08:41,788 --> 01:08:47,727
I write the specials on the specials board.

1153
01:08:47,828 --> 01:08:51,821
And I take the dead flowers out of the vase.

1154
01:08:51,898 --> 01:08:56,835
Sometimes Arturo lets me put the chocolate blobbies on the cookies.

1155
01:08:56,870 --> 01:09:01,637
Well, your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.

1156
01:09:11,651 --> 01:09:14,643
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?

1157
01:09:17,758 --> 01:09:20,784
Okay, how would you like some Tiki Death punch?

1158
01:09:20,861 --> 01:09:23,694
-What's that?
-Well, it's rum and--

1159
01:09:23,797 --> 01:09:25,697
Okay.

1160
01:09:27,667 --> 01:09:30,864
Since Phoebe's staying, we'll have a slumber party.

1161
01:09:30,971 --> 01:09:35,704
We got trashy magazines. We got cookie dough. We got Twister.

1162
01:09:36,676 --> 01:09:41,807
And I brought Operation. But I lost the tweezers so we can't operate.

1163
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:44,876
But we can prep the guy.

1164
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:51,723
-Rach, it's the Visa card people.
-Oh, God. Ask them what they want.

1165
01:09:51,792 --> 01:09:55,694
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to?

1166
01:09:55,929 --> 01:09:59,797
There's been unusual activity on your account.

1167
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:01,925
I haven't used my card in weeks.

1168
01:10:02,736 --> 01:10:04,897
That is the unusual activity.

1169
01:10:05,939 --> 01:10:08,806
They wanna see if you're okay.

1170
01:10:08,842 --> 01:10:12,835
They wanna know if I'm okay? Okay, let's see.

1171
01:10:12,913 --> 01:10:16,849
Well, let's see. The FICA guys took all my money.

1172
01:10:16,917 --> 01:10:20,819
Everyone is getting married or pregnant or promoted.

1173
01:10:20,854 --> 01:10:24,915
And I'm getting coffee. And it's not even for me!

1174
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:29,759
If that sounds like I'm okay, then tell them I'm okay. Okay?

1175
01:10:31,731 --> 01:10:36,828
Rachel has left the building. Can you call back?

1176
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:39,771
All right! Come on!

1177
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:42,841
Let's play Twister!

1178
01:10:50,851 --> 01:10:55,788
-Sorry.
-Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

1179
01:10:55,822 --> 01:10:59,781
There was ice that night with Carol? Plastic seats?

1180
01:10:59,826 --> 01:11:02,818
Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?

1181
01:11:03,797 --> 01:11:06,925
No, I was just saying we're not sitting together.

1182
01:11:07,734 --> 01:11:10,999
But now that you mention it, there was ice that night.

1183
01:11:11,805 --> 01:11:14,797
It was the first frost.

1184
01:11:14,841 --> 01:11:16,934
Sit. Just sit down. Sit.

1185
01:11:17,711 --> 01:11:20,839
You're doing this amazing independent thing.

1186
01:11:20,947 --> 01:11:23,711
Monica, what is so amazing?

1187
01:11:23,817 --> 01:11:27,844
I gave up, like, everything. And for what?

1188
01:11:27,921 --> 01:11:31,755
-You are just like Jack.
-Jack from downstairs?

1189
01:11:32,025 --> 01:11:34,960
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.

1190
01:11:35,829 --> 01:11:37,729
Ah, the other Jack.

1191
01:11:37,764 --> 01:11:41,928
Right. He gave up something but then he got those magic beans.

1192
01:11:41,968 --> 01:11:49,968
And then he woke up and there was this big plant outside of his window, full of possibilities.

1194
01:11:50,777 --> 01:11:53,871
He lived in a village, and you live in the Village.

1195
01:11:53,947 --> 01:12:00,682
Okay. But, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow. I gave up an orthodontist.

1196
01:12:00,787 --> 01:12:05,815
-Okay, I know I didn't love him....
-Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.

1197
01:12:06,693 --> 01:12:09,685
But, see, it was a plan. It was clear.

1198
01:12:09,796 --> 01:12:12,731
Everything was figured out. Now it's like....

1199
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,790
-Floopy?
-Yeah.

1200
01:12:15,936 --> 01:12:19,702
We don't know where we're going.

1201
01:12:19,739 --> 01:12:24,836
It's all gonna come together and it's just gonna be un-floopy.

1202
01:12:24,945 --> 01:12:27,709
Yeah, like that's a word.

1203
01:12:29,916 --> 01:12:34,717
Okay. But Monica, what if it doesn't come together?

1204
01:12:35,755 --> 01:12:36,949
Pheebs?

1205
01:12:37,958 --> 01:12:41,917
Well, because you just-- I don't like this question.

1206
01:12:42,829 --> 01:12:46,731
See, you guys? What if we don't get magic beans?

1207
01:12:46,833 --> 01:12:51,736
I mean, what if all we've got are beans?

1208
01:12:54,841 --> 01:12:57,867
Get him! Get him! Get him!

1209
01:12:57,978 --> 01:13:00,879
Yes! You're not laughing now, are you, pal?

1210
01:13:01,681 --> 01:13:05,674
All you needed were guys hitting each other with sticks.

1211
01:13:05,719 --> 01:13:07,812
Pass it! Pass it!

1212
01:13:07,887 --> 01:13:12,790
-He's open! He's open!
-Shoot it! Shoot it!

1213
01:13:17,797 --> 01:13:20,698
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing.

1214
01:13:31,711 --> 01:13:32,837
Excuse me?

1215
01:13:32,912 --> 01:13:37,713
It says to call if you're not satisfied with this candy bar.

1216
01:13:37,751 --> 01:13:40,811
Well, I'm not completely satisfied.

1217
01:13:42,756 --> 01:13:45,748
Well, the label promises nutty goodness.

1218
01:13:46,726 --> 01:13:50,958
It's an emergency. But you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.

1219
01:13:53,767 --> 01:13:56,759
Hold on. Fill these out. Sit over there!

1220
01:13:56,870 --> 01:14:00,863
I don't want to make any trouble but I'm in a lot of pain.

1221
01:14:00,974 --> 01:14:05,707
-My face is dented.
-Well, you'll have to wait your turn.

1222
01:14:05,779 --> 01:14:10,773
-How long do you think it will be?
-Any minute now.

1223
01:14:12,886 --> 01:14:14,877
Hey, this--

1224
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:31,701
I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.

1225
01:14:31,738 --> 01:14:36,835
No, you were right. I don't have a plan.

1226
01:14:38,912 --> 01:14:42,712
-Pizza guy.
-Food!

1227
01:14:42,749 --> 01:14:44,808
-Phoebe?
-What?

1228
01:14:44,851 --> 01:14:48,912
-Do you have a plan?
-I don't even have a ''pla.''

1229
01:14:51,758 --> 01:14:53,919
One mushroom, green pepper and onion?

1230
01:14:54,728 --> 01:14:57,856
No, no, no. That's not what we ordered!

1231
01:14:58,665 --> 01:15:01,964
We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese!

1232
01:15:04,871 --> 01:15:09,672
Wait. You're not G. Stephanopoulos? Man, my dad's gonna kill me!

1233
01:15:09,776 --> 01:15:13,803
Wait! Did you say G. Stephanopoulos?

1234
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:18,874
Yeah, this one goes across the street. I gave him yours. Bonehead! Bonehead!

1235
01:15:19,686 --> 01:15:22,883
When you do that, you're only hitting yourself.

1236
01:15:24,924 --> 01:15:30,885
Was this a small Mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?

1237
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:34,923
-That sounds right.
-Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?

1238
01:15:35,735 --> 01:15:39,000
-And a power tie?
-No, pretty much just a towel.

1239
01:15:39,739 --> 01:15:43,732
-Oh, God!
-You guys want me to take this back?

1240
01:15:43,843 --> 01:15:48,746
What, are you nuts? We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!

1241
01:15:51,951 --> 01:15:56,752
Pheebs, who's George Snuffleupagus?

1242
01:15:58,691 --> 01:16:00,852
That's Big Bird's friend.

1243
01:16:02,796 --> 01:16:05,890
-I see pizza!
-I want to see. Let me see.

1244
01:16:06,666 --> 01:16:08,657
Hello! Who are we spying on?

1245
01:16:08,768 --> 01:16:11,760
White House adviser, Clinton's campaign guy.

1246
01:16:11,871 --> 01:16:15,671
The one with the great hair, sexy smile, cute butt.

1247
01:16:15,775 --> 01:16:19,711
Oh, him! The little guy. Oh, I love him!

1248
01:16:19,813 --> 01:16:24,978
-Wait. Wait, I see a woman.
-Tell me it's his mother.

1249
01:16:25,718 --> 01:16:27,913
-Definitely not his mother.
-Oh, no!

1250
01:16:28,688 --> 01:16:32,886
Wait, she's walking across the floor. She's walking, she's walking....

1251
01:16:32,926 --> 01:16:36,885
She's going for the pizza-- That's not for you, bitch!

1252
01:16:51,911 --> 01:16:56,780
We've been here for over an hour, and people less sick have gone in.

1253
01:16:56,883 --> 01:17:00,751
That guy with the toe thing, who's he sleeping with?

1254
01:17:03,690 --> 01:17:06,659
Oh, come on, Dora. Don't be mad.

1255
01:17:06,726 --> 01:17:14,861
I know we both said some things...we didn't mean but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.

1257
01:17:15,668 --> 01:17:18,796
You know, I feel like I've lost her.

1258
01:17:22,675 --> 01:17:24,666
-Come on, push me.
-No.

1259
01:17:24,744 --> 01:17:26,905
-Push me.
-We're gonna get in trouble.

1260
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:29,773
Don't be a baby. Push me. Push me.

1261
01:17:29,883 --> 01:17:35,685
All right. I'm gonna push you, okay? How about I push you like this?

1262
01:17:36,923 --> 01:17:42,884
Now you're gonna be in a wheelchair the rest of your life, pally-wally....

1263
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:50,701
I am so very sorry. Can I sign you?

1264
01:17:52,839 --> 01:17:54,807
-Lights still out?
-Yeah.

1265
01:17:54,908 --> 01:17:57,775
Well, maybe they're napping.

1266
01:17:57,844 --> 01:18:02,679
-Please. They're having sex.
-Shut up!

1267
01:18:05,652 --> 01:18:09,850
So, what do you think George is like?

1268
01:18:09,889 --> 01:18:12,687
-I think he's shy.
-Yeah.

1269
01:18:12,759 --> 01:18:15,751
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out.

1270
01:18:15,795 --> 01:18:20,789
And then when you do, he's a preppy animal.

1271
01:18:21,801 --> 01:18:24,770
-What do you think of the guys?
-Our guys?

1272
01:18:24,871 --> 01:18:28,671
-Yeah, our guys.
-I feel funny talking about that.

1273
01:18:28,775 --> 01:18:31,801
-Oh, come on.
-Okay. Well....

1274
01:18:31,878 --> 01:18:34,779
I think Joey's like a little kiddie ride.

1275
01:18:34,881 --> 01:18:38,977
You just have to put the quarter in and it just goes.

1276
01:18:40,787 --> 01:18:47,792
He might surprise you. One time, he helped me put on my coat and he was really tender.

1278
01:18:47,894 --> 01:18:52,695
Come on, baby, come on. Let's go.

1279
01:18:52,799 --> 01:18:54,733
Yes!

1280
01:18:55,735 --> 01:19:00,638
Chandler's one of those repressed guys who you'd have to seduce.

1281
01:19:00,673 --> 01:19:05,633
I think it's an act. Chandler is more sophisticated than he seems.

1282
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:12,945
-You know who's kind of sexy?
-Don't.

1283
01:19:13,686 --> 01:19:16,849
-Ross.
-No, guys. Please, he is my brother.

1284
01:19:16,889 --> 01:19:20,791
I know exactly what you mean. He can be really smooth.

1285
01:19:31,904 --> 01:19:34,805
Can't you just picture him in bed?

1286
01:19:34,874 --> 01:19:36,967
I really don't want to.

1287
01:19:38,778 --> 01:19:40,712
Come on, laugh. Laugh.

1288
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:47,816
I remember the moonlight coming in the window, and her face had the most incredible glow.

1290
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:51,879
The moon, the glow, the magical feeling. You did this.

1291
01:19:52,692 --> 01:19:55,786
Could I get some painkillers over here, please?

1292
01:19:55,895 --> 01:19:59,831
He's right. Enough. What's the big deal about today?

1293
01:19:59,899 --> 01:20:02,834
So you slept with her for the first time.

1294
01:20:02,902 --> 01:20:05,928
You slept with her for seven years after that.

1295
01:20:06,839 --> 01:20:08,932
It's a little more complicated--

1296
01:20:09,742 --> 01:20:13,940
What is it, that she left you for another woman that likes women?

1297
01:20:14,714 --> 01:20:19,845
Louder. There's a man on the 1 2th floor in a coma who didn't hear you.

1298
01:20:22,722 --> 01:20:23,746
Then, what?

1299
01:20:24,824 --> 01:20:29,921
My first time with Carol was was my....

1301
01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:31,954
What?

1302
01:20:34,834 --> 01:20:39,828
It was my first time.

1303
01:20:39,972 --> 01:20:41,940
With Carol?

1304
01:20:46,846 --> 01:20:47,938
Oh.

1305
01:20:48,881 --> 01:20:52,749
So, in your whole life, you've only been with one--?

1306
01:20:53,953 --> 01:20:57,821
Oh, boy. Hockey was a big mistake.

1307
01:20:58,691 --> 01:21:01,819
There's a bunch of stuff we could've done tonight.

1308
01:21:03,730 --> 01:21:05,789
Okay, I got one.

1309
01:21:05,898 --> 01:21:12,694
Do you remember that vegetarian pâté that I made that you loved so much?

1311
01:21:13,706 --> 01:21:16,937
Well, unless goose is a vegetable--!

1312
01:21:19,912 --> 01:21:23,939
Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.

1313
01:21:24,751 --> 01:21:28,710
-What? You slept with Jason?
-You had already broken up.

1314
01:21:28,821 --> 01:21:30,914
-How long?
-Just a couple hours.

1315
01:21:31,724 --> 01:21:35,922
-Oh, that's nice!
-Okay, okay, okay, I got one!

1316
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:42,924
Anyway, the valentine Tom left in your locker was really from me!

1317
01:21:43,836 --> 01:21:45,770
Excuse me?

1318
01:21:45,838 --> 01:21:49,968
Hello! Like he was really gonna send you one.

1319
01:21:51,744 --> 01:21:54,838
She was a big girl!

1320
01:21:55,715 --> 01:22:01,711
Really? Well, at least big girls don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!

1321
01:22:01,821 --> 01:22:04,790
I was laughing. You made me laugh!

1322
01:22:04,824 --> 01:22:07,691
Oh, my God! There he is! There he is!

1323
01:22:07,794 --> 01:22:10,888
-Where?
-Where we've been looking all night.

1324
01:22:11,697 --> 01:22:14,689
-He's so cute.
-George, baby, drop the towel.

1325
01:22:14,801 --> 01:22:18,897
-Come on, drop the towel.
-Drop it. Will you please drop it?

1326
01:22:19,005 --> 01:22:21,701
Wow!

1327
01:22:23,943 --> 01:22:28,937
Man, can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?

1328
01:22:29,916 --> 01:22:33,909
I think it's great. You know, it's sweet.

1329
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:36,011
It's romantic.

1330
01:22:36,923 --> 01:22:37,947
Really?

1331
01:22:38,724 --> 01:22:41,818
You kidding? The guy's a freak. I judge him.

1332
01:22:41,861 --> 01:22:43,829
-Hey, man!
-Hey, buddy!

1333
01:22:47,767 --> 01:22:51,760
Oh, that's attractive.

1334
01:22:52,872 --> 01:22:56,672
I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs.

1335
01:22:57,910 --> 01:23:01,778
Admit it, all things considered, you had fun tonight.

1336
01:23:01,881 --> 01:23:05,715
Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me which part was fun.

1337
01:23:05,818 --> 01:23:06,910
Where's my puck?

1338
01:23:07,687 --> 01:23:10,679
-The kid has it.
-The kid--

1339
01:23:11,691 --> 01:23:13,886
Excuse me, that's my puck.

1340
01:23:14,694 --> 01:23:18,790
I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.

1341
01:23:21,701 --> 01:23:22,998
You gotta do it, man.

1342
01:23:24,003 --> 01:23:26,938
I'm rubber, you're glue. Whatever you--

1343
01:23:27,707 --> 01:23:28,935
I can't do it.

1344
01:23:29,742 --> 01:23:31,937
-Listen, give me back my puck.
-No.

1345
01:23:32,712 --> 01:23:33,906
-Yes, how about--?
-No.

1346
01:23:33,946 --> 01:23:35,914
-Give me my puck.
-No.

1347
01:23:35,948 --> 01:23:37,916
No roughhousing in my ER!

1348
01:23:38,718 --> 01:23:40,845
Give me my puck!

1349
01:23:45,725 --> 01:23:47,920
Now that was fun.

1350
01:23:53,766 --> 01:23:57,862
Okay, Monica. Right foot, red.

1351
01:23:57,904 --> 01:24:01,863
We could've played Monopoly, but no!

1352
01:24:07,813 --> 01:24:09,713
Thanks.

1353
01:24:14,921 --> 01:24:19,722
Okay, Pheebs. Right hand, blue.

1354
01:24:26,732 --> 01:24:30,725
Ross, switch with me and Phoebe could be number two.

1355
01:24:31,938 --> 01:24:36,898
Nothing. It's a Twister thing. The rules are on the back of the box.

1356
01:24:39,745 --> 01:24:40,939
Hello?

1357
01:24:41,747 --> 01:24:43,715
It's the Visa card people.

1358
01:24:43,816 --> 01:24:47,752
-Okay. Will you take my place?
-All right. This is Rachel.

1359
01:24:47,853 --> 01:24:49,753
No!

1360
01:24:51,824 --> 01:24:56,852
Hello? Oh, yeah. No, I know. I haven't been using it much.

1361
01:24:56,896 --> 01:25:00,662
Oh, well, thanks. But I'm okay, really.

1362
01:25:00,766 --> 01:25:02,859
-To the green.
-Oh, no.

1363
01:25:02,969 --> 01:25:05,870
I've got magic beans.

1364
01:25:07,907 --> 01:25:09,807
No, no, never mind.

1365
01:25:09,875 --> 01:25:12,776
To the left! To the left!

1366
01:25:12,878 --> 01:25:15,870
I'm fine.
