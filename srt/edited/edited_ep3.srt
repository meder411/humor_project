711
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,059
-How did it go?
-Not so good.

712
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:05,195
He walked me home and said, ''Let's do this again.''

713
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:09,176
He said, ''Let's do this again.'' That's good, right?

714
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:15,005
Translated, ''Let's do this again'' means, ''You'll never see me naked.''

715
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,175
Since when?

716
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,078
Since always. It's, like, dating language.

717
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:24,182
Like, ''It's not you'' means, ''It is you.''

718
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:32,022
''You're nice'' means, ''I'll be dating alcoholics and complaining about them to you.''

720
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,127
''We should see other people'' means:

721
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:37,101
''Ha-ha, I already am!''

722
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,098
Everybody knows this?

723
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,132
Cushions the blow.

724
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:47,138
Like your parents putting the dog to sleep and saying it went to a farm.

726
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:54,178
That's funny. Because our parents actually did send our dog off to live on a farm.

728
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:56,149
Ross?

729
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:00,187
Hello! The Milner's farm in Connecticut?

730
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:03,088
The Milners had this unbelievable farm.

731
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:05,997
They had horses and rabbits to chase.

732
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,192
And it was....

733
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:12,996
Oh, my God! Chi-Chi!

734
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:18,078
The One With the Thumb

735
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,995
How does it feel knowing you're about to die?

736
00:02:09,063 --> 00:02:12,157
Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over.

737
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:17,165
But you'll live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.

738
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,998
That was really good!

739
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:22,975
Thanks. Let's keep going.

740
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:27,013
So, what do you want from me, Dimon? Huh?

741
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:33,176
I just wanna go back to my cell, because in my cell I can smoke.

742
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,979
Smoke away!

743
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:52,102
I think this is why Dimon smokes in his cell alone.

744
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,065
-What?
-Relax your hand.

745
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:57,076
Let your wrist go.

746
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:59,044
Not so much!

747
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:02,945
All right. Now take a puff.

748
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,948
Right.

749
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:10,047
-Give it to me.
-I'm not giving you a cigarette.

750
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,049
It's fine. Do you want to get this part or not? Here.

751
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:17,153
Now, don't think of it as a cigarette.

752
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:21,998
Think of it as the thing that has been missing from your hand.

753
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,194
When you hold it, you feel right.

754
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:26,061
You feel complete.

755
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:29,169
-You miss it?
-No, not so much.

756
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:33,970
All right. Now we smoke.

757
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:39,008
Oh, my God!

758
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,087
-Give me that!
-No. You've got options.

759
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:43,019
You can smoke like this:

760
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,183
-Chandler--
-Or hold it in your mouth.

761
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,022
Give me the cigarette!

762
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:48,287
-You try.
-Thank you.

763
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:51,088
Okay, how's this?

764
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,959
Okay, that's not bad.

765
00:03:56,036 --> 00:04:00,063
All right, when you're finished, it's cool if you flick it.

766
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:08,046
All right, you keep practicing and I'll go put out the sofa.

768
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:14,077
I thought it was foot size.

769
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:21,093
No. It's the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.

771
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,157
That's ridiculous.

772
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,063
Can I use either thumb?

773
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:35,066
I'd rather go with the foot theory.

774
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:38,167
All right. Don't tell me.

775
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:42,173
Decaf cappuccino for Joey.

776
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:45,986
Coffee, black.

777
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,984
Latte.

778
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:51,116
And an iced tea.

779
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:54,961
-I'm getting good at this.
-Excellent!

780
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:56,121
Good for me!

781
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:12,977
-You okay, Phoebe?
-It's not worth--

782
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,240
It's my bank.

783
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,041
-What did they do?
-It's nothing--

784
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:20,985
I get my mail and open their monthly ''statement.''

785
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:22,988
Easy!

786
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:27,159
And there's $500 extra in my account.

787
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:31,088
Satan's minions at work again!

788
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:34,065
Now I have to go deal with them--

789
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:38,060
-What are you talking about? Keep it!
-It's not mine.

790
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,106
If I kept it, I'd be stealing.

791
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:44,008
But if you spent it, it would be like shopping.

792
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,207
Say I bought a great pair of shoes.

793
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:53,919
Know what I'd hear with every step? ''Not mine. Not mine. Not mine.''

794
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:57,047
Even if I was happy and skipping, I'd hear:

795
00:05:57,124 --> 00:06:00,059
''Not-not mine. Not-not mine.''

796
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,027
We're with you. We got it.

797
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,123
I'd never be able to enjoy it. It'd be this giant karmic debt.

798
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,158
Chandler, what are you doing?

799
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,061
What are you doing?

800
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:17,075
Oh, gross!

801
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:20,044
-What is this?
-I'm smoking!

802
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:22,945
You've been so good for three years!

803
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,042
And this is my reward.

804
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:30,046
Think about what you went through when you quit.

805
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:33,991
Forget about you. Think about what we went through!

806
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,154
So this time I won't quit.

807
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:39,063
-Put it out!
-I'm putting it out!

808
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,259
Oh, no!

809
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,095
I can't drink this now.

810
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,099
I'm gonna go. I've got a date.

811
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,940
With Alan again? How's it going?

812
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:57,039
It's going pretty good. It's nice and we're having fun.

813
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:59,119
When do we get to meet him?

814
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:01,121
Let's see, it's Monday....

815
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:03,052
-Never.
-Come on!

816
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:05,148
Not after what happened with Steve.

817
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:10,123
What do you mean? We love Steve. Steve was sexy!

818
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,122
Sorry.

819
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:17,226
I don't know how I feel yet. Let me figure it out.

820
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:19,939
Then can we meet him?

821
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:20,962
No.

822
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,941
Sorry.

823
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:28,138
Joey. Let it go.

824
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,144
Why should they meet him?

825
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:40,151
I bring a guy home and they're like coyotes picking off the weak members of the herd.

827
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:49,197
Listen, as someone who's seen more than her share of bad beef I'll tell you, that is not such a terrible thing.

829
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,097
Your friends are just looking after you.

830
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:55,903
I wish that once I'd date a guy they liked.

831
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:59,137
You realize the odds of that happening are slimmer...

832
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:03,110
-...if they never get to meet the guy.
-I know.

833
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,950
-Can't I whimper a little bit?
-Whimper.

834
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,219
Okay, I'm done.

835
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,049
Let it go, Ross.

836
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,927
You didn't know Chi-Chi.

837
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,231
-Do you all promise?
-We promise.

838
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,959
We'll be good.

839
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:27,131
Chandler, do you promise to be good?

840
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:39,044
You can come in, but your filter-tip buddy stays outside!

841
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:51,959
''Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling.

842
00:08:52,065 --> 00:09:04,906
We've credited you $500. We're sorry for the inconvenience and hope you'll accept this football phone as our gift.'' Do you believe it?

845
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:08,005
Now I have $1000 and a football phone.

846
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,908
What bank is this?

847
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,113
Okay, it's him.

848
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:17,947
-Who is it?
-Alan.

849
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,925
Chandler! He's here!

850
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:23,952
Do I look okay?

851
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,023
One more button.

852
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:28,067
Closed! How about closed?

853
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:31,070
-I didn't know.
-Yeah.

854
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,139
Please be good.

855
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:37,143
Remember how much you all like me?

856
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:43,143
Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.

857
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,181
I've heard so much about all you guys.

858
00:09:57,164 --> 00:10:00,065
I'll call you tomorrow. Thanks.

859
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:07,064
Let's let the Alan-bashing begin.

860
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:10,007
Who's gonna take the first shot?

861
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:12,102
Come on!

862
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,081
I'll go.

863
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,210
Let's start with how he kept picking--

864
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,080
I'm sorry, I can't do this. We loved him.

865
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,124
We loved him!

866
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:29,094
Wait! We're talking about someone I'm going out with?

867
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:30,993
That pimento trick!

868
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:34,124
I'll never look at an olive the same way again.

869
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,099
And did you notice?

870
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:44,110
Know what was great? His smile was crooked.

871
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:48,204
-Yes! Like the man in the shoe!
-What shoe?

872
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,108
From the rhyme.

873
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:53,083
There was a man With a crooked smile

874
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,987
Who lived in a shoe For a while

875
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:06,056
So I think Alan is the yardstick by which future boyfriends will be measured.

877
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,155
Future boyfriends?

878
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:11,062
-I think this could be ''it.''
-Really?

879
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:15,063
I'd marry him for his David Hasselhoff impression alone.

880
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:18,077
You know I'll be doing that at parties.

881
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:24,109
-Know what I like most?
-What?

882
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:28,179
The way he makes me feel about myself.

883
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,234
How was the game?

884
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,071
Well....

885
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:57,048
We won!

886
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,953
Fantastic! Question. How is that possible?

887
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:04,048
-Alan.
-He was unbelievable!

888
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,992
Like the cartoon where Bugs Bunny plays every position.

889
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:12,157
It was first base, Alan. Second base, Alan....

890
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,199
It was like he made us into a team.

891
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:23,966
We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers a thing or two about softball.

892
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,273
Can I ask a question?

893
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,106
Do you think Alan is sometimes....

894
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,171
What?

895
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:33,116
I don't know. A little too ''Alan''?

896
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:37,088
Oh, no. Not possible. You can never be too ''Alan.''

897
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:42,083
It's his innate ''Alan-ness'' that we adore.

898
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:45,120
I, personally, could have a gallon of Alan.

899
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:55,066
-Hey, Lizzy.
-Hey, weird girl.

900
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:58,135
-I brought alphabet soup.
-Pick out the vowels?

901
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,937
I left in the Y's. Because, ''sometimes Y.''

902
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:05,142
-And something else.
-Saltines?

903
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:07,982
No, $1000 and a football phone.

904
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:09,979
What?

905
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,183
Oh, my God!

906
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:15,188
-There's really money in here.
-I know.

907
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,156
What are you doing?

908
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,092
I want you to have it. I don't want it.

909
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:24,193
-I have to give you something.
-No, you don't--

910
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:28,168
-Do you want my tinfoil hat?
-No, you need that.

911
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:31,176
-It's okay. Thanks.
-Let me do something.

912
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:37,006
I'll tell you what. Buy me a soda and we're even. Okay?

913
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,212
-Okay.
-Okay.

914
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,072
Keep the change.

915
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,105
Thanks, Lizzy.

916
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:45,208
Want a pretzel?

917
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,988
-No, I'm fine. Thanks.
-See you.

918
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:59,022
A thumb?

919
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:07,036
I know. There it was, just floating like this tiny little hitchhiker.

921
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:12,034
Maybe it's a contest. Like ''collect all five.''

922
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,048
-Does anyone wanna see?
-No, thanks!

923
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,177
Don't do that. Come on!

924
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:22,148
It's worse than the thumb.

925
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:26,152
-This is so unfair.
-Why is it unfair?

926
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,155
So I have a flaw! Big deal!

927
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:32,158
Joey's knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?

928
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:34,962
Ross, over-pronouncing every word.

929
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:40,200
Monica, who snorts when she laughs. I mean, what the hell is that thing?

930
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:46,008
I accept those flaws. Why can't you accept me for this?

931
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:56,044
Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody, or just him?

932
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,959
I could live without it.

933
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:08,958
Is it a little annoying? Or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?

934
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,129
Don't listen to him. I think it's endearing.

935
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:16,966
Oh, you do, do you?

936
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:26,075
There's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.

937
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:29,085
Indeed there isn't.

938
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,057
I should get back to work.

939
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:37,061
Otherwise someone might get what they ordered.

940
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:43,092
The hair comes out and the gloves come off.

941
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:01,109
Ever go out with a guy your friends really like?

942
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:03,054
No.

943
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:08,956
I'm going out with a guy my friends really like.

944
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,020
Are we talking about the coyotes here?

945
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:16,034
All right! A cow got through.

946
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,028
Can you believe it?

947
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:20,003
It's just, you know what?

948
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:23,008
I just don't feel the ''thing.''

949
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:25,943
They feel the thing. I don't feel it.

950
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:30,982
Honey, you should always feel the thing.

951
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:36,986
If that's how you feel about the guy, dump him.

952
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:40,184
-It's gonna be really hard.
-He'll get over it.

953
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,954
No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.

954
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:50,058
-Don't you respect your body?
-Don't you see what you're doing?

955
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:54,038
I've had it with your cancer, emphysema and heart disease.

956
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:58,901
The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.

957
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:04,049
Alan wants to speak to you.

958
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,142
Really? He does?

959
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:10,054
Hey, buddy! What's up?

960
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,916
She told you about that, huh?

961
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,927
Well, yeah. I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now.

962
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,161
It's not that--

963
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,137
Well, that's true.

964
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:31,968
Gee, you know, no one's ever put it like that before.

965
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:34,945
Well, okay. Thanks.

966
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,954
God, he's good.

967
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,062
-If only he were a woman.
-Yeah.

968
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:57,091
Lamb Chop!

969
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:00,930
How old is that sock?

970
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,101
If I had a sock on my hand for 30 years, it'd be talking too.

971
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:11,948
I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.

972
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:20,148
-Where's Joey?
-Joey ate my last stick of gum so I killed him.

974
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:23,052
Do you think that was wrong?

975
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:27,126
-I think he's across the hall.
-Thanks.

976
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,025
There you go.

977
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:33,128
I'm alive with pleasure now.

978
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,074
Pheebs, do you want the rest of that Pop-Tart?

979
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,146
Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?

980
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,950
Hey, I might.

981
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:47,042
I'm sorry.

982
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:51,954
The soda people gave me $ 7000 for the thumb.

983
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:56,152
And on my way over here I stepped in gum.

984
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,088
What is up with the universe?

985
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:03,191
-What's going on?
-It's just nice when we're together.

986
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:07,097
It's nicer when everyone gets to wear underwear.

987
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,980
Please, guys, we have to talk.

988
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,283
Wait! I'm getting a déjà vu.

989
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,080
No, I'm not.

990
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:29,985
-We have to talk.
-There it is!

991
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:34,132
Okay, it's about Alan.

992
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,035
Speaking of which, tell him we're on for the Renaissance Fair.

993
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:43,199
Before you get into that, there's something you should know.

994
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:48,046
There's really no easy way to say this.

995
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:52,208
I've decided to break up with Alan.

996
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:58,956
Is there somebody else?

997
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:05,260
No, it's just you know, things change. People change.

999
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:08,092
We didn't change.

1000
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:13,195
So that's it? It's over?

1001
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:16,064
Just like that?

1002
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:22,173
You let your guard down. You start to care about someone, and....

1003
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:27,982
-I can go on pretending--
-Okay!

1004
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:29,079
No.

1005
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:32,182
That wouldn't be fair to me, Alan, or to you.

1006
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:34,216
Well, who wants fair?

1007
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:39,021
I just want things back, you know, the way they were.

1008
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:45,095
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, she's sorry. I feel better.

1009
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:48,036
I can't believe this!

1010
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:53,044
With the holidays coming up. I wanted him to meet my family.

1011
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:56,982
I'll meet someone. There'll be other Alans.

1012
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,074
Yeah, right!

1013
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:06,958
-Are you guys gonna be okay?
-We'll be fine.

1014
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,154
We're just gonna need a little time.

1015
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,188
I understand.

1016
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,968
-Wow.
-I'm really sorry.

1017
00:22:20,073 --> 00:22:23,065
Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry too.

1018
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:26,202
-But I'm a little relieved.
-Relieved?

1019
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:30,176
Yeah, well, I mean, I had a great time with you.

1020
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:34,019
I just can't stand your friends.

1021
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:43,223
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?

1022
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:47,190
That was fun.

1023
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:51,193
He could row like a Viking.

1024
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:02,039
So how'd it go?

1025
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:04,148
You know.

1026
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:06,981
Did he mention us?

1027
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:14,049
He says he's really gonna miss you guys.

1028
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,999
-Rough day, huh?
-You have no idea.

1029
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:25,060
Come here.

1030
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:30,201
-That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
-No!

1031
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:33,070
I don't care! I'm weak!

1032
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:35,080
I've gotta have the smoke!

1033
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:39,083
If you never smoke again, I'll give you $ 7000.

1034
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:41,086
Yeah, all right.
