Joey:  How do I look?
Chandler: Oh, uh, I... don't... care.  Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
Lorraine: Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.
Chandler: ...And what did you bring?
Lorraine: She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.
Chandler: Janice?
Janice: Oh.... my.... God.
Chandler:  Hey, it's Janice.
