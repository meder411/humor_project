[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, time lapse.]

**Ross:** (Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel) I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.

**Rachel:** ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.

**End**
