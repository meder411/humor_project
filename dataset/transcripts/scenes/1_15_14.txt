[Scene: Phoebe's massage parlour, she has Steve on the table, and is giving
him an extra-painful massage.]

**Phoebe:** How's this? (presses down hard)

**Steve:** Eeeee!

**Phoebe:** Sorry. How about over here? (presses down hard again)

**Steve:** Aaaaah!

**Phoebe:** See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt? (presses down elsewhere)

**Steve:** No.

**Phoebe:** What about this? (she starts using her elbows on his back, he yells in pain)

**Steve:** Aaaaahhh!!

**Phoebe:** There you go! (She continues to work him over with her elbows and he continues to yell in pain.)

**End**
