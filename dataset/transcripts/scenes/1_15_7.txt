Joey:  Vulva?
Ross: Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
Joey:  Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
Ross: Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
Joey: What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
Ross:  Please be kidding.
Joey: Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
Ross: OK.  I'm in my apartment...
Joey: ....yeah... what else?
Ross: That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation.
Joey:  Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
Ross: Joey, please.
Joey: Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look!  Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
Ross:  Wow.
Joey: Alright, now you say something.
Ross: I... ahem... I really don't think so.
Joey: Come on! You like this woman, right?
Ross: Yeah.
Joey: You want to see her again, right?
Ross: Sure.
Joey: Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
Ross: OK, turn around.  I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
Joey:  Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
Ross: Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
Joey: There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
Ross: I, er...
Ross: I want to take my tongue... and...
Ross: ....and....
Joey: Say it... say it!
Ross: ...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
Chandler: ....with??
Ross:  Funny story!
Joey: You're not going to believe this!
Chandler: It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
Joey: Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
Chandler: Again?
Joey: And again, and again, and again...  Hello?  And again.
Chandler:  Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor?  Yeah, I miss you too.  Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know?  Well, that's very generous  er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about....  And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier?  Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection!  No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy!  I'll see you on Monday!
