Monica:  OK, try this salmon mousse.
Joey:  Mmmm. Good.
Monica: Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
Joey: It's creamier.
Monica: Yeah, well, is that better?
Joey: I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
Rachel: My God! What happened to you?
Chandler: Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?  "You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."
Phoebe: That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
Chandler: Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
Rachel:  Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
Monica:  Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
Chandler: Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
Monica: It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an _amouz-bouche._
Chandler:  Well.... it is amouz-ing...
Monica:  Hello?  Oh, hi Wendy!  Yeah, eight o'clock.  What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?...  OK, great.  All right, I'll see you then. Bye.
Phoebe: Ten dollars an hour for what?
Monica: Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
Rachel:  Waitressing?
Joey: Uh-oh.
Monica: Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
Rachel: But, but?
Monica: But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
Rachel: Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
Chandler: You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76.  _Amouz-bouche_?
