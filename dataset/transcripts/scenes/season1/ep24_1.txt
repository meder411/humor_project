Joey: Oh, OK.
Phoebe: So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your  special someone?
Joey: I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great.
Monica: Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
Joey: What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?
Monica: Man's got a point.
Joey: Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me.
Chandler: Crazy bitch.
Joey: Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean.
Monica: Joey... we always know what you mean.
Phoebe: Hey.
Monica: Hey.

Phoebe: How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
Ross: I'm going to China.
Phoebe: Jeez, you say one thing, and...
Monica: You're going to China?
Ross: Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary . Um... here's a picture of me...
Phoebe: Oh, let me see!

Monica: Yeah.
Phoebe: Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh....  Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun.
Ross: Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left.

Ross: Hi.
Joey: Hey!
Chandler: Hey!
Ross: ....I have to go to China.
Joey: The country?
Ross: No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?
Chandler: Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no.
Ross: Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.
Joey: Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
Chandler: Forget about her.
Joey: He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.
Chandler: Course there, they just call it food.
Ross: Yeah... I guess. I don'tI don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK?
Joey: Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you.
Ross: I know.
Joey: We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man.
Chandler: I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
Melanie: Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'
Joey: Like the three musketeers, only with fruit.
Chandler:  Ooooh.
Monica:  OK, how does everybody like their burgers?
Rachel: Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later.
Monica: Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?
Joey: Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I...
Joey: Then you do. Heh, heh.
Monica: So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?
Joey: What do you mean?
Monica: Y'know, just be there for her.
Joey: Not following you.
Monica: Think about it.
Rachel: OK, I'm guessing this is from...
Rachel: Well, thank you, Melanie.
Chandler:  OK, this one right here is from me.
Rachel:  OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's...  _Travel Scrabble_! Oooohhh, thank you!
Rachel: This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And......it's a book!
Phoebe: Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!
Joey: : That book got me through some tough times.
Melanie: There is a little child inside this man!
Chandler: Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.
Rachel: Who's this from?
Chandler: Oh, that's Ross's.
Rachel: Oh... ...  Oh my God. He remembered.
Phoebe: Remembered what?
Rachel: It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!
Chandler: Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?
Phoebe: Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune.
Monica: I can't believe he did this.
Chandler: Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?
Rachel: What did you just say?
Chandler:  ahem... um... Crystal duck.
Rachel: No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?
Chandler:  F-hah.... flennin....
Rachel: Oh.... my God.
Chandler:  Oh, no-no-no-no-no....
Joey:  That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.
