Rachel: Hey. Got a second?
Barry: Sure, sure. Come on...  ...in...
Mindy: Hello, sweetheart.
Barry: Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?
Rachel: Uh, we are here to break up with you.
Barry: Both of you?
Mindy: Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you.
Barry: I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!
Rachel: Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?
Barry: ....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy.
Rachel: Even when we were having sex in that chair?
Barry:  I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you.
Rachel: Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
Mindy:  You did it twice?
Rachel: Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry.
Mindy: Okay...
Barry:  Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba.
Bernice:  Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer.
Barry: Oh God...  I'll be right there, Bernice.  Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back.
Rachel: Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great.
Mindy: Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
Rachel: What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!
Mindy: Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.
Rachel: Oh God.
Mindy: I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...?
Rachel: And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.
