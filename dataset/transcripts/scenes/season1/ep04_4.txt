Monica: Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?  Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch?
Rachel: What's that?
Monica: Weeeell, it's rum, and-
Rachel: Okay.
Monica: We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got _Twister_...
Phoebe: Ooh! Ooh! And I brought _Operation_! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
Monica: Uh, Rach, it's the _Visa _card people.
Rachel: Oh, God, ask them what they want.
Monica:  Could you please tell me what this is in reference to?  Yes, hold on.  Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
Rachel: But I haven't used my card in weeks!
Monica: That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
Rachel: They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?
Monica:  Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
Rachel: Alright, c'mon!  Let's play _Twister_!
