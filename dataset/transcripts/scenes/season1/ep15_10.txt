Rachel: Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
Monica: Hi Steve!
Steve: Hello, Monica.  Hello, greeter girl.
Monica:  This is Rachel.
Steve:  Yeah, OK.
Phoebe:  Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of  of, OK, smells.
Steve: It's a lovely apartment.
Monica: Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
Steve: I was just being polite, but, alright.
Rachel: What's up?
Phoebe:  In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.
Rachel: What?
Phoebe: Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
Rachel: OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.
Steve:  Is it dry in here?
Rachel: Let me, let me get you some wine!
Monica: Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course.  OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger.
Steve: Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!
Monica: I'm so glad you liked them!
Steve: Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!
Monica: Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
Steve: Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning.
Rachel: Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
Steve: You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.
Steve:  Ah, cool! Taco shells!  You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope.
Monica:  You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
Steve:  Hey! Sugar-O's!
Monica: You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
Steve: Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!
Monica: No, we don't.
Steve: Oh, OK.  Oh, sorry.
Monica: Why don't you just have a seat here?  OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
Steve:  No.
Monica: Give them to me.
Steve: Alright, we'll share.
Monica: No, give me the...
Steve: Well then you can't have any.  Bear overboard! I think he's drowning.  Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself!  "Help!  I'm drowning!   Help!"
Monica:  That's it! Dinner is over!
Steve: What?
Monica: What?
Steve: Why?
Monica: Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
Steve:  Hey!
