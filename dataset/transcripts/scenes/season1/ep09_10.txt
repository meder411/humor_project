Ross: And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
Carol: Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want.
Ross: Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
Susan: Hi, how's it goin?
Ross: Shh!  _Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey_!  Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
Carol: I did.
Ross: Does it always, uh--?
Carol: No, no that was the first.
Susan: Keep singing! Keep singing!
Ross:  _Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo_.
Susan: I felt it!
Ross:  _Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts_.
