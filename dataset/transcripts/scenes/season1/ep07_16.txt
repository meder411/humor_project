Chandler: _Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth._
Chandler: _Good save! We're back on track, and I'm..._  _..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking._
Jill: Are you alright?
Jill: My God, you're choking!  That better?
Chandler:  Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
Jill: Perfection?
