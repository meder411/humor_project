Joey and Chandler: Shut-out!!
Monica: Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
Joey: Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
Chandler: Yeah, get out!
Monica: You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies!  All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going,  and I'm gone.
Chandler:  One more game?
Joey: Oh yeah!
