Monica: Why don't you just take it with you?
Chandler: Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?
Monica: Why don't you just call her?
Chandler: I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.
Monica: Do you?
Chandler: No!  Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler!  I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone.
