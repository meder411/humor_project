Julie: Rachel, do you have any muffins left?
Rachel: Yeah, I forget which ones.
Julie: Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?
All: No thanks.
Julie:  Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go.
Rachel:  Thank you.  What a bitch.
Julie: Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at _Bloomingdale's_ who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?
Phoebe: I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet.
Monica: Ok, um, I'll go with you.
Julie: Great.
Ross:  Hi, honey.
Chandler: Hey, sweetums.
Ross: Hello to the rest.
All:  Hi!
Joey: Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
Monica: It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?
Chandler: Come on, you're going to _Bloomingdale's_ with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.
Monica: But I'm...
Phoebe: Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street.
Ross:  So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?
Monica: Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.
Ross: It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.
Monica: You're welcome.
Phoebe: Woof, woof.
