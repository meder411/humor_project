[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.]

**Joey:** All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat...

**Phoebe:** You know he's gay?

**Ross:** I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?

**Danielle:** (entering) Chandler?

**Chandler:** Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody.

**All:** Hi. Hi.

**Chandler:** What are you doing here?

**Danielle:** Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.

**Chandler:** ...I'm, I'm okay.

**Danielle:** Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?

**Chandler:** That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever...

**Danielle:** You got it.

**Chandler:** Okay.

**Danielle:** G'bye, everybody.

**All:** Bye.

**Phoebe:** Whoo-hoo!

**Monica:** Yeah, there you go!

**Ross:** Second date!

**Chandler:** ...I dunno.

**Rachel:** You **don't know**?!

**Chandler:** Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?

(They all groan and hit him..)

**End**
