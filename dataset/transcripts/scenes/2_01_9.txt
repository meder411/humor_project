Rachel: How is she?
Phoebe: It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign.
Ross: How's the hair?
Phoebe: I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.
Joey: Can we see her?
Phoebe: Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in.
Ross:  Yeah.
Joey: How're you doing?
Rachel: I'm okay.
Joey: Ooh, that bad, huh?
Rachel: What?
Joey: Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts.
Rachel: When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me.
Joey: You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
Rachel: Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
Joey: What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
Rachel: I don't know, I don't know.
Joey: Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.
Chandler:  Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec?  Your tailor is a very bad man!
Joey: Frankie? What're you talking about?
Ross:  Hey, what's goin' on?
Chandler: Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Ross: What?
Joey: No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
Chandler: Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite...
Ross: What?
Chandler: Cupping.
Joey: That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear.  What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?
Ross: Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?
Joey: What? That's not?  Oh my God.
