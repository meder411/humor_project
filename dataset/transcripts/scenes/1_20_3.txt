Chandler:  Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance.  Bye-bye.  Oh God!
Monica: That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
Chandler: Hey, I've been honing!
Ross: What was with the dishes?
Chandler: Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours.
Monica:  Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!
Phoebe: Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!
Monica: Great, now he's waving back.
Joey: Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!
Monica: What kinda stuff?
Joey: Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.
Phoebe: You cook naked?
Joey: Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.
Chandler: What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
