Phoebe:  Yeah?
Chandler: See that'll stop when you pick up the phone.
Phoebe: Oh. Uh, I'm on.
Phoebe:  Mr. Bing's office.  No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now.
Chandler: I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops.
Phoebe: Will he know what this is in reference to?  And he has your number?  All right, I'll see that he gets the message. Bye bye.
Chandler: What?
Phoebe: Ross says hi.
Chandler: Ah!
Phoebe: This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?
Chandler: Well, now, I actually have to get to work.

Chandler: Okay.
Phoebe: All right. Bye bye.
Chandler: Bye bye.
Chandler:  Yes?
Phoebe: Whatcha doin'?
Chandler: Ooh.
