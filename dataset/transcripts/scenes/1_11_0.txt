Phoebe: Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
Monica: Why?
Phoebe: Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
Monica: Oh my God.  Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
Phoebe: Where?  Ooh, come to Momma.
Monica: He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
Guy: Nice hat.
Monica and Phoebe:  Thanks.
Phoebe: We should do something. Whistle.
Monica: We are not going to whistle.
Phoebe: Come on, do it.
Monica: No!
Phoebe: Do it!
Monica: No!
Phoebe: Do it do it do it!
Monica:  Woo-woo!
Phoebe: I can't believe you did that!
