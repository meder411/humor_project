[Scene: Monica and Rachel's apartment, everyone is watching the tape of the
sonogram.   Rachel is on the phone.]

**Ross:** Well? Isn't that amazing? 

**Joey:** What are we supposed to be seeing here? 

**Chandler:** I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. 

**Phoebe:** You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. 

**Ross:** Then don't do that, alright? 

**Phoebe:** Okay! 

**Ross:** (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think? 

**Monica:** (welling up) Mm-hmm. 

**Ross:** Wh- are you welling up? 

**Monica:** No. 

**Ross:** You are, you're welling up. 

**Monica:** Am not! 

**Ross:** You're gonna be an aunt. 

**Monica:** (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up! 

**Rachel:** (on phone) Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. (Slams the phone down.) (To everyone) Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel **so** much better now.
