Monica: Did not.
Young Ethan: I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen.
Monica: How was that possible?
Young Ethan: Well, think about it. It's always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at gunpoint.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there?  Oh, ah. I should go.
Monica: Okay.
Young Ethan: Okay.
Monica: Unless...
Young Ethan: What?
Monica: Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so...
Young Ethan: Yeah, I'd really like that.
Young Ethan: Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know.
Monica: Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'I'm secretly married to a goat?'
Young Ethan: Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I haven't ever uh...
Monica: Ethan?
Young Ethan: Yeah?
Monica: Are you a virgin?
Young Ethan: Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person.
Monica: Really?
Young Ethan: Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?
Young Ethan: Wow!
Monica: You keep saying that.
Young Ethan: You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that.
Monica: Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to.
Young Ethan: Oh god, don't tell me, I did it wrong.
Monica: No-no. Nothing wrong about that.
Young Ethan: Oh.
Monica: Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months.
Young Ethan: Huh!
Monica: But I figured, you know, that shouldn't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are.
Young Ethan: Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said.
Monica: You're not a senior?
Young Ethan: Oh, I'm a senior... in High School.
Monica: Ok...ay.
