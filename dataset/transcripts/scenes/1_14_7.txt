Janice: Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?
Chandler: No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
Janice: Kiss me!
Monica: Oh, Chandler, sorry.
Monica: Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
Janice: Hi, Monica.
Chandler: Ok, well, this was very special.
Monica: Rach, come see who's out here!
Rachel: Oh my god. Janice, hi!
Chandler: Janice is gonna go away now.
Monica: I'll be right back.
Rachel: Oh, Joey, look who it is.
Joey:  Whoa.
Chandler: Oh, good, Joey's home now.
Janice: This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
Monica: Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to.  He just happened to call.
Janice: Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know?
