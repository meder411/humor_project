Lorraine: You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.
Joey: Good for you.  Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
Janice: By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.
Chandler: That's OK.
Janice: Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.
Joey:  We can't do that.
Chandler:  What? What can't you do?
Joey: Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
Joey: Uh, we might be leaving now.
Chandler: Tell me it's "you and me" we.

Chandler: Ok, you can not do this to me.

Lorraine:  Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?
Joey: I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
Chandler: I hope she throws up on you.
Chandler: So...
Janice: Just us.
Chandler: Oh, what a crappy night!
Janice: Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom.
Chandler: Excuse me.  How ya doin'?
Janice: So, do we have the best friends or what?
Chandler: Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
Janice: I will go for that drink.
Chandler: You got it. Good woman!  Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
Janice: Each.
Chandler: That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy.  I've always wanted to know...
