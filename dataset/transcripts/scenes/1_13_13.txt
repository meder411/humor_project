[Scene: Monica and Rachel's. Phoebe is reading the paper and Joey enters.]

**Phoebe:** Hey, Joey. What's going on?

**Joey:** Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green. (He goes into the bathroom. We hear a scream and he comes out, closely followed by Monica in a towel)

**Monica:** Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!

**Joey:** Sorry. Wrong boobies.

(He leaves. Cut to Monica entering Chandler and Joey's apartment. She sneaks
up to the shower door)

**Monica:** Hello, Joey.

(She whips back the curtain to reveal Joey's dad)

**Mr. Tribbiani:** Oh! ...Hello, dear. (She whips the curtain shut in horror)

**End**
