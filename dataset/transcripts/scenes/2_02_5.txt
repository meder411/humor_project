Carol: Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.
Ross: Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.
Susan: Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.  Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.
Rachel: Oh, this is so cute.
Susan: Oh, I got that for him.
Ross: My mommies love me. That's clever.
Monica: Hello? Oh, Hi, JuHi, Jew!   Uh huh?  Uh huh?  Ok.  Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye.
Rachel: Did you just say Hi, Jew?
Monica: Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.
