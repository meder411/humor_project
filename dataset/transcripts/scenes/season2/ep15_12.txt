RACHEL: What is this? What are we doing?
ROSS: Shh. Do you want cran-apple or cran-grape?
RACHEL: Grape.
ROSS:  OK, now, sit. OK.
RACHEL: Oh, God.
ROSS: Sorry.
RACHEL: Ah, so what are we looking at?
ROSS: Well uh, you see that, that little cluster of stars next to the big one?
RACHEL: Really?
ROSS: I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight.
RACHEL: Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight.
ROSS: You're not laughing.
RACHEL: This time it's not so funny.
RACHEL: Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK.
ROSS: What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box.
RACHEL: Oh, thank God.
