VAN DAMME:  I'm sorry it didn't work out between you and me,
RACHEL: OK, well, bye.
VAN DAMME: Goodbye.
MONICA: Well, bye for me too.
RACHEL: OK, well, bye-bye again.
MONICA: OK.
VAN DAMME: Perhaps, uh, the three of us, just could. . .

MONICA AND RACHEL: No no no no.
RACHEL: Impressive.
MONICA: But no. Maybe if I were baking.
MONICA AND RACHEL: Bye-bye.
