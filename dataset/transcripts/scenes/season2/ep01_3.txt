Ross: Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee?
Rachel: Yeah, sure.
Ross: Thank you.
Chandler: Hey, Rach, can I get...
Rachel: Did you talk to him?
Chandler: Not yet.
Rachel: Then, no.
Chandler: So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know.
Ross: I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?
Chandler: God?
Ross: It was you, pal.
Chandler: Well, maybe it was God, doing me.
Ross: Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you.
Chandler: Well, you owe me one, big guy.
Rachel:  Here's your lemonade.
Ross: I didn't order lemonade.
Rachel: Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that.
Ross: But...
Rachel: Go-go-go-go, come on!   So uh, what did you find out?
Chandler: He said...he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself!  Without any outside help whatsoever.
Rachel: How is that the silver lining?
Chandler: You have to really wanna see it.
