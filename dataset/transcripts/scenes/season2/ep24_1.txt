JOEY: Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it
MONICA: What, forget it!
RACHEL: Yeah, right.
JOEY: Come on, I need your help here.

JOEY: You see this, this is a friend.
PHOEBE: Uh-huh, let's go.  Oh, wait I have gum. Okay.
JOEY: Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
MONICA: Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you
JOEY: Yeah, that makes sense.

CHANDLER: And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
