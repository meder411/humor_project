Monica: Hey, where is everybody?
Rachel: They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
Monica: Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.
Rachel: Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way.  Here are your keys, hon.
Monica: Okay.
Rachel: Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?
Monica: You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
Rachel: And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?
Monica: That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
Rachel: Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?
Monica: Judy.
Rachel: Who?
Monica: Julie.
Rachel: What?!
Monica: Jody!
Rachel: You were with Julie?
Monica: Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping.
Rachel: Oh. Oh my God.
Monica: Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me.
Rachel: Yeah, right.  Sure!
Monica: Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!
Rachel: Oh, please, you wanted to get caught.
Monica: That is not true!
Rachel: Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?
Monica: Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
Rachel: Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to _Bloomingdale's_?  Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now.
