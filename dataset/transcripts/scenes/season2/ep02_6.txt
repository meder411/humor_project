Phoebe: Ben, dinner!
Ross: Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.
Phoebe: Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok.
Chandler: What did you just do?
Phoebe: I licked my arm, what?
Ross: It's breast milk.
Phoebe: So?
Rachel: Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.
Joey: What is the big deal?
Chandler: What did you just do?
Ross: Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?
Phoebe: You won't even taste it?
Ross: No!
Phoebe: Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
Ross: Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
