Monica: I don't know what else to say.
Rachel: Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.
Monica: I feel terrible, I really do.
Rachel: Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?
Monica: Rachel,  say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?
Rachel: Yes.
Monica: It's that terrible?
Rachel: Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.
Monica: Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean,  you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.
Rachel: I love you too.
Phoebe: You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too.  Oh, I really needed that.
Monica: Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?
Rachel:  I'd do anything for you, you know that.
Monica:  I'd do anything for you.
Phoebe: Wait, wait, wait, wait!
