Julie: So.
Rachel: So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?
Julie: I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.
Rachel: Really? Me?
Julie: Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.
Rachel: Well, you're not totally paranoid.
Julie: Oy.
Rachel: Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.
Julie: Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?
Rachel: Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.
Julie: I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.
Rachel: All right, Julie.
Julie: Bye.
Rachel: Bye.  What a manipulative bitch.
