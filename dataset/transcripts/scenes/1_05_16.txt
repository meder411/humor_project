[Scene: Central Perk, Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are there. Ross has an icepack
to his head.]

**Rachel:** Oh, are you sure you're ok?

**Ross:** Yeah.

**Rachel:** Does it still hurt?

**Ross:** Yeah.

**Phoebe:** (seeing Rachel's clothes) What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.

(Monica and Joey enter.)

**Monica:** Hi.

**Phoebe:** Hey, how'd it go?

**Joey:** Excellent.

**Monica:** We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.

**Ross:** What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.

**Monica:** (notices his head) Oh, I'm sorry.

**Rachel:** Where's Chandler?

**Phoebe:** Oh, he needed some time to grieve.

(Chandler runs by the window outside, joyous.)

**Chandler:** I'm free! I'm free!

**Phoebe:** That oughta do it.

**End**
