[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey and the girls are playing twister.]

**Ross:** (Doing the spinning) Okay, Monica: Right foot red. 

**Monica:** Could've played _Monopoly_, but nooooo. 

(There's a knock on the door, Chandler opens it, and silently hands back the
cushion.)

**Chandler:** Thanks. (The guy nods and leaves) 

**Ross:** Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. (Phoebe has to bend over.)Good. (Joey stares at her butt appreciatively) 

(The phone rings and Chandler answers it.)

**Chandler:** Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the _Visa _card people. 

**Rachel:** Oh, okay. Will you take my place? 

**Chandler:** Alright. (on phone) Yes, this is Rachel. 

**Rachel:** Nooo! (She grabs the phone and Chandler takes her place on the mat.) (On phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. (Listens) Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really. 

**Ross:** Green. To the green. 

**Rachel:** (on phone) I've got magic beans. (Listens) Never-never mind. 

**Chandler:** To the left, to the left- aww! (They all collapse) 

**Rachel:** (on phone) Ohhh... I'm fine.
