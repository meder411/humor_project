[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, all six are playing _Pictionary_ at Monica's
apartment. Monica is drawing a picture, and the three guys are guessing. She
draws what looks like an airplane.]

**Chandler:** _Airplane_! _Airport_! _Airport '75_! _Airport '77_! _Airport '79_!

(Timer goes off.)

**Rachel:** Oh, time's up.

**Monica:** (pointing at the drawing, upset) Bye... bye... **BIRDIE**.

**Joey:** Oh!

**Phoebe:** **That's** a bird?

(Monica glares at Phoebe.)

**Phoebe:** That's a **bird**!

(Monica sits, Rachel gets up.)

**Rachel:** OK, OK, it's my turn. (reads the answer)

**Chandler:** Go.

(Rachel starts drawing what looks like a bean.)

**Ross:** Uh.... bean! Bean!

(Rachel begins tapping the picture of the bean frantically.)

**Joey:** (triumphantly) _The Unbearable Likeness of Being_!

**Rachel:** Yes!

**Monica:** **That**, you get? **That**, you get?

(Monica picks up a glass to take a drink, everyone ducks as though she was
about to throw it.)

**End**
