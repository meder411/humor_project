[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone is mopping around and eating ice cream.] 

**Rachel:** Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun. 

**Ross:** Yeah. He could row like a viking. 

**Monica:** (entering) Hi. 

**All:** Mmm. 

**Ross:** So how'd it go? 

**Monica:** Oh, y'know.. 

**Phoebe:** Did he mention us? 

**Monica:** He said he's really gonna miss you guys. (dubious look) 

**Ross:** You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (She sits down and Ross strokes her forehead.) 

**Chandler:** ...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes. 

**All:** No no no! 

**Chandler:** (leaving) I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke! 

**Phoebe:** (shouting as he leaves) If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars! 

**Chandler:** (returns) Yeah, alright.

**End**
