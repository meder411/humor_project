[Scene: The Hospital, the camera is placed as though it were Ben's eyes.]

**Ross:** Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. (walks out of the picture) But I'll still always come back, like this. (returns) And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. (walks away) But I'll still always come back, like this. (returns) 

(Chandler comes into the picture.)

**Chandler:** And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this. (Does a baseball sign.)

(The rest of the group come into the picture.)

**Monica:** He is so amazing.

**Rachel:** Oh, I know. Look at him.

**Joey:** Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name.

**Phoebe:** Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. (screen goes blank) Look, he's opening his eyes. (picture comes back) 

**Joey:** He doesn't do much, does he?

**Ross:** No, this is pretty much it.

(long moment of silence)

**Rachel:** You guys wanna get some coffee?

**All:** Yeah.

**Ross:** All right, I'll see you guys later.

(They all leave but Ross, but they all come back a few seconds later. They
make faces at the baby.)

**Phoebe:** Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.

(The screen fades to black.)
