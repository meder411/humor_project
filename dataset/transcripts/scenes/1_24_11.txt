[Scene: Airport. Madonna's _Take A Bow_ plays in the background as Rachel
waits at the gate with flowers.]

**Rachel:** (sifting through crowd) Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi.

[Cut to the jetway, the old man who the flight attendant delivered Rachel's
message to gets off the plane, his wife still upset with him.]

**Man:** For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!

(A Chinese woman getting off the plane drops one of her bags. Ross gets off
next.)

**Ross:** Oh, hey, hey, I got that.

(Ross picks up the bag... then he and the woman kiss.)

**Julie:** Oh, thanks, sweetie.

**Ross:** No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.

**Julie:** Really?

**Ross:** Yeah. 

**Julie:** You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?

**Ross:** No, no, they will. I just... uh...

**Ross and **Julie:**** Can't wait.

**Ross:** Come on, they're gonna love you.

[Cut to a close-up of Rachel, eagerly awaiting Ross's arrival... not knowing
he is getting off the plane with another woman.]

**End**
