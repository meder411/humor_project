Monica: Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
Ross: I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten.
Monica: Thank you. My hair is very amused.
Chandler: Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true.
Phoebe:  Thank you.
Ross: Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rach.
Rachel:  Wait, are you leaving?
Ross: Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by "bye!"
Rachel: Well, can I talk to you for a sec?
Ross: Okay.
Joey: Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test...
Chandler: That's ok.
Ross: What's goin' on?
Rachel: Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all , what?
Ross: Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?
Rachel: No. No-no-no-no.
Ross: Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actuallyI-I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that.
Rachel: Really?
Ross: You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking "Oh my god, I'm with Rachel". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie.  Was there a second of all?
Rachel: No, I think that was the whole all.
Ross: Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
Joey: I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.
