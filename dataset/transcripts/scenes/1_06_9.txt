[Scene: Monica's Bedroom, she's lying in bed wide awake.]

**Monica:** (hums for a while, then gives up, and in her head) _If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help! _(She buries her head in her pillow.) 

**End**
