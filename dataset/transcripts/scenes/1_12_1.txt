Monica: Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna.  Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
Joey: Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
Ross: Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that!
Phoebe: Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta.
Chandler: And, we're done with the yogurt.
Phoebe:  Sorry.
Monica: Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas?  Nice talk, Aunt Syl.  You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
Joey: Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big?  This is your baby.  Hi Daddy!
Ross:  Hello!
Joey:  How come you don't live with Mommy?  How come Mommy lives with that other lady?  What's a lesbian?
Rachel: Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos
Paolo: Ah, poke  a  nose, mmm
Joey, Chandler, and Ross:  Mma, Mma, Mmaah
Monica: So, did I hear Poconos?
Rachel: Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
Phoebe: Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
Monica: Yeah, that's a big step.
Rachel: I know...
Chandler:  Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
Ross: Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?
Rachel: I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...
Ross: ...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration?  I could call immigration!
