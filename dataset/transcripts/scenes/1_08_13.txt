**Chandler:** Hey, Lowell.

**Lowell: **Hey, Chandler.

**Chandler:** So how's it going there in Financial Services?

**Lowell: **It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?

**Chandler:** Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.

**Lowell:** I know. That's what I told her.

**Chandler:** Really.

**Lowell:** Yeah.

**Chandler:** So- you can tell?

**Lowell:** Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.

**Chandler:** So you don't think I have a, a quality?

**Lowell:** Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is.

**Chandler:** He **is**?

**Lowell:** Yup, and waaay out of your league. (Exits)

**Chandler:** Out of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind him) If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey, Brian.

**End**
