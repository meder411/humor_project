1
00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:02,352
Tell him.

2
00:00:02,352 --> 00:00:03,336
Tell him.

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,399
Shut up.

4
00:00:04,399 --> 00:00:05,428
Tell me what?

5
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:07,335
You won't look at him.

6
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:11,333
I could use another reason why women won't look at me.

7
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:18,442
All right. All right. Last night, I had a dream that you and I were--

9
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:21,447
Doing it on this table.

10
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:25,486
Excellent dream score.

11
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,364
Why would you dream that?

12
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,491
More importantly was I any good?

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,565
Well, you were pretty damn good.

15
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:44,469
Interesting. In my dreams, I'm surprisingly inadequate.

16
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:49,505
Last night, you seemed to know your way around the table.

17
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:55,315
I love it when we share.

18
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:00,314
You okay?

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,228
I can't believe you two had sex in her dream.

20
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,265
Sorry, it was a one-time thing.

21
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:10,462
I was very drunk, and it was someone else's subconscious.

22
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,242
Hello, Rachel.

23
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,251
Get off.

24
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:10,259
Ooh, give me. Can you see me operating a drill press?

25
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:13,264
I don't know. What are you wearing?

26
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,237
Why would you want to?

27
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:23,275
For short-term work. Till I get back my massage clients.

28
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,243
Pirates again?

29
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:28,243
No. Nothing like that.

30
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,373
I'm just such a dummy.

31
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,478
I taught a ''Massage Yourself at Home'' workshop. And they are.

32
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:39,391
Hey, Chan, she could work for you.

33
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,292
Thanks, Joey. That's a good idea.

34
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:45,364
I could. I could do it. What is it?

35
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:50,459
My secretary's gonna be out. She's having one of her boobs reduced.

36
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,466
It's a whole big boob story.

37
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,973
I could be a secretary.

38
00:02:55,973 --> 00:03:03,347
I don't know if it'd be your thing because it involves being normal for a large portion of the day.

40
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,416
I could do that.

41
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,282
What's that?

42
00:03:08,282 --> 00:03:09,311
My new beeper.

43
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,222
Why does a paleontologist need a beeper?

44
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:17,319
Is it for dinosaur emergencies? Help. They're still extinct.

45
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:21,331
It's for when Carol goes into labor.

46
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:25,269
All she has to do is dial 55-JlMBO.

47
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,333
A cool number and a possible name for the kid.

48
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:30,892
See you later.

49
00:03:30,892 --> 00:03:32,342
Off to see young Ethan?

50
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,275
Thank you.

51
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,443
How young is young Ethan? Young?

52
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,476
He's our age.

53
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:42,447
When we were....

54
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,888
He's a senior in college.

55
00:03:47,888 --> 00:03:49,384
College?

56
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,297
Rob that cradle.

57
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,462
He's smart and mature and grown-up.

58
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,297
Mature and grown-up, he's a big boy.

59
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:05,209
This man-child has no problem with how old you are?

60
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:10,348
No, of course not. It's not even an issue because I said I was 22.

62
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,314
You what?

63
00:04:11,314 --> 00:04:12,212
What?

64
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,865
Oh, I can't pass for 22?

65
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:15,412
Well, maybe 25, 26.

66
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:17,319
I am 26.

67
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,416
There you go.

68
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,339
Can you hear that?

69
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,371
That'll stop when you pick up the phone.

70
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,311
Oh, I'm on.

71
00:04:43,311 --> 00:04:44,374
Okay.

72
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,345
Mr. Bing's office.

73
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,352
Sorry, he's in a meeting.

74
00:04:52,352 --> 00:04:54,348
I'm not in a meeting.

75
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,361
Will he know what this is in reference to?

76
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,294
And he has your number?

77
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:03,199
I'll see that he gets the message. Bye-bye.

78
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,396
Ross says hi.

79
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,436
This is so fun. What do we do now?

80
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,440
Well, now I actually have to get to work.

81
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,407
''Most likely.''

82
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,511
Okay, I'm gonna be out there.

83
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,256
All right. Bye-bye.

84
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,450
Bye-bye.

85
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,333
-Yes?
-What you doing?

86
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,531
Okay, windows are clean. Candles are lit.

87
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,367
Belt's too tight. Gotta change.

88
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:47,470
Did I turn the fish? Nope, because I made lasagna.

89
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,895
Am I out of control?

90
00:05:49,895 --> 00:05:51,442
Just a touch.

91
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:58,347
I don't understand. You've been dating this guy since his midterms.

93
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,324
Why, all of a sudden, are you so...?

94
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,749
What?

95
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:10,200
Could tonight be the night?

96
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:22,440
I don't know. He's a great guy and I love being with him. But, you know things happen when they happen. You don't plan these things.

99
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,866
So, did you shave your legs?

100
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:26,316
Yeah.

101
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:33,348
Would you let it go? It was just a dream.

102
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,257
It doesn't mean--

103
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,355
This is it. It's baby time!

104
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:42,332
All right, relax. Just relax. Be cool.

105
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,337
Yeah, hi. I was just beeped.

106
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:52,438
No, Andre is not here. Third time today.

107
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,439
Yes, I am sure.

108
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:59,348
I do not perform those kind of services.

109
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,182
Services?

110
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,276
Oh, services.

111
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:06,214
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO.

112
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:11,388
That's right.

113
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,489
That's right. JUMBO with a ''U,'' sir.

114
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:16,394
You don't want me.

115
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:20,434
Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment.

116
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,332
Alrighty, bye-bye.

117
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,213
How was the first day?

118
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:32,409
Excellent. Everyone was so, so nice.

119
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:36,420
It pays to know the man who wears my shoes.

120
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,315
Me.

121
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,892
I didn't tell anyone I knew you.

122
00:07:40,892 --> 00:07:42,325
Why?

123
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,328
Well, because, you know.

124
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,457
They don't like you.

125
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:51,431
What?

126
00:07:51,431 --> 00:07:52,426
I thought you knew.

127
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,959
Who doesn't like me?

128
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,443
Everyone.

129
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,371
Except for....

130
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,306
No. Everyone.

131
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:06,780
What are you talking about?

132
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,276
Don't feel bad.

133
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,378
They used to like you a lot.

134
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:15,388
But you got promoted, and now you're Mr. Boss Man. Mr. Big.

135
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,390
Mr. Bing. Boss Man Bing.

136
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,846
I can't believe it.

137
00:08:21,846 --> 00:08:23,393
Yeah. They even do you.

138
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,238
They ''do'' me?

139
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,205
You know, like, okay:

140
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,302
''Could that report be any later?''

141
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:39,314
I don't sound like that.

142
00:08:39,314 --> 00:08:40,411
Yeah, you do.

143
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:47,425
''The hills are alive with the sound of music.''

145
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:56,267
''My scone. My scone.''

146
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:01,397
I don't sound like that. That is so not true.

147
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:05,404
That is so not-- That is so not--

148
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,203
That-- Oh, shut up.

149
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,247
Did not.

150
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:18,288
Up until I was 9 I thought ''gunpoint'' was a place where crimes happened.

152
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,820
How's that possible?

153
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,316
It's always on the news.

154
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,295
''A man is being held up at Gunpoint.''

155
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,423
''Tourists are terrorized at Gunpoint.''

156
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,396
And I kept thinking, ''Why do people continue to go there?''

157
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,301
I should go.

158
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,287
Unless--

159
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,254
What?

160
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,348
Unless you wanna stay over.

161
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,325
I mean, I'm going to. So....

162
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,321
Yeah, I'd really like that.

163
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:13,438
Before we get into any staying-over stuff there's something you should know.

165
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:20,251
Is this, like, ''I have an early class tomorrow'' or ''I'm secretly married to a goat''?

167
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:24,254
Well, it's somewhere in between.

168
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:28,384
You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not....

169
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,453
Well, I mean, I haven't ever....

170
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,294
Ethan?

171
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,262
Are you a virgin?

172
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:42,269
If that's what you kids are calling it these days, then yes, I am.

174
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:48,474
I mean, you're just such a good kisser I would never have known.

175
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:53,479
Well, I've excelled at every level I've been to, I just....

176
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:59,480
I just haven't been to that particular one yet.

177
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:04,355
I've kind of been waiting for the right person.

178
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,846
Really?

179
00:11:05,846 --> 00:11:07,262
Yeah.

180
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,462
You do know I was talking about you, right?

181
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,275
Wow.

182
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,474
You keep saying that.

183
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,546
You know, you read about it. You see it in the movies.

184
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:34,452
Even when you practice it at home, man, oh, man it is nothing like that.

186
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,296
Listen, listen.

187
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,396
You told me something that was really difficult for you.

188
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:49,498
And I figure if you can be honest, then I can too.

189
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,377
Don't tell me I did it wrong.

190
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,472
Nothing wrong about that.

191
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,412
Here goes.

192
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,224
I'm not 22.

193
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:11,353
I'm 25...and 13 months.

195
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:18,267
But I figure that shouldn't change anything.

196
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:23,331
What does it matter how old we are? Basically, I'm nuts about you.

197
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:28,335
I knew after the first time we kissed. You didn't mention the Tic Tac.

198
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,439
I just thought you were naturally minty.

199
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:43,385
Listen as long as we're telling stuff...I have another one for you.

202
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:47,389
I'm a little younger than I said.

203
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,418
You're not a senior?

204
00:12:50,418 --> 00:12:58,366
Oh, I'm a senior...in high school.

206
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,223
What we did was wrong.

207
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:16,320
I just had sex with someone who wasn't alive during the bicentennial.

208
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,528
I just had sex.

209
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,429
Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?

210
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,905
You never said your age.

211
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:29,338
It's different.

212
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:33,468
My lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states.

213
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,910
What were you thinking?

214
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,440
I was too busy falling--

215
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,383
Don't say it.

216
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:41,283
In love with you.

217
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:42,852
Really?

218
00:13:42,852 --> 00:13:44,251
Sorry.

219
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,288
Well, fall out of it.

220
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:50,556
You shouldn't be here. It's a school night.

221
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,466
Oh, God.

222
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:59,496
I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad.

224
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,302
I'm Joan Collins.

225
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,407
Who?

226
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:21,256
Andre should be there in about 45 minutes.

227
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:28,222
Yes, sir, the kimonos are extra.

228
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,425
Alrighty. Bye-bye.

229
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,240
It's just easier that way.

230
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,858
You told me about the last dream.

231
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:41,241
No. Forget it.

232
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:45,283
Why not? Was I doing something particularly saucy?

233
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,479
All right. Fine.

234
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,448
You were not the only one there.

235
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,351
Joey was there too.

236
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,360
All right.

237
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:08,234
Was there...anybody else there?

239
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:14,406
You sure? Nobody handing out mints or anything?

241
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,350
No, it was just the three of us.

242
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,450
So was it you and Chandler then you and me, or you, me and Chandler?

244
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,289
You know what?

245
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:30,318
What?

246
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:35,324
There were times when it wasn't even me.

248
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,338
That is so sweet, you guys.

249
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,352
Mon, Ethan called again.

250
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,241
What?

251
00:16:04,241 --> 00:16:05,287
Ethan called again.

252
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,894
You're not seeing him anymore?

253
00:16:07,894 --> 00:16:09,390
No.

254
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,295
Sometimes, things don't work out.

255
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:17,432
This has nothing to do with him needing a note to get out of gym?

256
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:23,404
I did not say anything. I swear.

257
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,766
He stopped by.

258
00:16:25,766 --> 00:16:31,346
Next time you talk to him could you ask him which one the strongest Power Ranger is?

260
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:37,227
Oh, my life is just so amusing. Can we drop it now?

261
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,421
Sorry.

262
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,457
''It's morphin' time.''

263
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,382
Stegosaurus.

264
00:16:42,382 --> 00:16:43,531
Tyrannosaurus.

265
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,332
I gotta go.

266
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,270
Head rush.

267
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,246
One more, and then I have to go.

268
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,440
Cool.

269
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,414
Where you going?

270
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,383
A birthday party with some work people.

271
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,388
Work people? Nobody told me.

272
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:15,391
I know. That's part of the whole them-not-liking-you extravaganza.

274
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:19,437
A month ago, these people were my friends.

275
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:23,231
I'm in charge, but I'm not a different person.

276
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:28,302
Then come, hang out. Let them see what a great guy you still are.

277
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,376
You think I should?

278
00:17:29,376 --> 00:17:30,405
I really do.

279
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,318
But could we not go together?

280
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,418
I don't wanna be the geek who invited the boss.

281
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,862
Hey, you okay?

282
00:17:44,862 --> 00:17:46,295
Yeah.

283
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,849
This can't be easy for him either.

284
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:51,266
I know.

285
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:59,376
This may take some time for him to get over it but, then at four, Muppet Babies is on.

287
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:10,219
Go deep. Deep. Deep.

288
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,418
Sorry, Shelly.

289
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,185
See, with the fun?

290
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,194
Last night was great.

291
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:24,201
The karaoke thing? Tracy and I doing ''Ebony and Ivory.''

292
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:27,329
You were great. But they still made fun of you.

293
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,872
What?

294
00:18:28,872 --> 00:18:30,305
Now you're Mr. Caring Boss.

295
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,240
Mr. I'm-one-of-you Boss.

296
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:35,312
Mr. I-wanna-be-your-buddy Boss Man Bing.

297
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,213
Then I don't get it.

298
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:43,253
You know what? I think you just gotta face it.

299
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,448
You're the guy in the big office.

300
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,522
You're the one that hires and fires them.

301
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,358
They say you're a great boss.

302
00:18:50,358 --> 00:18:51,455
They do?

303
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,359
But they're not your friends anymore.

304
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,917
I just want--

305
00:18:56,917 --> 00:18:58,367
But you can't.

306
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,404
But I just want--

307
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:11,371
Are you gonna--?

308
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:19,282
Carol and I have a new system. If she punches in 9-1
-1  she's having a baby. Otherwise, I just ignore it.

310
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:20,415
What about Andre?

311
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:24,185
He got a call from our cousin, Nathan.

312
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:28,232
Frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know.

313
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,433
That was gonna be my opener.

314
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,246
Have you guys seen those new hand dryers in the bathroom?

315
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:43,927
I thought that was just a rumor.

316
00:19:43,927 --> 00:19:45,440
True story.

317
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,514
Look, I gotta tell you something.

318
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:56,216
I'm not 1 7. I said that so you'd think I was vulnerable.

319
00:19:56,261 --> 00:20:00,425
I'm actually 30. I have a wife and a job. I'm your congressman.

320
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:04,334
This is ridiculous. We're great together.

321
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:08,372
We can talk, make each other laugh, and the sex....

322
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,376
I have no frame of reference, but I thought that was great.

323
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:13,961
It was.

324
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:15,445
Then what's the problem?

325
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,273
Ethan, it's....

326
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,354
It's icky.

327
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,348
''Icky''?

328
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:30,259
You're actually gonna throw this away because it's ''icky''?

329
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:34,355
This isn't easy for me either. I wish things were different.

330
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:42,386
If you were older or I was younger or we lived in biblical times I could really--

333
00:20:42,386 --> 00:20:43,466
No, don't say it.

334
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,476
Love you.

335
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:50,360
Are your hands still wet?

336
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,406
Moist.

337
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,484
Let's dry them again.

338
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:03,425
Or, like, ''Could these margaritas be any stronger?''

339
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,422
Hey, Chandler.

340
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,324
Hello, Mr. Bing.

341
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,461
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.

342
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:17,465
Thanks. About the weekly numbers, I'm gonna need them on my desk by 9:00.

343
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,238
Sure.

344
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:20,233
No problem.

345
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,438
You have to give them something.

346
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,276
That was Gerston, Santos, and who's the other guy?

347
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,420
Petrie.

348
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,387
Petrie. Right, okay.

349
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:35,451
Well, some people are gonna be working this weekend.

351
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,349
Oh, that's nice.

352
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,221
Ross.

353
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:25,470
I'm here.

354
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,244
You are?

355
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,253
We were just....

356
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,457
What?

357
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,773
Great. Now I'm having a baby.

358
00:22:43,773 --> 00:22:45,286
What?

359
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,358
I'm having a baby. I'm having a--

360
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,965
The phone, the phone.

361
00:22:51,965 --> 00:22:53,461
I don't have the phone.

362
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,272
I'm hurt.

363
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:06,217
Let's go. Come on, people. Woman in labor.

364
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:07,898
Look what I got going.

365
00:23:07,898 --> 00:23:09,445
Save it for the cab.

366
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:13,220
We're going to a hospital.

367
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:16,351
I can't look nice? There are doctors there.

368
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:17,991
Joey, get out of the fridge.

369
00:23:17,991 --> 00:23:19,521
All right.

370
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:21,327
What is that?

371
00:23:21,327 --> 00:23:22,322
For the ride.

372
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:23,865
Like in a cab--

373
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:24,462
Save it.

374
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,733
Hating this.

375
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:28,229
Monica, come on. Let's go.

376
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,329
Baby coming.

377
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:32,241
I can't believe I'm gonna be an aunt.

378
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,891
I'll have a nephew.

379
00:23:33,891 --> 00:23:35,438
That's nice. Get out.

380
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,376
All right, I'm going. I'm going.

381
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:50,284
Here we go. Come on.
