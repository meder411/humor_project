1
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:16,472
We're running low on résumés.

2
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:19,478
You want a job with Popular Mechanics?

3
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:24,245
If you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones.

4
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:29,294
Guys, I'm going for anything here. I can't be a waitress anymore.

5
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:34,390
I'm sick of the lousy tips. I'm sick of being called ''Excuse Me.''

6
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,966
Paper cut! Paper cut!

7
00:00:36,966 --> 00:00:38,564
Here.

8
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:44,377
Grapefruit juice! Grapefruit juice!

9
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:48,370
Okay, we're almost done. Only 20 more to go.

10
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,898
Rach, did you proofread these?

11
00:00:50,898 --> 00:00:53,315
Yeah. Why?

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,423
Nothing. I'm sure they'll be impressed with your ''compuper'' skills.

13
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:03,428
Oh, my God! Do you think it's on all of them?

14
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,430
No, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few.

15
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:15,332
They call this a love seat but I'm not feeling anything special towards you.

16
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,295
Hey, guys.

17
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:27,245
Hey.

18
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,442
Hi, ladies.

19
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:33,350
Can I get you anything? Did you bring the mail?

20
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,434
Lots of responses.

21
00:02:35,434 --> 00:02:37,482
Really? Sure, we have scones left!

22
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:39,358
Read them.

23
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:44,294
''Dear Miss Greene: Thank you for your inquiry. However--''

24
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,881
We have apple cinnamon--

25
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:50,497
''Dear Ms. Greene....'' Yeah, yeah! No.

26
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,872
What?

27
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:56,271
Your Visa bill is huge!

28
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,401
Give me that.

29
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,214
Linda's great. Why won't you go out with her?

30
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:03,327
I don't know.

31
00:03:03,327 --> 00:03:08,216
Is this about her ''The Flintstones could have really happened'' thing?

33
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:15,250
It's not just that. I want someone who does something for me who gets my heart pounding.

35
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,263
Who makes me....

36
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:22,457
Little playthings with yarn?

37
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,329
What?

38
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,340
Could you want her more?

39
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:29,441
Who?

40
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,337
Dee, the sarcastic sister from What's Happening!!.

41
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,449
Look, I'm totally over her.

42
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,420
Hi!

43
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,284
Coffee?

44
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,421
No, we're fine.

45
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:47,484
Okay.

46
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,862
Shut up!

47
00:03:54,862 --> 00:03:56,358
We're not saying anything.

48
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,852
What?

49
00:03:57,852 --> 00:03:59,302
Joey cried last night.

50
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,887
Thank you.

51
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:03,434
We were playing poker--

52
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:08,306
There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight.

53
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:12,216
You should have seen him. ''Read them and weep!''

54
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,220
And then he did.

55
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:19,214
Now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?

56
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,320
Yeah, what is that? Like some kind of sexist guy thing?

57
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,393
It's poker, so only guys can play?

58
00:04:25,393 --> 00:04:27,423
No. Women can play.

59
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:32,427
Then, what is it? Some kind of, like, some kind of, you know--

60
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,463
All right, what is it?

61
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,367
There are just no women in our game.

62
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:42,380
We just don't know any women who know how to play poker.

63
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,282
That is a lame excuse. It's a typical guy response.

64
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,343
Do you know how to play?

65
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,454
No.

66
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,987
But you could teach us.

67
00:04:52,987 --> 00:04:54,483
No.

68
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:04,232
Okay, so now we draw cards.

69
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,306
So I wouldn't need any. I have a straight.

70
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,905
Oh, good for you!

71
00:05:10,905 --> 00:05:12,401
Congratulations!

72
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:16,829
Pheebs, how many do you want?

73
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:18,444
I just need two.

74
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,415
The 10 of spades and the 6 of clubs.

75
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,356
No, you can't--

76
00:05:25,356 --> 00:05:27,256
I have the 10 of spades! Here.

77
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,227
Thanks!

78
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,781
No, you can't do that.

79
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:35,232
Don't need them. I'm going for fours.

80
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,462
Oh, you're--

81
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:42,367
You're going for fours. Chandler, could you--? Thanks, man.

82
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,438
Here we go.

83
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:52,245
We've got salmon roulettes and crudités.

84
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,252
What are you doing?

85
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,256
In poker, there's no food with more than one syllable.

86
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:02,294
It's got to be like chips or dip or pretz--

87
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:08,390
I hope you'll let it slide just this once. I was all out of ''pretz.''

88
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,328
Now the dealer--

89
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:15,306
We got it. Let's play for real. High stakes. Big bucks!

90
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:20,402
You sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy.

91
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,309
But I'm ready. So just deal.

92
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:30,345
Okay, last-minute lesson! Joey....

93
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,254
Three.

94
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,314
Eight.

95
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,253
Eight. Three. All right, very good.

96
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,235
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

97
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,430
Joey had two fives showing, so for you to raise was--

98
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,434
Yes?

99
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,271
Downright gutsy.

100
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:54,875
I see, so you were lying.

101
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,371
About what?

102
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,962
About how good your cards were.

103
00:06:57,962 --> 00:06:59,475
I was bluffing.

104
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,184
And what is bluffing?

105
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:08,284
Is it not another word for lying?

106
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:13,390
Sorry to break up this party, but I've got to go fax résumés before work.

107
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:14,898
We've got to settle.

108
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:16,297
Settle what?

109
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,399
The Jamestown colony of Virginia.

110
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:25,300
See, King George is giving us the land....

111
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,277
The game, Rachel. You owe us money.

112
00:07:30,277 --> 00:07:32,307
Right.

113
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:36,252
It's their first time. Let's forget about the money.

114
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:39,222
Hell, no. We'll pay!

115
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:42,419
Monica, I had another answer all ready.

116
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,425
And you know what? We want a rematch.

117
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,334
That's fine with me. Could use some money.

118
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,735
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

119
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:57,232
Well, yeah, I am.

120
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:01,312
So you get your ya-yas by taking money from your friends.

121
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:06,276
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from IlKEA.

122
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:12,180
You have to put them together yourself, but they cost less.

123
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:15,326
Look, this is poker. I play to win.

124
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,226
For me to win, others have to lose.

125
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:22,199
If you're gonna play, don't expect me to be nice.

126
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:25,204
Because once those cards are dealt....

127
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:35,439
Yeah?

128
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,413
I'm not a nice guy.

129
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,421
All right, let's eat.

130
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:53,431
Did you get that from the ''I Love Rachel Pizzeria''?

131
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,246
You still on that?

132
00:08:56,246 --> 00:08:58,225
What was with that Black Bart speech?

133
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:01,306
''When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy.''

134
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,367
You're way off.

135
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:07,310
No, I don't think so, because I think you love her!

136
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:13,184
No. I might have had feelings for her at one time. Not anymore.

137
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,208
I just--

138
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,414
Marcel! Where are you going with that disk?

139
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,317
You are not putting that on again.

140
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:24,386
If you press that button, you are in very big trouble.

141
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:58,262
You believe what a jerk Ross was being?

142
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,895
Yeah, I know.

143
00:09:59,895 --> 00:10:01,459
He can get really competitive.

144
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,463
What?

145
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,365
''Hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black!''

146
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,376
Please!

147
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,338
I'm not as bad as Ross.

148
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:20,249
I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?

149
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,353
That wasn't an incident.

150
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:27,256
I was gesturing and the plate slipped out of my hand.

151
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,810
I got an interview!

152
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,357
You're kidding! Where?

153
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,369
Saks Fifth Avenue.

154
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,303
Oh, Rachel!

155
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:43,306
It's like the mother ship is calling you home.

156
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,475
What's the job?

157
00:10:48,475 --> 00:10:50,471
Assistant buyer.

158
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,478
I would be shopping!

159
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,318
For a living!

160
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:02,359
That's Aunt Iris. She's been playing poker since she was 5.

161
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,420
You've got to listen to every word she says.

162
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,749
Is Tony Randall dead?

163
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:09,233
I don't think so.

164
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,899
He may be now. I hit him with my car.

165
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:12,463
My God, really?

166
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:16,366
No, that's bluffing. Lesson number one.

167
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:23,375
Let me tell you something. Everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap!

168
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,865
Nice earrings.

169
00:11:24,865 --> 00:11:26,281
Thank you.

170
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,838
Girls, sit down.

171
00:11:30,838 --> 00:11:33,289
Aunt Iris, this is Phoebe and Rachel.

172
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:37,352
Listen, I'm parked at a meter. Let's do it. Okay?

173
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,458
We'll start with five-card draw.

174
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:46,495
Then we'll go into the studs and the hold 'ems. I talked to Cousin Nathan.

175
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:50,367
Don't touch the cards when somebody is dealing.

176
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:56,372
How is Nathan?

177
00:11:56,415 --> 00:12:00,249
Now he thinks he's a man in a woman's body.

178
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,311
Don't you mean a woman in a man's body?

179
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,220
It should be so simple.

180
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:20,236
Ross, could we please listen to anything else?

181
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,240
All right.

182
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,281
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.

183
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,297
Hi. Guys, guess what?

184
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:53,304
The fifth dentist caved, and now they're all recommending Trident?

185
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,243
No, the interview!

186
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:04,348
Unbelievable! She absolutely loved me.

187
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,409
We talked for over two hours. We've the same taste in clothes.

188
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,321
And I went to camp with her cousin.

189
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,791
The job is perfect! I can do this.

190
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,225
That's great!

191
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,292
Then she told a funny story.

192
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:20,322
Great, tell us and we'll laugh.

193
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,357
Let's play poker!

194
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:28,332
Listen, we talked about it and if you don't wanna play, it's okay.

195
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,434
Yes, we can play some other game. Like Pictionary?

196
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,439
Very funny.

197
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,245
But we'd like to try poker again.

198
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:41,241
Yes, I think we should.

199
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,952
Do you want me to shuffle those?

200
00:13:43,952 --> 00:13:46,551
That's okay, I'm gonna give it a go.

201
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,470
So Pheebs owes $ 7.50. Monica owes $10.00.

202
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,432
And Rachel, you owe 1 5 big ones!

203
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:08,209
Thanks for teaching us Cross-Eyed Mary. We gotta play that other way.

204
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:12,446
All right, here's my $ 7.50. But this money is cursed.

205
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,316
What?

206
00:14:14,316 --> 00:14:15,413
I cursed it!

207
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,453
Now bad things will happen to the spender.

208
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:24,218
I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway.

209
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,365
This way, I can split them up with a movie.

210
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:33,235
So that just leaves the big Greene poker machine, who owes 1 5.

211
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,240
Could you be any smugger?

212
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:46,274
Let's see. Rach, I'm opening up a new art gallery and I could sure use the portraits of Lincoln and Hamilton.

214
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:51,480
It's so typical. ''I'm a man! I have a penis!

215
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:56,285
I have to win money to exert my power over women!''

216
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,389
This isn't over.

217
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,225
We'll play you again. We'll win. You'll lose.

218
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,203
You'll beg. We'll laugh.

219
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:11,333
We'll take every last dime you have. And you'll hate yourselves forever!

220
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,438
Kind of stepped on my point there, Mon.

221
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,310
I can't believe you lost! How much did they take?

222
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,353
Like 30 bucks.

223
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:23,887
I'll give you that money back.

224
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:25,320
Really?

225
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:29,360
No, I'm bluffing! You guys haven't learned crap!

226
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,428
Hand me the cards!

227
00:15:33,428 --> 00:15:34,525
Can I?

228
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,529
Yes!

229
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:49,238
Wanna give us your money now? We can skip the formality of really playing.

230
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:53,375
No, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh, monkey boy.

231
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:59,448
Done with chitchat? Ready for serious poker?

232
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:03,427
You guys, look! The one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go.

233
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,198
Right. Serious poker.

234
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,398
Mon, got any more of those salmon--?

235
00:16:09,398 --> 00:16:11,497
You want to eat or play poker?

236
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,767
Where are you going?

237
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:15,297
To the bathroom.

238
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:18,310
Want to go to the bathroom or play poker?

239
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,244
Go to the bathroom.

240
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,798
Well, I'm gonna order a pizza.

241
00:16:23,798 --> 00:16:25,248
No!

242
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:30,311
I'm waiting to hear from that job. The store closes at 9:00. Eat then.

243
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:34,417
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic Tac to hold me over.

244
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,423
All right. Cincinnati. No blinds. Everybody, ante.

245
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:40,463
Yes!

246
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,235
Or no.

247
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,735
All right! Your money's mine, Greene.

248
00:16:48,735 --> 00:16:51,232
Your fly's open, Geller.

249
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:02,414
You know what I just realized? Joker is poker with a ''J''!

250
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:06,383
Coincidence?

251
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,424
That's jo-incidence with a ''C''!

252
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,871
Phoebe?

253
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:25,401
Yeah, I'm out.

254
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,862
I'm in.

255
00:17:27,862 --> 00:17:29,312
Me too.

256
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,315
Me too. What do you got?

257
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:36,449
You better hop out of the shower, because I got a flush.

258
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,323
Well, well, well!

259
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:46,330
Hop back in, bucko, because I got four sixes!

260
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:50,425
I got four sixes! I won! I actually won! Oh, my God!

261
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,228
You know what? I'll make a little Ross pile.

262
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,330
Look!

263
00:17:55,441 --> 00:18:00,276
I think that one was Ross'. And I think that one was Ross'.

264
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:05,372
Well, I have got your money And you'll never see it

265
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,210
And your fly's still open

266
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,288
I made you look

267
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,355
I'm in.

268
00:18:14,355 --> 00:18:15,418
I couldn't be in-er.

269
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,390
Monica, in or out?

270
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,223
I hate this game!

271
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,334
Joey, your bet.

272
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:37,238
I fold like a hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face.

274
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:41,443
I'm out.

275
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,885
Ross?

276
00:18:44,885 --> 00:18:46,415
I'm very in.

277
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,338
Chandler?

278
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:49,350
Couldn't be more out.

279
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:52,363
Me too. Rachel?

280
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:58,470
I will see you and I'll raise you. Do you wanna waste another buck?

281
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,304
No, not this time. What did you have?

282
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,391
I'm not telling.

283
00:19:03,391 --> 00:19:04,375
Show them.

284
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:04,903
No.

285
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:05,397
Show them!

286
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,207
Get your hands out of there!

287
00:19:08,207 --> 00:19:10,203
I've had dates like this.

288
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,309
Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you?

289
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:21,188
Your whole face is getting red. Veins popping out of your temple!

290
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:24,387
Plus, that shirt doesn't really match those pants.

291
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,863
I'm not losing.

292
00:19:29,863 --> 00:19:31,393
You're definitely losing.

293
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,195
Hello. Rachel Greene.

294
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,409
Excuse me. It's about the job!

295
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,404
Barbara, hi! How are you?

296
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,410
No, I understand.

297
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:54,349
Come on. No, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah.

298
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:58,362
But if anything else opens up, please--

299
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,330
Hello?

300
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,441
Sorry, Rach.

301
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,287
There's gonna be lots of other stuff.

302
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,481
Okay.

303
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,458
Where were we?

304
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:34,365
Five-card draw. Jacks are better. Nothing wild. Everybody, ante.

305
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,399
Look, Rach, we don't have to do this.

306
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:39,498
Yes, we do.

307
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,369
All right. Check.

308
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:44,364
Check.

309
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:45,989
I'm in for 50 cents.

310
00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:47,502
Call.

311
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,508
I'm in.

312
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:56,413
I see your 50 cents and I raise you $5.

314
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,482
I thought it was a 50-cent limit.

315
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,454
I just lost a job, I'd like to raise it $5.

316
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,355
Does anyone have a problem with that?

317
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:07,243
Not at all.

318
00:21:07,243 --> 00:21:08,255
No.

319
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,531
Loser?

320
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,459
No, I fold.

321
00:21:23,459 --> 00:21:25,438
What do you mean, you fold?

322
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:30,347
I thought that, ''Once the cards are dealt, I'm not a nice guy.''

323
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,288
Were you just full of it?

324
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:47,360
I'm in.

325
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:49,368
How many do you want?

326
00:21:49,368 --> 00:21:50,363
One.

327
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,510
Dealer takes two.

328
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,809
What do you bet?

329
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:57,305
I bet $2.

330
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:07,357
Okay. I see your $2 and I raise you...20.

333
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:17,325
I see your $20...raise you $25.

335
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:26,467
I see your $25 and Monica, get my purse.

336
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,284
Rachel, there's nothing in it.

337
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,482
Okay, then get me your purse.

338
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:44,979
Here you go. Good luck!

339
00:22:44,979 --> 00:22:46,463
Thank you.

340
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:53,361
I saw your $25 and I raise you seven.

342
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:55,398
--teen!

343
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,215
Joey, I'm a little shy.

344
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:09,344
That's okay, Ross. You can ask me.

345
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,355
What do you need?

346
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:17,350
1 5.

347
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:18,424
Here's 10.

348
00:23:18,424 --> 00:23:19,419
I got 5.

349
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:20,459
Thank you.

350
00:23:20,459 --> 00:23:21,454
Good luck.

351
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,435
I am calling your 1 7.

352
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,438
What do you got?

353
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,341
Full house.

354
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,356
You got me.

355
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,334
That's tough to beat.

356
00:24:00,334 --> 00:24:01,397
I thought we had it!

357
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:05,438
When you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards.

358
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,337
But look how happy she is.

359
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:19,840
Airmail.

360
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,324
Airplane. Airport. Airport '75!

361
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,419
Airport '77! Airport '79!

362
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,230
Time's up!

363
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:29,460
Bye Bye Birdie!

364
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,427
That's a bird?

365
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,332
That's a bird!

366
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,369
Okay, it's my turn.

367
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:42,338
Go!

368
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:47,247
Bean! Bean!

369
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:51,253
