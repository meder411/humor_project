1
00:00:07,404 --> 00:00:10,464
She's having my baby, and she's not here yet.

2
00:00:10,573 --> 00:00:12,023
Has her water broken yet?

3
00:00:12,023 --> 00:00:13,473
I don't know.

4
00:00:14,277 --> 00:00:18,373
When we talked, she said she'd already passed the mucous plug.

5
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:22,408
Do we have to know about that?

6
00:00:23,319 --> 00:00:25,412
What'll you do when you have a baby?

7
00:00:25,488 --> 00:00:29,322
I'll be in the waiting room, handing out cigars.

8
00:00:29,392 --> 00:00:34,386
Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the '50s.

9
00:00:35,398 --> 00:00:38,390
She could be giving birth in the cab.

10
00:00:38,501 --> 00:00:46,398
Relax. It's only $2 for the first contraction and then 50 cents for each additional contraction.

12
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:49,603
What, it's okay when Chandler does it?

13
00:00:50,346 --> 00:00:52,541
You have to pick your moments.

14
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:54,508
Did I miss it?

15
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:56,035
She's not here yet.

16
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:57,519
What's with the guitar?

17
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:02,257
We might be here for a while. Things might get musical.

18
00:01:02,392 --> 00:01:04,326
Where have you been?

19
00:01:04,326 --> 00:01:06,260
We stopped at the gift shop.

20
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:08,388
I got this, and Susan wanted a Chunky.

21
00:01:08,465 --> 00:01:12,492
You're having a baby. You don't stop for Chunkies.

22
00:01:13,303 --> 00:01:16,272
I used to have that bumper sticker.

23
00:01:16,473 --> 00:01:18,498
You see what I mean?

24
00:02:05,488 --> 00:02:07,388
''Stopped for a Chunky.''

25
00:02:07,388 --> 00:02:09,288
Let it go, Ross.

26
00:02:09,392 --> 00:02:11,383
I got an extra one. You want this?

27
00:02:15,398 --> 00:02:17,349
How's my favorite parenting team?

28
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:19,300
Dr. Franzblau.

29
00:02:19,369 --> 00:02:22,361
I understand you're thinking of having a baby.

30
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:26,398
I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start.

31
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,794
How are your contractions?

32
00:02:28,794 --> 00:02:30,278
I love them.

33
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,474
Each one's like a little party in my uterus.

34
00:02:34,284 --> 00:02:36,297
Every 4 minutes, lasting 55 seconds.

35
00:02:36,297 --> 00:02:38,310
59 seconds. Quartz.

36
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:40,378
Swiss quartz.

37
00:02:42,492 --> 00:02:43,988
Am I allowed to drink anything?

38
00:02:43,988 --> 00:02:45,484
Ice chips.

39
00:02:45,595 --> 00:02:46,994
At the nurse's station.

40
00:02:46,994 --> 00:02:48,393
I'll get it!

41
00:02:48,498 --> 00:02:49,948
No, I'll get it.

42
00:02:49,948 --> 00:02:51,398
No, I'm getting it.

43
00:02:52,502 --> 00:02:56,302
Hi. Thought you might like some ice chips.

44
00:02:56,506 --> 00:02:58,019
Thanks.

45
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,470
And if you need anything else-- I do not believe we've met.

47
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:04,471
I'm Rachel Greene.

48
00:03:05,281 --> 00:03:08,341
I'm Carol's ex-husband's sister's roommate.

49
00:03:08,484 --> 00:03:11,351
Nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau.

50
00:03:11,387 --> 00:03:16,347
I'm your roommate's brother's ex-wife's obstetrician.

51
00:03:16,492 --> 00:03:18,357
Oh, that's funny.

52
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:27,360
I want a baby.

53
00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:31,271
Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow.

54
00:03:31,307 --> 00:03:33,440
Get up. Let's get some coffee.

55
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,573
Okay, because we never do that.

56
00:03:37,313 --> 00:03:41,374
Shoot, shoot, shoot. Or just fall down. That's good too.

57
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:43,407
Knick fan?

58
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,902
Oh, boy, do they suck.

59
00:03:45,902 --> 00:03:48,285
Listen, lady--

60
00:03:49,492 --> 00:03:51,585
Look. Look at your man, Ewing.

61
00:03:52,328 --> 00:03:55,422
He couldn't hit water if he was standing on a boat.

62
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:56,964
And who do you like?

63
00:03:56,964 --> 00:03:58,397
Celtics.

64
00:03:58,434 --> 00:04:01,426
Celtics? They couldn't hit a boat if--

65
00:04:02,238 --> 00:04:03,466
Wait....

66
00:04:04,474 --> 00:04:06,465
They suck, all right?

67
00:04:07,343 --> 00:04:09,436
Shut up. It's a rebuilding year--

68
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:15,249
Let me get the father. We need a father over here.

69
00:04:15,351 --> 00:04:17,285
There's no father.

70
00:04:19,255 --> 00:04:21,251
Oh, sorry.

71
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:23,247
That's okay. I'm fine.

72
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,394
Okay. Right this way.

73
00:04:26,462 --> 00:04:30,398
All the other pregnant women seem to be going in here.

74
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:40,374
They're tiny and chubby And so sweet to touch

75
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,312
But soon they'll grow up And resent you so much

76
00:04:46,316 --> 00:04:50,275
Now they're yelling at you And you don't know why

77
00:04:50,386 --> 00:04:54,379
And you cry and you cry And you cry

78
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:57,484
And you cry and you cry And you cry

79
00:04:57,527 --> 00:04:59,392
Thanks, Ross.

80
00:04:59,392 --> 00:05:01,257
I'm paying you to stop.

81
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:07,325
Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute.

82
00:05:08,438 --> 00:05:09,427
No fair.

83
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:12,434
I don't even have one. How come they get two?

84
00:05:13,242 --> 00:05:14,305
You'll get one.

85
00:05:14,305 --> 00:05:15,368
When?

86
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:22,478
Tell you what. When we're 40, if neither of us are married what do you say we have one?

88
00:05:23,252 --> 00:05:26,244
Why won't I be married when I'm 40?

89
00:05:26,356 --> 00:05:28,290
I just meant hypothetically.

90
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:32,384
Hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?

91
00:05:33,262 --> 00:05:37,392
What is it? Is there something unmarriable about me?

92
00:05:38,368 --> 00:05:39,494
Well?

93
00:05:40,303 --> 00:05:43,272
Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack.

94
00:05:47,477 --> 00:05:49,502
Look at you, dressy-dress.

95
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,574
Did you go home and change?

96
00:05:52,315 --> 00:05:55,512
It's an important day. I want to look nice.

97
00:05:56,386 --> 00:05:58,377
Has Dr. Franzblau been by--?

98
00:05:59,522 --> 00:06:01,217
I haven't seen him.

99
00:06:01,324 --> 00:06:04,225
Where is he? He is supposed to be here.

100
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:08,320
What if the baby needs him?

101
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:13,232
What's the deal with you and doctors? Is your father a doctor?

102
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:14,327
Yeah. Why?

103
00:06:15,438 --> 00:06:17,269
No reason.

104
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,271
Mom, we've been through this.

105
00:06:21,344 --> 00:06:23,471
No, I am not calling him.

106
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,340
I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk.

107
00:06:27,383 --> 00:06:31,251
No, I am not alone. Joey's here.

108
00:06:32,255 --> 00:06:33,483
What do you mean ''Joey who''?

109
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:35,281
Joey who?

110
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:36,887
Tribbiani.

111
00:06:36,887 --> 00:06:38,383
Joey Tribbiani.

112
00:06:39,462 --> 00:06:43,398
Yes. Okay. Hold on.

113
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:45,490
She wants to talk to you.

114
00:06:46,402 --> 00:06:47,562
Take the phone.

115
00:06:49,372 --> 00:06:50,464
Yeah, it's me.

116
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,366
No, we're just friends.

117
00:06:55,378 --> 00:06:56,504
Yeah, I'm single.

118
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,277
Twenty-five.

119
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:02,417
An actor. Hello?

120
00:07:07,423 --> 00:07:10,256
She's not much of a phone person.

121
00:07:10,326 --> 00:07:14,228
So, what's the deal with this father guy?

122
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,266
If someone was having my baby, I'd wanna know about it.

123
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:23,327
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? No.

124
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:27,771
Maybe I should just go.

125
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:29,267
Maybe you should.

126
00:07:29,378 --> 00:07:34,249
Good luck...and take care.

128
00:07:40,356 --> 00:07:43,450
The Celtics problem is that the players run the team.

129
00:07:43,493 --> 00:07:45,376
That is so not true.

130
00:07:45,376 --> 00:07:47,259
Oh, it is.

131
00:07:47,296 --> 00:07:48,280
Breathe.

132
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,264
Breathe.

133
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:51,364
You're gonna kill me.

134
00:07:52,268 --> 00:07:54,264
Fifteen more seconds. 1 4, 13, 1 2--

135
00:07:54,264 --> 00:07:56,260
Count faster.

136
00:07:56,372 --> 00:08:00,308
It'll be okay. Keep focusing on Jordy. He'll be here soon.

137
00:08:00,343 --> 00:08:02,373
Three. Two. Who the hell is Jordy?

138
00:08:02,373 --> 00:08:04,403
Your son.

139
00:08:05,214 --> 00:08:09,207
I don't have a son named Jordy. We all agreed on Jamie.

140
00:08:09,252 --> 00:08:14,346
Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend so we went back to Jordy.

142
00:08:14,524 --> 00:08:19,223
What do you mean, back to Jordy? We never landed on Jordy.

143
00:08:19,262 --> 00:08:23,460
We just passed by it during the whole Jesse-Cody-Dillon fiasco.

144
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,426
Ow! Leg cramp!

145
00:08:27,236 --> 00:08:28,282
I got it.

146
00:08:28,282 --> 00:08:29,328
I got it. I'm doing it.

147
00:08:29,372 --> 00:08:31,465
You get to sleep with her. I get the cramps.

148
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:33,265
No, you don't.

149
00:08:33,342 --> 00:08:35,435
That is it. I want both of you out.

150
00:08:35,478 --> 00:08:36,410
She started it.

151
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,342
He did.

152
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:45,243
I'm trying to get a person out of my body here and you're not making it any easier! Now go!

154
00:08:47,256 --> 00:08:47,870
Thanks.

155
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,484
See what you did?

156
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:50,276
Listen--

157
00:08:50,276 --> 00:08:51,260
Out!

158
00:08:53,296 --> 00:08:55,457
Breathe. Breathe.

159
00:09:02,238 --> 00:09:05,298
What is that? Something exploded.

160
00:09:06,342 --> 00:09:07,923
That's not the baby, is it?

161
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,504
Her water broke. Calm down.

162
00:09:10,246 --> 00:09:13,306
Water breaking? What do you mean? What's that?

163
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,350
Breathe. Breathe.

164
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:22,357
I'm okay. I'm okay. That's disgusting. I'm okay.

165
00:09:23,326 --> 00:09:24,873
This is so your fault.

166
00:09:24,873 --> 00:09:26,420
How is this my fault?

167
00:09:26,462 --> 00:09:30,262
Carol never threw me out of a room before you.

168
00:09:30,366 --> 00:09:34,234
There's a lot of things Carol never did before me.

169
00:09:34,437 --> 00:09:36,837
Are you trying to be clever?

170
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:39,237
You're so threatened by me.

171
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:43,336
Hey. Okay, all right. That's it. Get in here.

172
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:46,473
My God, you guys. I don't believe you.

173
00:09:47,283 --> 00:09:54,254
There are children coming into the world here and your fighting isn't the first thing they should hear.

175
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,451
So stop all the yelling! Just stop it!

176
00:09:59,395 --> 00:10:04,298
Don't make me do this again! I don't like my voice like this!

177
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:11,397
Who wants to hear something ironic?

178
00:10:15,478 --> 00:10:17,469
Are they here yet?

179
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,373
Don't worry, we're gonna find them.

180
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:23,510
And until we do, we are all here for you. Okay?

181
00:10:25,421 --> 00:10:28,515
You were telling me about Paris. It sounds wonderful.

182
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:33,489
There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel--

183
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:36,293
There you go, dear.

184
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:38,897
You find them?

185
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:40,495
Not in the gift shop or cafeteria....

186
00:10:40,603 --> 00:10:43,299
Where are Phoebe and Joey?

187
00:10:43,506 --> 00:10:46,407
There's something sinister going on here.

188
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:54,506
If you find anyone, or parts of anyone scream. And scream again.

190
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,936
Help!

191
00:10:58,936 --> 00:11:00,352
Come on!

192
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:02,323
I'm having a baby in there!

193
00:11:02,323 --> 00:11:04,257
Hello!

194
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,453
Okay, everyone stand back.

195
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:11,288
Ow.

196
00:11:12,368 --> 00:11:15,394
All right, good thing we're in a hospital.

197
00:11:16,372 --> 00:11:18,363
Come on, Lydia, you can do it.

198
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:21,409
Push him out, push him out. Harder, harder.

199
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:24,303
Push him out, push him out. Way out.

200
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,315
Let's get that ball and really move.

201
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,407
Let's get--

202
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:35,321
I was just-- Yeah, okay. Push, push, push.

203
00:11:37,393 --> 00:11:40,294
What are you gonna do, suck the door open?

204
00:11:42,431 --> 00:11:45,298
Help! Help!

205
00:11:46,302 --> 00:11:50,295
And they found their bodies The very next day

206
00:11:50,406 --> 00:11:54,399
And they found their bodies The very next--

207
00:11:59,415 --> 00:12:01,349
Mom, everything's going fine.

208
00:12:01,383 --> 00:12:03,248
Ross is great.

209
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:05,550
He's in a whole other place.

210
00:12:06,388 --> 00:12:08,253
No, he's gone.

211
00:12:08,457 --> 00:12:11,483
No, you don't have to fly back. Really.

212
00:12:12,261 --> 00:12:16,391
What do you mean ''This might be your only chance''? I'm only 26.

213
00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:20,367
I'm not even thinking about babies yet.

214
00:12:32,481 --> 00:12:33,977
Where have you been?

215
00:12:33,977 --> 00:12:35,473
I just had a baby.

216
00:12:37,386 --> 00:12:38,478
Mazel tov.

217
00:12:43,392 --> 00:12:45,383
It could be one hour or three.

218
00:12:45,427 --> 00:12:47,486
But relax. She's doing great.

219
00:12:48,297 --> 00:12:52,427
So tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?

220
00:12:53,435 --> 00:12:56,529
Not at the moment, I'm not. Are you?

221
00:12:57,306 --> 00:13:00,332
No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.

222
00:13:00,442 --> 00:13:04,378
Right. Yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors.

223
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:12,249
No, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know where I do.

225
00:13:15,357 --> 00:13:18,349
I try not to let work affect my personal life.

226
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:23,295
But it's hard when, when you do what I do. It's, like....

227
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,560
Well, for instance, what do you do?

228
00:13:26,302 --> 00:13:27,394
I'm a waitress.

229
00:13:28,504 --> 00:13:33,407
Aren't there times when you come home at night and you're, like:

230
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:37,468
''If I see one more cup of coffee....''

231
00:13:42,418 --> 00:13:44,318
Gotcha.

232
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:46,482
I'm gonna check up on your friend.

233
00:13:46,482 --> 00:13:48,478
That's fine.

234
00:13:57,433 --> 00:13:58,946
How'd you know I was here?

235
00:13:58,946 --> 00:14:00,459
Your mom called me.

236
00:14:01,337 --> 00:14:03,328
So is this her?

237
00:14:03,372 --> 00:14:05,431
No, this is a loaner.

238
00:14:07,376 --> 00:14:09,537
Ours is at the shop.

239
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,543
God, I hope she has my brains.

240
00:14:14,383 --> 00:14:17,352
I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.

241
00:14:17,553 --> 00:14:22,490
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse and a helper guy.

242
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:26,924
So did you see who won the game?

243
00:14:26,924 --> 00:14:29,455
The Knicks by 10. They suck.

244
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,461
They're not so bad.

245
00:14:56,492 --> 00:14:58,392
Come on. Come on.

246
00:14:58,494 --> 00:15:00,877
You're doing it too hard.

247
00:15:00,877 --> 00:15:03,260
You have to do it hard or else--

248
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:05,257
Damn it. Damn it.

249
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:07,460
Damn it, damn it. This is all your fault.

250
00:15:08,237 --> 00:15:10,364
This should be the greatest day of my life.

251
00:15:10,472 --> 00:15:13,339
My son is being born, and I should be in there.

252
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,434
Instead, I'm stuck in a closet with you.

253
00:15:16,245 --> 00:15:19,271
I have been waiting for this as much as you.

254
00:15:19,381 --> 00:15:22,441
No one's been waiting for this as much as I have.

255
00:15:22,484 --> 00:15:24,281
You know what's funny?

256
00:15:24,353 --> 00:15:27,481
You go home with the baby. Where does that leave me?

257
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,382
You're his father.

258
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:33,451
Who am I? There's Father's Day. There's Mother's Day.

259
00:15:33,495 --> 00:15:36,293
There's no Lesbian Lover Day.

260
00:15:36,398 --> 00:15:38,491
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.

261
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,405
This is so great.

262
00:15:47,409 --> 00:15:49,468
Do you wanna explain that?

263
00:15:49,578 --> 00:15:57,284
I mean, when I was growing up, my dad left and my mother died and my stepfather went to jail.

265
00:15:57,386 --> 00:16:00,446
I barely had enough pieces to make one whole parent.

266
00:16:01,323 --> 00:16:11,256
And here's this baby who has three whole parents who fight over who gets to love it the most and it's not even born yet.

269
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:15,267
It's just the luckiest baby in the whole world.

270
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:19,332
I'm sorry. You were fighting.

271
00:16:21,276 --> 00:16:22,436
Where are they?

272
00:16:22,544 --> 00:16:23,994
They'll be here.

273
00:16:23,994 --> 00:16:25,444
They wouldn't miss this.

274
00:16:26,248 --> 00:16:31,345
Relax. You're only at 9 centimeters, and the baby's at zero station.

275
00:16:34,356 --> 00:16:36,290
You are really frightening me.

276
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,488
Somebody wanna help me? Trying to rip out my heart.

277
00:16:43,265 --> 00:16:45,392
That's great. Anybody seen a nipple?

278
00:16:47,503 --> 00:16:50,267
Ten centimeters. Here we go.

279
00:16:50,305 --> 00:16:51,835
Time to start pushing.

280
00:16:51,835 --> 00:16:53,365
But they're not here yet.

281
00:16:53,475 --> 00:16:55,875
I can't tell the baby to wait.

282
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,275
Oh, God.

283
00:17:02,351 --> 00:17:03,847
Okay, got the vent open.

284
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:05,343
Hi, I'm Ben.

285
00:17:07,322 --> 00:17:09,415
I'm hospital worker Ben.

286
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:12,226
It's Ben to the rescue.

287
00:17:14,463 --> 00:17:17,432
Ben, you ready? Give me your foot.

288
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:21,464
On three, Ben. One, two, three.

289
00:17:22,337 --> 00:17:25,363
Come on, Ben. That's it, Ben.

290
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,467
What do you see?

291
00:17:28,544 --> 00:17:32,241
I see what appears to be a dark vent.

292
00:17:32,314 --> 00:17:33,338
Wait.

293
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:36,441
Yes, it is, in fact, a dark vent.

294
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:42,382
Pheebs, it's open. It's open.

295
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,454
Wait. You forgot your legs.

296
00:17:49,398 --> 00:17:50,928
Push. Push.

297
00:17:50,928 --> 00:17:52,458
We're here. We're here.

298
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:55,395
Where have you been?

299
00:17:56,405 --> 00:17:57,463
Long story.

300
00:17:57,506 --> 00:18:03,274
I need you to keep pushing. I need-- Excuse me, can I have this?

301
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:08,272
There's too many people here. There's about to be one more.

302
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:13,354
So if you're not an ex-husband or lesbian life partner, out you go.

303
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:16,270
Bye-bye.

304
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,316
Good luck, you guys.

305
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:21,318
Do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?

306
00:18:21,363 --> 00:18:22,421
Out.

307
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:26,323
Here he comes.

308
00:18:26,435 --> 00:18:29,336
Let me see. I've gotta see.

309
00:18:33,475 --> 00:18:35,238
A head.

310
00:18:35,444 --> 00:18:38,242
It's huge. How are you doing this?

311
00:18:39,348 --> 00:18:41,339
You're not helping.

312
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,350
You're doing great.

313
00:18:43,452 --> 00:18:44,419
Hello?

314
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:45,386
Oh, sorry.

315
00:18:45,454 --> 00:18:47,445
What do you see? What do you see?

316
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:53,354
We got a head. We got arms. Oh, look at the little fingers.

317
00:18:53,495 --> 00:18:59,365
A chest and a stomach and it's a boy, definitely a boy.

319
00:18:59,468 --> 00:19:01,402
Legs, knees and feet.

320
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,234
He's here.

321
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:12,437
He's a person.

322
00:19:13,315 --> 00:19:14,310
Look.

323
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,305
What does he look like?

324
00:19:16,218 --> 00:19:19,312
Kind of like my Uncle Ed, covered in Jell-O.

325
00:19:20,322 --> 00:19:21,414
Really?

326
00:19:22,257 --> 00:19:24,316
You guys, he's beautiful.

327
00:19:24,426 --> 00:19:26,326
Thanks, Pheebs.

328
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:37,236
No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy.

329
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,236
How about Ben?

330
00:19:40,236 --> 00:19:42,232
I like Ben.

331
00:19:42,444 --> 00:19:43,536
Ben.

332
00:19:48,283 --> 00:19:51,377
Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?

333
00:19:51,486 --> 00:19:54,353
We just cooked it up.

334
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,381
That's what we were off doing.

335
00:20:00,462 --> 00:20:01,878
Can we come in?

336
00:20:01,878 --> 00:20:03,294
Yeah, come on.

337
00:20:10,405 --> 00:20:12,305
I know. I know.

338
00:20:12,374 --> 00:20:15,468
Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet.

339
00:20:16,411 --> 00:20:17,861
This is Ben.

340
00:20:17,861 --> 00:20:19,311
Hi, Ben.

341
00:20:19,381 --> 00:20:21,315
Ben, this is everybody.

342
00:20:22,384 --> 00:20:24,477
Susan, he looks just like you.

343
00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:28,513
Thanks.

344
00:20:29,391 --> 00:20:32,485
I can't believe one of us actually has one of these.

345
00:20:33,295 --> 00:20:35,388
I know. I still am one of these.

346
00:20:39,401 --> 00:20:40,493
Can I?

347
00:20:42,437 --> 00:20:45,429
Okay, the head. You gotta....

348
00:20:54,316 --> 00:20:56,511
I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes, I am.

349
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:59,310
I'm your Aunt Monica.

350
00:21:04,459 --> 00:21:06,359
I will always have gum.

351
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:20,469
Ben I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around like this.

354
00:21:23,412 --> 00:21:29,282
But I'll still always come back...like this.

356
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:35,415
And sometimes, I may be away longer like this.

358
00:21:39,394 --> 00:21:46,333
But I'll still always come back...like this.

360
00:21:47,402 --> 00:21:52,499
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third and I'll go like this:

361
00:22:01,283 --> 00:22:03,251
He is so amazing.

362
00:22:03,352 --> 00:22:05,479
Yeah, I know. Look at him.

363
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,452
Nothing. I don't think that's his name.

364
00:22:16,298 --> 00:22:18,459
Look, he's closing his eyes.

365
00:22:19,401 --> 00:22:22,268
Look, he's opening his eyes.

366
00:22:24,406 --> 00:22:26,397
He doesn't do much, does he?

367
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:29,368
Nope, this is pretty much it.

368
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:39,480
You guys wanna get some coffee?

369
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:42,586
I'll see you guys later.

370
00:23:16,258 --> 00:23:18,351
He's closing his eyes again.
