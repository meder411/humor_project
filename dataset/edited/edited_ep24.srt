1
00:00:04,553 --> 00:00:09,252
Oh, here's little Ben falling asleep.

2
00:00:09,358 --> 00:00:13,556
A little bit later. Is he gonna sleep?

3
00:00:14,296 --> 00:00:19,256
Is he gonna sleep? Is he gonna?

4
00:00:19,368 --> 00:00:22,269
Yep, out like a light!

5
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:25,499
This sure trumps the ''Has he pooped?'' series.

6
00:00:26,275 --> 00:00:27,503
Ross, we love him, okay?

7
00:00:28,277 --> 00:00:31,303
But right now he's just a little fat guy.

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,506
How excited can we get?

9
00:00:35,384 --> 00:00:36,880
What you got?

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,376
400 pictures of Ben on a rug.

11
00:00:38,487 --> 00:00:39,983
Oh, my God!

12
00:00:39,983 --> 00:00:41,479
Let me see!

13
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:30,363
Here's little Ben nodding off.

14
00:01:30,473 --> 00:01:33,374
Look at Aunt Monica's little boy!

15
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:35,427
Look, he's got Ross' haircut.

16
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:37,378
Let me see.

17
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,472
Oh, God! Is he just the sweetest thing?

18
00:01:41,283 --> 00:01:44,377
You must just wanna kiss him all over.

19
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,383
That would be nice.

20
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:53,923
Pardon?

21
00:01:53,923 --> 00:01:54,417
Nothing.

22
00:01:54,497 --> 00:01:57,398
Just a little extra air in my mouth.

23
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:05,466
Chan, can you help me out? I'll pay you back.

24
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:13,272
Right. Including the waffles last week, you now owe me 1 7 jillion dollars.

26
00:02:13,482 --> 00:02:15,916
Really, I'll pay you back this time.

27
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,350
Where's this money coming from?

28
00:02:18,454 --> 00:02:22,254
I'm helping out at the NYU Med School with research.

29
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:23,484
What kind of research?

30
00:02:25,494 --> 00:02:27,553
Just, you know, science.

31
00:02:28,464 --> 00:02:30,364
Science.

32
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:34,462
Yeah, I think I've heard of that.

33
00:02:36,472 --> 00:02:39,407
It's a fertility study.

34
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:45,275
Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time.

35
00:02:46,382 --> 00:02:49,374
Actually, a little more than that.

36
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:54,516
Thank you, God. This will bring us so much joy.

37
00:02:55,391 --> 00:02:58,292
Come on, it's not that big a deal.

38
00:02:58,327 --> 00:03:04,222
I just go down there every other day and make my contribution to the project.

40
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,234
But at the end of two weeks, I get $ 700!

41
00:03:08,337 --> 00:03:11,363
You're gonna be making money hand over fist.

42
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:15,433
That's funny. Very funny.

43
00:03:16,278 --> 00:03:21,375
This is great. I actually know somebody who loves what they do.

44
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:27,483
But what do you do to unwind after a tough day at work?

45
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:33,257
Okay, we got the coleslaw and buns.

46
00:03:33,362 --> 00:03:37,458
The ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys.

47
00:03:39,268 --> 00:03:41,498
I just love barbecuing with you.

48
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:44,462
Men are here!

49
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:51,376
We make fire.

50
00:03:53,415 --> 00:03:54,575
Cook meat.

51
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:58,309
Put out fire by peeing, no get invited back.

52
00:03:58,387 --> 00:03:59,479
Cute.

53
00:04:00,256 --> 00:04:01,353
Melanie called. She'll be late.

54
00:04:01,353 --> 00:04:02,450
Okay.

55
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:08,253
How are things going? Is she becoming your ''special someone''?

56
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:12,366
I don't know. She's pretty great.

57
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:16,336
What does she think of your little science project?

58
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,366
You think I'd tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?

59
00:04:24,446 --> 00:04:26,277
Man's got a point.

60
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:30,250
The tough thing is, she really wants to have sex.

61
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:32,286
Crazy bitch.

62
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:46,462
I got a week left to go. According to the rules I can't conduct personal experiments, if you know what I mean.

64
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:50,404
Joey, we always know what you mean.

65
00:04:57,513 --> 00:05:01,313
How long did you think this barbecue would last?

66
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,784
I'm going to China.

67
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:06,218
Jeez, you say one thing, and....

68
00:05:06,455 --> 00:05:08,434
China?

69
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:10,413
For the museum. Someone found a bone.

70
00:05:11,226 --> 00:05:13,251
They don't want us to have it.

71
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:18,460
I'm going to try to persuade them. It's a whole big bone thing.

72
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:21,361
Anyway, I'll be gone for a week.

73
00:05:21,437 --> 00:05:26,534
If you want to reach me, you can't. So here's my itinerary.

74
00:05:28,243 --> 00:05:29,358
Here's a picture of me.

75
00:05:29,358 --> 00:05:30,473
Oh, let me see.

76
00:05:31,347 --> 00:05:36,341
Could you show it to Ben every now and then so he doesn't forget me?

77
00:05:36,485 --> 00:05:40,251
''Hi, Ben. I'm your father.''

78
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:44,349
''I am The Head!''

79
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:52,490
This barbecue's gonna be very fun.

80
00:05:53,268 --> 00:05:56,465
I wanted to wish Rachel a happy birthday before I left.

81
00:05:57,272 --> 00:05:59,354
She's out having drinks with Carl.

82
00:05:59,354 --> 00:06:01,436
Hey, who's Carl?

83
00:06:04,346 --> 00:06:07,213
That guy she met at the coffeehouse.

84
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:09,331
There's this guy she met at--

85
00:06:09,331 --> 00:06:11,413
The coffeehouse? Right.

86
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:14,212
So you do know who he is.

87
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:20,326
I'll go say goodbye to the guys.

88
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:23,456
Hey, you know what? Tell them that bone story.

89
00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:32,372
I have to go to China.

90
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:34,272
The country?

91
00:06:35,344 --> 00:06:39,440
No, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront.

92
00:06:40,382 --> 00:06:42,282
Do you know who Carl is?

93
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:46,481
Let's see. Alvin, Simon, Theodore.... No.

94
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:51,258
Rachel's having drinks with him tonight.

95
00:06:51,293 --> 00:06:54,490
How can she, when she's never shown interest in you?

96
00:06:55,397 --> 00:06:56,830
Forget about her.

97
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,263
He's right.

98
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:01,302
Please move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food.

99
00:07:01,437 --> 00:07:04,429
Of course, there they just call it ''food.''

100
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,403
Yeah, I guess. I don't know.

101
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:12,339
All right, just give her this for me, okay?

102
00:07:12,448 --> 00:07:16,316
We're looking out for you. We want you to be happy.

103
00:07:16,418 --> 00:07:21,219
I may only have a couple beers in me, but I love you.

104
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:24,453
I'm still on my first.

105
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:30,227
I just think you're nice.

106
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:40,431
That's when we started this fruit basket business.

107
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:45,345
We call ourselves ''The Three Basketeers.''

108
00:07:45,447 --> 00:07:49,247
Like ''The Three Musketeers,'' only with fruit.

109
00:07:55,357 --> 00:07:56,853
How do you want your burgers?

110
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:58,349
Presents first!

111
00:07:58,393 --> 00:08:01,294
We're doing presents first.

112
00:08:02,498 --> 00:08:07,197
Hey, hold on there, tiger. How are you holding up?

113
00:08:07,302 --> 00:08:15,333
Well, not so good. She thinks tonight we're gonna complete the transaction, if you know what-- And you do.

115
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:19,312
Have you ever thought about being there for her?

116
00:08:19,448 --> 00:08:21,416
What do you mean?

117
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,451
You know, just be there for her.

118
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:32,418
Not following you.

119
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:37,455
Think about it.

120
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:47,504
Okay. I'm guessing this is from....

121
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:52,313
Thank you, Melanie.

122
00:08:52,313 --> 00:08:54,247
This one right here is from me.

123
00:08:54,349 --> 00:08:59,286
Okay. It's light. It rattles.

124
00:08:59,354 --> 00:09:04,283
It's...Travel Scrabble!

126
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:09,296
Thank you.

127
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:14,334
This one's from Joey.

128
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:19,340
It feels like a book, I think it's a book. And it's a book!

129
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:21,399
It's Dr. Seuss!

130
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:26,313
That book got me through some tough times.

131
00:09:26,448 --> 00:09:29,349
There's a little child inside this man.

132
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:33,320
The doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.

133
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:36,419
Who's this from?

134
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:37,414
From Ross.

135
00:09:43,465 --> 00:09:47,526
Oh, my God! He remembered!

136
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,787
Remembered what?

137
00:09:49,787 --> 00:09:51,237
It was months ago.

138
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,468
We walked by this antique store. I saw this pin.

139
00:09:55,243 --> 00:09:59,441
I told him it was like one my grandma had when I was little.

140
00:10:00,248 --> 00:10:02,375
I can't believe he remembered!

141
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:06,353
Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?

142
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,296
It's so pretty! This must've cost him a fortune.

143
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,388
I can't believe it.

144
00:10:16,465 --> 00:10:23,362
Remember when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that expensive crystal duck?

146
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:26,303
What did you just say?

147
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:39,477
Crystal duck.

148
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:48,591
No, no, no. The ''love'' part?

149
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:58,322
Oh, my God!

150
00:10:58,322 --> 00:11:01,240
Oh, no, no, no.

151
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:07,238
That's good. Just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time.

152
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:16,449
This is unbelievable. I mean, this is unbelievable!

153
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,454
I know. This is really, really huge.

154
00:11:19,494 --> 00:11:24,363
No, it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.

155
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,393
I don't think any of our lives will ever be the same ever again.

156
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:33,373
Is there a mute button on this woman?

157
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:37,377
I think this is so great. I mean, you and Ross!

158
00:11:37,412 --> 00:11:38,896
Did you have any idea?

159
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:40,380
No, none!

160
00:11:40,482 --> 00:11:46,477
My first night in the city, he mentioned asking me out but nothing ever happened.

162
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:50,285
What else did he say? Does he wanna go out?

163
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:56,394
Given that he's in love with you he wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee.

165
00:11:56,498 --> 00:12:01,435
Ross? All this time? I've gotta talk to him.

166
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:03,003
He's in China!

167
00:12:03,003 --> 00:12:04,470
The country.

168
00:12:08,276 --> 00:12:09,368
Is his flight gone?

169
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,470
Yes! He's watching a woman do this:

170
00:12:13,248 --> 00:12:14,237
He's gone!

171
00:12:14,282 --> 00:12:16,477
His flight doesn't leave for 45 minutes.

172
00:12:17,285 --> 00:12:19,264
What about time difference?

173
00:12:19,264 --> 00:12:21,243
From here to the airport?

174
00:12:22,357 --> 00:12:23,403
You'll never make it!

175
00:12:23,403 --> 00:12:24,449
I've gotta try.

176
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,251
What'll you say to him?

177
00:12:27,295 --> 00:12:28,392
I don't know.

178
00:12:28,392 --> 00:12:29,489
Then you shouldn't go.

179
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:33,462
Right. If you're gonna break his heart, that can wait.

180
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:36,260
But if it's good, tell him now.

181
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:38,822
Maybe I'll know when I see him.

182
00:12:38,822 --> 00:12:41,273
All right, does this help?

183
00:12:47,282 --> 00:12:52,379
No. Look, all I know is, I cannot wait a week. This is just too big.

184
00:12:52,487 --> 00:12:56,480
I've just gotta talk to him. Okay, I'll see you later.

185
00:12:56,525 --> 00:13:00,359
Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first!

186
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:14,230
All right.

187
00:13:19,347 --> 00:13:21,298
Ross! Excuse me, pardon me.

188
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:23,249
Your boarding pass?

189
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:25,285
I need to talk to my friend.

190
00:13:25,353 --> 00:13:29,346
Sorry, you're not allowed here without a pass.

191
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:32,451
He's right there, in the blue jacket! Can I--?

192
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:34,489
I'm sorry. Federal regulations!

193
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:39,256
Then could you please just give him a message for me?

194
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:41,363
This is very important.

195
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,359
All right. What's the message?

196
00:13:44,372 --> 00:13:46,306
I don't know.

197
00:13:48,276 --> 00:13:52,508
Excuse me, sir! Excuse me, sir? I have a message for you.

198
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:57,377
Rachel loved the present. She'll see you when you get back.

199
00:13:57,485 --> 00:13:59,316
What?

200
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:03,315
Toby, I don't know what she's talking about.

201
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:07,521
There's no Rachel. Don't give me that deep freeze.

202
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:21,272
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!

203
00:14:21,376 --> 00:14:25,244
I think I blacked out there for a minute.

204
00:14:26,248 --> 00:14:28,239
It was nothing.

205
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:32,343
Well, now we gotta find something fun for you.

206
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,287
You know what?

207
00:14:39,294 --> 00:14:42,491
Forget about me. Let's give you another turn.

208
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:47,335
Me, again?

209
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:49,303
Sure. Why not?

210
00:14:51,506 --> 00:14:57,502
Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow!

211
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:06,444
I gotta tell you, you are nothing like I thought you'd be.

212
00:15:07,222 --> 00:15:08,314
How do you mean?

213
00:15:08,423 --> 00:15:13,224
I had you pegged as a guy who's always, ''Me, me, me!''

214
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:16,354
But you, you're a giver.

215
00:15:17,532 --> 00:15:20,433
You're the most generous man I ever met.

216
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:23,534
I mean, you're practically a woman.

217
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:33,362
You're just saying that.

218
00:15:33,362 --> 00:15:35,245
No.

219
00:15:36,484 --> 00:15:38,349
A woman!

220
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:50,410
So?

221
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,456
I missed him.

222
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:52,932
I'm so sorry.

223
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:54,365
That's too bad.

224
00:15:54,402 --> 00:15:56,302
Yeah, right.

225
00:15:56,504 --> 00:15:58,495
No, I feel bad for her. I do.

226
00:15:59,307 --> 00:16:02,401
I can think of somebody other than myself.

227
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:04,435
All right, I'm going to bed.

228
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:07,895
Happy birthday. Hang in there.

229
00:16:07,895 --> 00:16:09,442
Thanks.

230
00:16:10,452 --> 00:16:11,441
Yes!

231
00:16:14,322 --> 00:16:15,346
Pizza coupons.

232
00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:24,355
Okay. You guys want help cleaning up this mess?

233
00:16:24,432 --> 00:16:26,332
That'd be great.

234
00:16:29,437 --> 00:16:32,463
So, Rach, you wanna save this wrapping paper?

235
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:37,473
Are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I throw it out?

236
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:44,441
I don't know. I don't know.

237
00:16:44,486 --> 00:16:52,349
Thought about it all the way there and I thought about it all the way back. You know, it's Ross!

239
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,258
You know what I mean? It's Ross.

240
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:56,313
Sure!

241
00:16:56,313 --> 00:16:57,263
Sure.

242
00:16:57,298 --> 00:17:07,197
I don't know. This is just my initial gut feeling but I'm thinking it'd be really great.

244
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:10,439
Oh, my God, me too! We'd be like friends-in-law!

245
00:17:12,213 --> 00:17:15,239
The best part is you already know all about him.

246
00:17:15,316 --> 00:17:17,341
You start on the 1 5th date.

247
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:21,252
But it would be like starting on the 1 5th date.

248
00:17:22,223 --> 00:17:24,214
Another good point.

249
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:31,456
I mean, on the 1 5th date, you're already in a very ''relationship-y'' place. You're committed.

251
00:17:35,336 --> 00:17:37,429
What happens if it doesn't work out?

252
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:39,354
Why isn't it working out?

253
00:17:39,354 --> 00:17:40,469
Sometimes it doesn't.

254
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:44,473
Is he not cute enough? Does he not make enough money?

255
00:17:45,246 --> 00:17:46,742
No, I'm just--

256
00:17:46,742 --> 00:17:48,238
Maybe there's someone else.

257
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:50,382
Is there someone else?

258
00:17:50,382 --> 00:17:52,481
No, there is no one else.

259
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:55,449
Then why are you dumping my brother?

260
00:18:06,334 --> 00:18:09,201
Hey, big-- Spender!

261
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:13,401
She's still asleep.

262
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:16,274
So how'd it go?

263
00:18:16,274 --> 00:18:18,339
You know how you think you're great?

264
00:18:18,413 --> 00:18:22,406
The fact you'd even ask shows how little you know me.

265
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:27,450
Last night I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great.

266
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,316
So I had to do all this other stuff.

267
00:18:30,425 --> 00:18:33,326
And the response I got! Man, oh, man!

268
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:36,420
It was like a ticker-tape parade!

269
00:18:37,465 --> 00:18:42,425
I know. My room's very, very close to the parade route.

270
00:18:47,275 --> 00:18:50,438
It was amazing, and not just for her. For me too!

271
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:57,284
It's like, all of a sudden I'm blind but all my other senses are heightened.

273
00:18:57,385 --> 00:19:02,322
It's like I was able to appreciate it on another level.

275
00:19:05,226 --> 00:19:07,706
I didn't know you had another level.

276
00:19:07,706 --> 00:19:10,186
I know. Neither did I!

277
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:15,202
Is something going on with O.J.?

278
00:19:25,346 --> 00:19:28,213
Hey, great skirt. Birthday present?

279
00:19:28,249 --> 00:19:28,778
From who?

280
00:19:28,778 --> 00:19:29,307
You.

281
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,251
I exchanged the blouse you got me.

282
00:19:33,354 --> 00:19:35,219
Well, it's the thought.

283
00:19:35,523 --> 00:19:40,324
Doesn't Ross' flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27B?

284
00:19:41,462 --> 00:19:46,263
Yeah. Monica, you know, I've been thinking about it.

285
00:19:46,334 --> 00:19:49,428
I've decided this Ross thing is not a good idea.

286
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,459
Why?

287
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:54,436
I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him.

288
00:19:54,475 --> 00:19:58,434
I'd be going out with all of you. There'd be pressure--

289
00:19:58,546 --> 00:20:00,446
No pressure, no pressure!

290
00:20:02,383 --> 00:20:05,352
Nothing has happened, and you're already so--

291
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:12,483
I'm not ''so.'' Okay, I was a teensy bit weird at first but I'll be good. I promise.

293
00:20:17,498 --> 00:20:20,365
-Who is it?
-It's me, Carl.

294
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:21,918
Come on up.

295
00:20:21,918 --> 00:20:23,368
Behind my brother's back?

296
00:20:25,373 --> 00:20:30,367
Is the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.

297
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,937
Seven hundred bucks!

298
00:20:43,937 --> 00:20:45,484
All right, you did it!

299
00:20:45,526 --> 00:20:48,290
Do we have any fruit?

300
00:20:50,398 --> 00:20:52,389
Man, hell of a two weeks.

301
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,435
You know what? I feel I learned something.

302
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:58,404
You'll stick with this ''all for her'' thing?

303
00:20:58,439 --> 00:21:00,270
What are you, crazy?

304
00:21:00,441 --> 00:21:05,435
When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?

305
00:21:10,385 --> 00:21:18,485
If I see one more picture of Ed Begley Jr in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna shoot myself!

307
00:21:20,261 --> 00:21:25,459
I'm not against environmental issues, per se it's just that guy!

309
00:21:26,301 --> 00:21:30,260
I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.

310
00:21:30,471 --> 00:21:33,406
Excuse me, I'm trying to have a date here.

311
00:21:34,275 --> 00:21:37,267
Fine. Just stop thinking about me.

312
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,505
Can't do it, can you?

313
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:44,576
I'm thinking about you. So what?

314
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,380
I don't get it. What do you see in this guy?

315
00:21:49,424 --> 00:21:52,291
Happens to be a very nice guy.

316
00:21:52,327 --> 00:21:55,387
I mean, come on, buddy! Get a real car!

317
00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:02,233
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.

318
00:22:02,437 --> 00:22:04,337
Ross, it's too hard.

319
00:22:04,372 --> 00:22:09,275
Why, because it'll get weird for everyone else? This is about us.

320
00:22:09,377 --> 00:22:12,471
I've been in love with you since the ninth grade.

321
00:22:13,281 --> 00:22:17,479
You're like my best friend. If we broke up, and I lost you--

322
00:22:18,252 --> 00:22:19,480
What makes you think that?

323
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:24,349
Have you been involved where you haven't broken up?

324
00:22:26,394 --> 00:22:27,361
No.

325
00:22:28,363 --> 00:22:32,265
But it only has to happen once.

326
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:37,270
You and I both know we are perfect for each other. Right?

327
00:22:37,372 --> 00:22:41,468
So the only question is: Are you attracted to me?

328
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,478
I don't know.

329
00:22:46,381 --> 00:22:49,316
I mean, I've never looked at you that way before.

330
00:22:50,284 --> 00:22:51,410
Well, start looking.

331
00:23:02,363 --> 00:23:03,358
Wow.

332
00:23:03,358 --> 00:23:04,353
Exactly!

333
00:23:04,432 --> 00:23:10,261
And I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!

335
00:23:12,373 --> 00:23:15,240
Right! You're right.

336
00:23:16,244 --> 00:23:17,233
You know what?

337
00:23:17,278 --> 00:23:20,372
I'm supposed to pick up a friend at the airport.

338
00:23:20,448 --> 00:23:22,439
I am so sorry!

339
00:23:23,251 --> 00:23:26,277
If you wanna finish your drinks, please do.

340
00:23:26,387 --> 00:23:27,934
I'm sorry, I gotta go. I'm sorry.

341
00:23:27,934 --> 00:23:29,481
But....

342
00:23:35,363 --> 00:23:36,830
Where are you going?

343
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,297
To get Ross.

344
00:23:38,366 --> 00:23:39,412
My God, this is so exciting!

345
00:23:39,412 --> 00:23:40,458
I know.

346
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:45,365
If you want the rest of my date, I'm not gonna finish it.

347
00:23:45,473 --> 00:23:48,391
Rachel, he's not a sandwich.

348
00:23:48,391 --> 00:23:51,309
No, he's a banker with opera tickets.

349
00:23:52,413 --> 00:23:54,381
Hello!

350
00:23:57,585 --> 00:23:58,535
Where you going?

351
00:23:58,535 --> 00:23:59,485
Airport.

352
00:24:00,254 --> 00:24:03,314
You can't tell him. There's so much I haven't done.

353
00:24:03,357 --> 00:24:06,349
I haven't watched Baywatch with Yasmine Bleeth!

354
00:24:08,262 --> 00:24:12,221
Chandler, relax. This is a good going to the airport.

355
00:24:12,433 --> 00:24:16,335
Oh, well then fly, good woman, fly like the wind.

356
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,854
I'm flying!

357
00:24:17,854 --> 00:24:19,338
Tell him I'm the one who blew it!

358
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:25,444
Yes, another successful case for the love doctor.

359
00:24:34,255 --> 00:24:37,349
Excuse me! Pardon me. Excuse me. Sorry.

360
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:41,285
Toby, for God's sake, will you let it go?

361
00:24:41,395 --> 00:24:42,555
There's no Rachel!

362
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:50,503
Hey! I got that.

363
00:24:51,372 --> 00:24:52,384
Thanks, sweetie.

364
00:24:52,384 --> 00:24:53,396
No problem.

365
00:24:59,413 --> 00:25:02,246
I can't wait for you to meet my friends.

366
00:25:02,316 --> 00:25:05,217
You don't think they'll judge me?

367
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:06,769
No, they will. I just....

368
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:08,219
Can't wait!

369
00:25:08,322 --> 00:25:10,415
Come on, they're gonna love you.
