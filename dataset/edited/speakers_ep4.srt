1
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:07,897
Phoebe: If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want world peace no hunger, good things for the rain forest.

3
01:00:08,909 --> 01:00:10,706
Phoebe: And bigger boobs.

4
01:00:11,846 --> 01:00:14,815
Ross: Well, see, you took mine.

5
01:00:15,749 --> 01:00:16,738
Ross: What about you?

6
01:00:16,851 --> 01:00:21,811
Chandler: If I were omnipotent for a day, I'd make myself omnipotent forever.

7
01:00:21,922 --> 01:00:26,916
Rachel: There's always one guy. ''If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes.''

8
01:00:28,863 --> 01:00:29,955
All: Hey, Joey.

9
01:00:30,764 --> 01:00:33,028
Monica: What would you do if you were omnipotent?

10
01:00:33,767 --> 01:00:35,758
Joey: Probably kill myself.

11
01:00:36,871 --> 01:00:37,929
Monica: Excuse me?

12
01:00:37,972 --> 01:00:41,874
Joey: If little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live.

13
01:00:43,878 --> 01:00:46,972
Ross: Joey, omnipotent.

14
01:00:47,882 --> 01:00:49,850
Joey: You are?

15
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:55,820
Joey: Ross, I'm sorry. I had no idea. I thought it was a theoretical question.

16
01:00:56,824 --> 01:00:58,883
The One With the George Stephanopoulos

17
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:47,874
Monica: How does she do that?

18
01:01:47,942 --> 01:01:50,740
Ross: I can't sleep in a public place.

19
01:01:50,844 --> 01:01:52,971
Libraries, airplanes, movie theaters....

20
01:01:53,781 --> 01:01:55,715
You slept at the Grand Canyon.

21
01:01:55,783 --> 01:01:59,776
Hello, Mom and Dad never took us to the Grand Canyon.

22
01:02:00,788 --> 01:02:02,915
Mom and Dad took us to the Grand Canyon?

23
01:02:04,692 --> 01:02:07,786
Monica: Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.

24
01:02:07,861 --> 01:02:08,919
Yeah.

25
01:02:09,863 --> 01:02:11,831
Phoebe: What? What? What?

26
01:02:11,899 --> 01:02:13,912
Phoebe: Hi.

27
01:02:13,912 --> 01:02:15,925
Ross: It's okay. You just nodded off again.

28
01:02:16,737 --> 01:02:17,726
Monica: What's going on?

29
01:02:17,805 --> 01:02:28,704
Phoebe: I got no sleep last night. My grandmother has a new boyfriend and they're both kind of insecure in bed, so-- And deaf.

31
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:33,852
Phoebe: They reassure each other that they're having a good time.

32
01:02:33,921 --> 01:02:37,755
Phoebe: You have no idea how loud they are.

33
01:02:38,726 --> 01:02:40,273
Monica: You can stay with Rachel and me.

34
01:02:40,273 --> 01:02:41,820
Phoebe: Thanks.

35
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:44,921
Joey: --95, 96, 97. See, I told you.

36
01:02:45,733 --> 01:02:48,031
Joey: Less than 100 steps from our place to here.

37
01:02:48,769 --> 01:02:51,761
Chandler: You got way too much free time, man.

38
01:02:51,872 --> 01:02:54,739
Joey: There's the birthday boy.

39
01:02:54,842 --> 01:02:58,903
Joey: Hockey tickets. Rangers-Penguins tonight and we're taking you.

40
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,193
Chandler: Happy birthday, pal!

41
01:03:01,193 --> 01:03:02,706
Joey: We love you, man.

42
01:03:03,784 --> 01:03:06,878
Ross: It's funny. My birthday was seven months ago.

43
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,353
Joey: So?

44
01:03:08,353 --> 01:03:12,984
Ross: So you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide who got to bring a date?

46
01:03:13,727 --> 01:03:16,924
Chandler: Well, aren't we Mr. The-Glass-ls-Half-Empty?

47
01:03:17,698 --> 01:03:21,691
Ross: Oh, my God! Is today the 20th? October 20th?

48
01:03:21,735 --> 01:03:23,765
Monica: I hoped you wouldn't remember.

49
01:03:23,765 --> 01:03:25,795
Joey: What's wrong with the 20th?

50
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:30,708
Chandler: Eleven days before Halloween. All the good costumes are gone?

51
01:03:30,811 --> 01:03:39,717
Ross: Today's the day Carol and I first consummated our physical relationship.

54
01:03:39,953 --> 01:03:41,921
Ross: Sex.

55
01:03:44,825 --> 01:03:47,276
You told your sister that?

56
01:03:47,276 --> 01:03:49,727
Believe me, I told everyone.

57
01:03:49,930 --> 01:03:51,830
Ross: I better pass on the game.

58
01:03:51,932 --> 01:03:56,892
Ross: I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.

59
01:03:57,871 --> 01:04:00,863
Joey: The hell with hockey! Let's all do that!

60
01:04:02,776 --> 01:04:06,678
Chandler: Come on, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice! Guys' night out!

61
01:04:06,714 --> 01:04:08,875
Chandler: Come on, what do you say, big guy?

62
01:04:08,916 --> 01:04:10,349
Ross: What are you doing?

63
01:04:10,349 --> 01:04:11,782
Chandler: I have no idea.

64
01:04:11,885 --> 01:04:14,285
Joey: Come on, Ross.

65
01:04:14,285 --> 01:04:16,685
Ross: Maybe it will take my mind off it.

66
01:04:16,724 --> 01:04:18,254
Ross: Promise to buy me a big foam finger?

67
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:19,784
Chandler: You got it.

68
01:04:19,893 --> 01:04:22,828
Rachel: Look, look, look! My first paycheck!

69
01:04:22,896 --> 01:04:27,799
Rachel: Look at the window! There's my name! Hi, me!

70
01:04:28,702 --> 01:04:30,829
Phoebe: I remember when I got my first paycheck.

71
01:04:30,904 --> 01:04:34,931
Phoebe: There was a cave-in in a mine, and eight people were killed.

72
01:04:36,744 --> 01:04:38,843
Monica: You worked in a mine?

73
01:04:38,843 --> 01:04:40,942
Phoebe: No, I worked at a Dairy Queen. Why?

74
01:04:43,951 --> 01:04:49,821
Rachel: Isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it. I steamed milk.

75
01:04:49,857 --> 01:04:54,723
Rachel: And it was totally not worth it.

77
01:04:54,828 --> 01:04:58,696
Rachel: What's FICA? Why's he getting all my money?

78
01:04:59,666 --> 01:05:02,794
Rachel: I mean, what--? Chandler, look at that.

79
01:05:03,670 --> 01:05:05,763
Chandler: This is not that bad.

80
01:05:05,806 --> 01:05:08,775
Joey: You're fine, yeah, for a first job.

81
01:05:08,809 --> 01:05:11,710
Ross: You can totally, totally live on this.

82
01:05:11,779 --> 01:05:13,872
Monica: Oh, yeah. Yeah.

83
01:05:13,914 --> 01:05:15,910
Ross: By the way, great service today.

84
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:17,906
All: Yeah.

85
01:05:21,789 --> 01:05:22,852
Guys: Hockey!

86
01:05:22,852 --> 01:05:23,915
Guys: Hockey!

87
01:05:34,902 --> 01:05:36,301
Guys: Hockey!

88
01:05:36,301 --> 01:05:37,700
Guys: Hockey.

89
01:05:38,906 --> 01:05:40,897
Leslie: Rachel?

90
01:05:41,909 --> 01:05:44,707
Rachel: Oh, my God!

91
01:05:48,949 --> 01:05:53,716
Monica: I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.

92
01:05:53,754 --> 01:05:54,948
Rachel: What are you doing here?

93
01:05:55,689 --> 01:06:00,888
Kiki: We were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, and it's true!

94
01:06:02,896 --> 01:06:07,765
Joanne: Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play.

95
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:12,864
Rachel: God, look at you! You're so big! I can't believe it!

96
01:06:12,973 --> 01:06:16,807
Leslie: I know, I know! I'm a duplex.

97
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:22,780
Kiki, you look phenomenal. I mean, you've lost, like, a ton of weight.

98
01:06:22,883 --> 01:06:28,985
And you should really, really-- It's time to stop, you look perfect.

100
01:06:29,723 --> 01:06:30,883
Rachel: What's going on?

101
01:06:30,924 --> 01:06:34,985
Joanne: Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm?

102
01:06:38,699 --> 01:06:40,997
Kiki: And while we're on the subject of news....

103
01:06:44,705 --> 01:06:46,900
Phoebe: Look, look! I have elbows!

104
01:06:51,945 --> 01:06:54,812
Chandler: --Passes it up to Leetch.

105
01:06:54,915 --> 01:06:57,884
Joey: Leetch spots Messier. Here's the pass!

106
01:06:59,653 --> 01:07:03,783
Chandler: We'll take a time-out while Messier looks at some women's shoes.

107
01:07:03,857 --> 01:07:08,851
Ross: Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we first....

108
01:07:08,896 --> 01:07:11,956
Ross: You know? In fact, she....

109
01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:14,758
Ross: She never took them off.

110
01:07:14,801 --> 01:07:17,895
Ross: It's because we-- Sorry, sorry.

111
01:07:18,705 --> 01:07:21,799
I can't believe--

112
01:07:22,809 --> 01:07:23,838
Joey: What?

113
01:07:23,838 --> 01:07:24,867
Ross: Peach pit.

114
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:27,670
Chandler: Yes, bunny?

115
01:07:27,881 --> 01:07:31,681
Ross: Peach pit. That night, we had--

116
01:07:31,785 --> 01:07:33,781
Joey: Peaches?

117
01:07:33,781 --> 01:07:35,777
Ross: Actually, nectarines but....

118
01:07:35,822 --> 01:07:37,687
Chandler: Could've been a peach.

119
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:46,928
Ross: Then we-- Then we got dressed and I walked her to the bus stop. I'm fine.

121
01:07:47,935 --> 01:07:50,927
Joey: Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's.

122
01:07:54,942 --> 01:07:58,639
Joey: What? I thought we were trying to find stuff.

123
01:07:58,946 --> 01:08:01,779
Rachel: Come on, you guys. Tell me all the dirt.

124
01:08:01,848 --> 01:08:06,842
Kiki: Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar.

125
01:08:07,955 --> 01:08:09,906
Joanne: Let's talk reality for a second.

126
01:08:09,906 --> 01:08:11,857
Rachel: Okay.

127
01:08:11,892 --> 01:08:14,275
Joanne: When are you coming home?

128
01:08:14,275 --> 01:08:16,658
Rachel: What? Guys, I'm not.

129
01:08:16,763 --> 01:08:18,714
Joanne: Come on. This is us.

130
01:08:18,714 --> 01:08:20,665
Rachel: I'm not.

131
01:08:20,701 --> 01:08:24,694
Rachel: This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job.

132
01:08:24,805 --> 01:08:27,865
I even do my own laundry.

133
01:08:31,878 --> 01:08:33,408
Rachel: This is what I'm doing now.

134
01:08:33,408 --> 01:08:34,938
Kiki: Waitressing?

135
01:08:35,716 --> 01:08:41,712
Kiki: I'm not just waitressing. I mean, I'm....

136
01:08:41,788 --> 01:08:47,727
Rachel: I write the specials on the specials board.

137
01:08:47,828 --> 01:08:51,821
Rachel: And I take the dead flowers out of the vase.

138
01:08:51,898 --> 01:08:56,835
Rachel: Sometimes Arturo lets me put the chocolate blobbies on the cookies.

139
01:08:56,870 --> 01:09:01,637
Leslie: Well, your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.

140
01:09:11,651 --> 01:09:14,643
Monica: Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?

141
01:09:17,758 --> 01:09:20,784
Monica: Okay, how would you like some Tiki Death punch?

142
01:09:20,861 --> 01:09:22,277
Rachel: What's that?

143
01:09:22,277 --> 01:09:23,693
Monica: Well, it's rum and--

144
01:09:23,797 --> 01:09:25,697
Rachel: Okay.

145
01:09:27,667 --> 01:09:30,864
Monica: Since Phoebe's staying, we'll have a slumber party.

146
01:09:30,971 --> 01:09:35,704
Monica: We got trashy magazines. We got cookie dough. We got Twister.

147
01:09:36,676 --> 01:09:41,807
Phoebe: And I brought Operation. But I lost the tweezers so we can't operate.

148
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:44,876
Phoebe: But we can prep the guy.

149
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:49,271
Monica: Rach, it's the Visa card people.

150
01:09:49,271 --> 01:09:51,722
Rachel: Oh, God. Ask them what they want.

151
01:09:51,792 --> 01:09:55,694
Monica: Could you please tell me what this is in reference to?

152
01:09:55,929 --> 01:09:59,797
Monica: There's been unusual activity on your account.

153
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:01,925
Rachel: I haven't used my card in weeks.

154
01:10:02,736 --> 01:10:04,897
Monica: That is the unusual activity.

155
01:10:05,939 --> 01:10:08,806
Monica: They wanna see if you're okay.

156
01:10:08,842 --> 01:10:12,835
Monica: They wanna know if I'm okay? Okay, let's see.

157
01:10:12,913 --> 01:10:16,849
Rachel: Well, let's see. The FICA guys took all my money.

158
01:10:16,917 --> 01:10:20,819
Rachel: Everyone is getting married or pregnant or promoted.

159
01:10:20,854 --> 01:10:24,915
Rachel: And I'm getting coffee. And it's not even for me!

160
01:10:24,958 --> 01:10:29,759
Rachel: If that sounds like I'm okay, then tell them I'm okay. Okay?

161
01:10:31,731 --> 01:10:36,828
Monica: Rachel has left the building. Can you call back?

162
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:39,771
Rachel: All right! Come on!

163
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:42,841
Rachel: Let's play Twister!

164
01:10:50,851 --> 01:10:53,319
Ross: Sorry.

165
01:10:53,319 --> 01:10:55,787
Ross: Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

166
01:10:55,822 --> 01:10:59,781
Chandler: There was ice that night with Carol? Plastic seats?

167
01:10:59,826 --> 01:11:02,818
Chandler: Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?

168
01:11:03,797 --> 01:11:06,925
Ross: No, I was just saying we're not sitting together.

169
01:11:07,734 --> 01:11:10,999
Ross: But now that you mention it, there was ice that night.

170
01:11:11,805 --> 01:11:14,797
Ross: It was the first frost.

171
01:11:14,841 --> 01:11:16,934
Joey: Sit. Just sit down. Sit.

172
01:11:17,711 --> 01:11:20,839
Monica: You're doing this amazing independent thing.

173
01:11:20,947 --> 01:11:23,711
Rachel: Monica, what is so amazing?

174
01:11:23,817 --> 01:11:27,844
Rachel: I gave up, like, everything. And for what?

175
01:11:27,921 --> 01:11:29,838
Phoebe: You are just like Jack.

176
01:11:29,838 --> 01:11:31,755
Rachel: Jack from downstairs?

177
01:11:32,025 --> 01:11:34,960
Phoebe: No, Jack and the Beanstalk.

178
01:11:35,829 --> 01:11:37,729
Monica: Ah, the other Jack.

179
01:11:37,764 --> 01:11:41,928
Phoebe: Right. He gave up something but then he got those magic beans.

180
01:11:41,968 --> 01:11:49,968
Phoebe: And then he woke up and there was this big plant outside of his window, full of possibilities.

182
01:11:50,777 --> 01:11:53,871
Phoebe: He lived in a village, and you live in the Village.

183
01:11:53,947 --> 01:12:00,682
Rachel: Okay. But, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow. I gave up an orthodontist.

184
01:12:00,787 --> 01:12:03,301
Rachel: Okay, I know I didn't love him....

185
01:12:03,301 --> 01:12:05,815
Phoebe: Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.

186
01:12:06,693 --> 01:12:09,685
Rachel: But, see, it was a plan. It was clear.

187
01:12:09,796 --> 01:12:12,731
Rachel: Everything was figured out. Now it's like....

188
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,794
Phoebe: Floopy?

189
01:12:13,794 --> 01:12:14,789
Rachel: Yeah.

190
01:12:15,936 --> 01:12:19,702
Monica: We don't know where we're going.

191
01:12:19,739 --> 01:12:24,836
Monica: It's all gonna come together and it's just gonna be un-floopy.

192
01:12:24,945 --> 01:12:27,709
Phoebe: Yeah, like that's a word.

193
01:12:29,916 --> 01:12:34,717
Rachel: Okay. But Monica, what if it doesn't come together?

194
01:12:35,755 --> 01:12:36,949
Monica: Pheebs?

195
01:12:37,958 --> 01:12:41,917
Phoebe: Well, because you just-- I don't like this question.

196
01:12:42,829 --> 01:12:46,731
Rachel: See, you guys? What if we don't get magic beans?

197
01:12:46,833 --> 01:12:51,736
Rachel: I mean, what if all we've got are beans?

198
01:12:54,841 --> 01:12:57,867
Ross: Get him! Get him! Get him!

199
01:12:57,978 --> 01:13:00,879
Ross: Yes! You're not laughing now, are you, pal?

200
01:13:01,681 --> 01:13:05,674
Chandler: All you needed were guys hitting each other with sticks.

201
01:13:05,719 --> 01:13:07,812
Ross: Pass it! Pass it!

202
01:13:07,887 --> 01:13:10,338
Chandler: He's open! He's open!

203
01:13:10,338 --> 01:13:12,789
All: Shoot it! Shoot it!

204
01:13:17,797 --> 01:13:20,698
Chandler: Hey, look, we're on that TV thing.

205
01:13:31,711 --> 01:13:32,837
Chandler: Excuse me?

206
01:13:32,912 --> 01:13:37,713
Receptionist: It says to call if you're not satisfied with this candy bar.

207
01:13:37,751 --> 01:13:40,811
Receptionist: Well, I'm not completely satisfied.

208
01:13:42,756 --> 01:13:45,748
Well, the label promises nutty goodness.

209
01:13:46,726 --> 01:13:50,958
Chandler: It's an emergency. But you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.

210
01:13:53,767 --> 01:13:56,759
Receptionist: Hold on. Fill these out. Sit over there!

211
01:13:56,870 --> 01:14:00,863
Ross: I don't want to make any trouble but I'm in a lot of pain.

212
01:14:00,974 --> 01:14:03,340
Ross: My face is dented.

213
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:05,706
Receptionist: Well, you'll have to wait your turn.

214
01:14:05,779 --> 01:14:08,276
Joey: How long do you think it will be?

215
01:14:08,276 --> 01:14:10,773
Receptionist: Any minute now.

216
01:14:12,886 --> 01:14:14,877
Ross: Hey, this--

217
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:31,701
Rachel: I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.

218
01:14:31,738 --> 01:14:36,835
Monica: No, you were right. I don't have a plan.

219
01:14:38,912 --> 01:14:40,812
Pizza Guy: Pizza guy.

220
01:14:40,812 --> 01:14:42,712
Rachel: Food!

221
01:14:42,749 --> 01:14:43,778
Monica: Phoebe?

222
01:14:43,778 --> 01:14:44,807
Phoebe: What?

223
01:14:44,851 --> 01:14:46,881
Monica: Do you have a plan?

224
01:14:46,881 --> 01:14:48,911
Phoebe: I don't even have a ''pla.''

225
01:14:51,758 --> 01:14:53,919
Pizza Guy: One mushroom, green pepper and onion?

226
01:14:54,728 --> 01:14:57,856
Rachel: No, no, no. That's not what we ordered!

227
01:14:58,665 --> 01:15:01,964
Rachel: We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese!

228
01:15:04,871 --> 01:15:09,672
Pizza Guy: Wait. You're not G. Stephanopoulos? Man, my dad's gonna kill me!

229
01:15:09,776 --> 01:15:13,803
Monica: Wait! Did you say G. Stephanopoulos?

230
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:18,874
Pizza Guy: Yeah, this one goes across the street. I gave him yours. Bonehead! Bonehead!

231
01:15:19,686 --> 01:15:22,883
When you do that, you're only hitting yourself.

232
01:15:24,924 --> 01:15:30,885
Monica: Was this a small Mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?

233
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:32,926
Pizza Guy: That sounds right.

234
01:15:32,926 --> 01:15:34,922
Monica: Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?

235
01:15:35,735 --> 01:15:37,367
Phoebe: And a power tie?

236
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:38,999
Pizza Guy: No, pretty much just a towel.

237
01:15:39,739 --> 01:15:41,735
Monica: Oh, God!

238
01:15:41,735 --> 01:15:43,731
Pizza Guy: You guys want me to take this back?

239
01:15:43,843 --> 01:15:48,746
Monica: What, are you nuts? We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!

240
01:15:51,951 --> 01:15:56,752
Rachel: Pheebs, who's George Snuffleupagus?

241
01:15:58,691 --> 01:16:00,852
Phoebe: That's Big Bird's friend.

242
01:16:02,796 --> 01:16:04,343
Monica: I see pizza!

243
01:16:04,343 --> 01:16:05,890
Phoebe: I want to see. Let me see.

244
01:16:06,666 --> 01:16:08,657
Rachel: Hello! Who are we spying on?

245
01:16:08,768 --> 01:16:11,760
Monica: White House adviser, Clinton's campaign guy.

246
01:16:11,871 --> 01:16:15,671
Monica: The one with the great hair, sexy smile, cute butt.

247
01:16:15,775 --> 01:16:19,711
Rachel: Oh, him! The little guy. Oh, I love him!

248
01:16:19,813 --> 01:16:22,395
Phoebe: Wait. Wait, I see a woman.

249
01:16:22,395 --> 01:16:24,977
Monica: Tell me it's his mother.

250
01:16:25,718 --> 01:16:26,815
Phoebe: Definitely not his mother.

251
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:27,912
Monica: Oh, no!

252
01:16:28,688 --> 01:16:32,886
Phoebe: Wait, she's walking across the floor. She's walking, she's walking....

253
01:16:32,926 --> 01:16:36,885
Phoebe: She's going for the pizza-- That's not for you, bitch!

254
01:16:51,911 --> 01:16:56,780
Chandler: We've been here for over an hour, and people less sick have gone in.

255
01:16:56,883 --> 01:17:00,751
Chandler: That guy with the toe thing, who's he sleeping with?

256
01:17:03,690 --> 01:17:06,659
Chandler: Oh, come on, Dora. Don't be mad.

257
01:17:06,726 --> 01:17:14,861
Chandler: I know we both said some things...we didn't mean but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.

259
01:17:15,668 --> 01:17:18,796
Chandler: You know, I feel like I've lost her.

260
01:17:22,675 --> 01:17:23,670
Come on, push me.

261
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:24,665
No.

262
01:17:24,744 --> 01:17:25,824
Push me.

263
01:17:25,824 --> 01:17:26,904
We're gonna get in trouble.

264
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:29,773
Don't be a baby. Push me. Push me.

265
01:17:29,883 --> 01:17:35,685
All right. I'm gonna push you, okay? How about I push you like this?

266
01:17:36,923 --> 01:17:42,884
Now you're gonna be in a wheelchair the rest of your life, pally-wally....

267
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:50,701
I am so very sorry. Can I sign you?

268
01:17:52,839 --> 01:17:53,823
Monica: Lights still out?

269
01:17:53,823 --> 01:17:54,807
Rachel: Yeah.

270
01:17:54,908 --> 01:17:57,775
Monica: Well, maybe they're napping.

271
01:17:57,844 --> 01:18:00,261
Rachel: Please. They're having sex.

272
01:18:00,261 --> 01:18:02,678
Monica and Phoebe: Shut up!

273
01:18:05,652 --> 01:18:09,850
Rachel: So, what do you think George is like?

274
01:18:09,889 --> 01:18:11,288
Monica: I think he's shy.

275
01:18:11,288 --> 01:18:12,687
Phoebe: Yeah.

276
01:18:12,759 --> 01:18:15,751
Monica: Yeah. I think you have to draw him out.

277
01:18:15,795 --> 01:18:20,789
Monica: And then when you do, he's a preppy animal.

278
01:18:21,801 --> 01:18:23,285
Joey: What do you think of the guys?

279
01:18:23,285 --> 01:18:24,769
Our guys?

280
01:18:24,871 --> 01:18:26,771
Yeah, our guys.

281
01:18:26,771 --> 01:18:28,671
I feel funny talking about that.

282
01:18:28,775 --> 01:18:30,288
Oh, come on.

283
01:18:30,288 --> 01:18:31,801
Okay. Well....

284
01:18:31,878 --> 01:18:34,779
Ross: I think Joey's like a little kiddie ride.

285
01:18:34,881 --> 01:18:38,977
You just have to put the quarter in and it just goes.

286
01:18:40,787 --> 01:18:47,792
He might surprise you. One time, he helped me put on my coat and he was really tender.

288
01:18:47,894 --> 01:18:52,695
Come on, baby, come on. Let's go.

289
01:18:52,799 --> 01:18:54,733
Yes!

290
01:18:55,735 --> 01:19:00,638
Chandler's one of those repressed guys who you'd have to seduce.

291
01:19:00,673 --> 01:19:05,633
I think it's an act. Chandler is more sophisticated than he seems.

292
01:19:10,750 --> 01:19:11,847
You know who's kind of sexy?

293
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:12,944
Don't.

294
01:19:13,686 --> 01:19:15,267
Ross.

295
01:19:15,267 --> 01:19:16,848
No, guys. Please, he is my brother.

296
01:19:16,889 --> 01:19:20,791
I know exactly what you mean. He can be really smooth.

297
01:19:31,904 --> 01:19:34,805
Can't you just picture him in bed?

298
01:19:34,874 --> 01:19:36,967
I really don't want to.

299
01:19:38,778 --> 01:19:40,712
Come on, laugh. Laugh.

300
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:47,816
I remember the moonlight coming in the window, and her face had the most incredible glow.

302
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:51,879
The moon, the glow, the magical feeling. You did this.

303
01:19:52,692 --> 01:19:55,786
Could I get some painkillers over here, please?

304
01:19:55,895 --> 01:19:59,831
He's right. Enough. What's the big deal about today?

305
01:19:59,899 --> 01:20:02,834
Ross: So you slept with her for the first time.

306
01:20:02,902 --> 01:20:05,928
You slept with her for seven years after that.

307
01:20:06,839 --> 01:20:08,932
It's a little more complicated--

308
01:20:09,742 --> 01:20:13,940
What is it, that she left you for another woman that likes women?

309
01:20:14,714 --> 01:20:19,845
Louder. There's a man on the 1 2th floor in a coma who didn't hear you.

310
01:20:22,722 --> 01:20:23,746
Joey: Then, what?

311
01:20:24,824 --> 01:20:29,921
Ross: My first time with Carol was was my....

313
01:20:30,930 --> 01:20:31,954
Joey: What?

314
01:20:34,834 --> 01:20:39,828
It was my first time.

315
01:20:39,972 --> 01:20:41,940
With Carol?

316
01:20:46,846 --> 01:20:47,938
Monica: Oh.

317
01:20:48,881 --> 01:20:52,749
So, in your whole life, you've only been with one--?

318
01:20:53,953 --> 01:20:57,821
Oh, boy. Hockey was a big mistake.

319
01:20:58,691 --> 01:21:01,819
There's a bunch of stuff we could've done tonight.

320
01:21:03,730 --> 01:21:05,789
Monica: Okay, I got one.

321
01:21:05,898 --> 01:21:12,694
Monica: Do you remember that vegetarian pâté that I made that you loved so much?

323
01:21:13,706 --> 01:21:16,937
Monica: Well, unless goose is a vegetable--!

324
01:21:19,912 --> 01:21:23,939
Phoebe: Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.

325
01:21:24,751 --> 01:21:26,730
Monica: What? You slept with Jason?

326
01:21:26,730 --> 01:21:28,709
Phoebe: You had already broken up.

327
01:21:28,821 --> 01:21:29,867
Rachel: How long?

328
01:21:29,867 --> 01:21:30,913
Phoebe: Just a couple hours.

329
01:21:31,724 --> 01:21:33,823
Monica: Oh, that's nice!

330
01:21:33,823 --> 01:21:35,922
Rachel: Okay, okay, okay, I got one!

331
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:42,924
Rachel: Anyway, the valentine Tom left in your locker was really from me!

332
01:21:43,836 --> 01:21:45,770
Monica: Excuse me?

333
01:21:45,838 --> 01:21:49,968
Rachel: Hello! Like he was really gonna send you one.

334
01:21:51,744 --> 01:21:54,838
Rachel: She was a big girl!

335
01:21:55,715 --> 01:22:01,711
Monica: Really? Well, at least big girls don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!

336
01:22:01,821 --> 01:22:04,790
Rachel: I was laughing. You made me laugh!

337
01:22:04,824 --> 01:22:07,691
Phoebe: Oh, my God! There he is! There he is!

338
01:22:07,794 --> 01:22:09,341
Monica: Where?

339
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:10,888
Phoebe: Where we've been looking all night.

340
01:22:11,697 --> 01:22:13,193
Rachel: He's so cute.

341
01:22:13,193 --> 01:22:14,689
Monica: George, baby, drop the towel.

342
01:22:14,801 --> 01:22:16,849
Monica: Come on, drop the towel.

343
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:18,897
All: Drop it. Will you please drop it?

344
01:22:19,005 --> 01:22:21,701
Wow!

345
01:22:23,943 --> 01:22:28,937
Joey: Man, can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?

346
01:22:29,916 --> 01:22:33,909
Chandler: I think it's great. You know, it's sweet.

347
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:36,011
Chandler: It's romantic.

348
01:22:36,923 --> 01:22:37,947
Joey: Really?

349
01:22:38,724 --> 01:22:41,818
Chandler: You kidding? The guy's a freak. I judge him.

350
01:22:41,861 --> 01:22:42,845
Both: Hey, man!

351
01:22:42,845 --> 01:22:43,829
Both: Hey, buddy!

352
01:22:47,767 --> 01:22:51,760
Receptionist: Oh, that's attractive.

353
01:22:52,872 --> 01:22:56,672
Chandler: I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs.

354
01:22:57,910 --> 01:23:01,778
Chandler: Admit it, all things considered, you had fun tonight.

355
01:23:01,881 --> 01:23:05,715
Ross: Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me which part was fun.

356
01:23:05,818 --> 01:23:06,910
Ross: Where's my puck?

357
01:23:07,687 --> 01:23:09,183
Joey: The kid has it.

358
01:23:09,183 --> 01:23:10,679
Ross: The kid--

359
01:23:11,691 --> 01:23:13,886
Ross: Excuse me, that's my puck.

360
01:23:14,694 --> 01:23:18,790
Kid: I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.

361
01:23:21,701 --> 01:23:22,998
Chandler: You gotta do it, man.

362
01:23:24,003 --> 01:23:26,938
Ross: I'm rubber, you're glue. Whatever you--

363
01:23:27,707 --> 01:23:28,935
Ross: I can't do it.

364
01:23:29,742 --> 01:23:30,839
Ross: Listen, give me back my puck.

365
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:31,936
Kid: No.

366
01:23:32,712 --> 01:23:33,309
Ross: Yes, how about--?

367
01:23:33,309 --> 01:23:33,906
Kid: No.

368
01:23:33,946 --> 01:23:34,930
Give me my puck.

369
01:23:34,930 --> 01:23:35,914
Kid: No.

370
01:23:35,948 --> 01:23:37,916
Receptionist: No roughhousing in my ER!

371
01:23:38,718 --> 01:23:40,845
Give me my puck!

372
01:23:45,725 --> 01:23:47,920
Ross: Now that was fun.

373
01:23:53,766 --> 01:23:57,862
Ross: Okay, Monica. Right foot, red.

374
01:23:57,904 --> 01:24:01,863
Monica: We could've played Monopoly, but no!

375
01:24:07,813 --> 01:24:09,713
Chandler: Thanks.

376
01:24:14,921 --> 01:24:19,722
Ross: Okay, Pheebs. Right hand, blue.

377
01:24:26,732 --> 01:24:30,725
Ross, switch with me and Phoebe could be number two.

378
01:24:31,938 --> 01:24:36,898
Nothing. It's a Twister thing. The rules are on the back of the box.

379
01:24:39,745 --> 01:24:40,939
Chandler: Hello?

380
01:24:41,747 --> 01:24:43,715
Chandler: It's the Visa card people.

381
01:24:43,816 --> 01:24:45,784
Rachel: Okay. Will you take my place?

382
01:24:45,784 --> 01:24:47,752
Chandler: All right. This is Rachel.

383
01:24:47,853 --> 01:24:49,753
Rachel: No!

384
01:24:51,824 --> 01:24:56,852
Rachel: Hello? Oh, yeah. No, I know. I haven't been using it much.

385
01:24:56,896 --> 01:25:00,662
Rachel: Oh, well, thanks. But I'm okay, really.

386
01:25:00,766 --> 01:25:01,812
Ross: To the green.

387
01:25:01,812 --> 01:25:02,858
Oh, no.

388
01:25:02,969 --> 01:25:05,870
Rachel: I've got magic beans.

389
01:25:07,907 --> 01:25:09,807
Rachel: No, no, never mind.

390
01:25:09,875 --> 01:25:12,776
Chandler: To the left! To the left!

391
01:25:12,878 --> 01:25:15,870
Rachel: I'm fine.
