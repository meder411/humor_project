1
00:00:03,247 --> 00:00:04,236
Coffee.

2
00:00:04,415 --> 00:00:05,427
Thank you.

3
00:00:05,427 --> 00:00:06,439
Cappuccino.

4
00:00:08,252 --> 00:00:11,221
And a nice, hot cider for Monica.

5
00:00:11,322 --> 00:00:13,222
Thank you.

6
00:00:13,358 --> 00:00:17,260
Rach, why does my cinnamon stick have an eraser?

7
00:00:21,332 --> 00:00:22,458
That's why.

8
00:00:23,468 --> 00:00:25,265
Sorry.

9
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:23,318
Chandler?

10
00:01:24,362 --> 00:01:26,421
Miss Tedlock, you look lovely today.

11
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:30,359
That is a very flattering sleeve length on you.

12
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,363
Mr. Costilick would like you to stop by his office today.

13
00:01:37,341 --> 00:01:41,243
If it's about those prank memos, I wasn't involved.

14
00:01:41,345 --> 00:01:43,279
Nothing at all. Really.

15
00:01:45,483 --> 00:01:51,353
And frankly, those shenanigans have no place in an office environment.

16
00:01:57,395 --> 00:01:58,555
Hey, you guys!

17
00:01:59,297 --> 00:02:01,492
Chandler's coming and he has incredible news.

18
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,394
So when he gets here, let's all act, like, you know--

19
00:02:06,304 --> 00:02:09,239
Never mind. But it was gonna be really good.

20
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:11,333
What's going on?

21
00:02:11,442 --> 00:02:19,406
So it's a typical day at work and Big AI tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.

23
00:02:20,218 --> 00:02:21,213
That is great!

24
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:22,208
Congratulations!

25
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,311
So I quit.

26
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:26,315
Why?

27
00:02:26,357 --> 00:02:28,416
Why? This was a temp job.

28
00:02:29,227 --> 00:02:31,422
Chandler, you've been there for five years.

29
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,257
I know, but if I took it, I'd be admitting that this is what I do.

30
00:02:36,334 --> 00:02:41,328
Does that mean we have to start buying our own toilet paper?

31
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,239
That was Joey Tribbiani with the big picture. Dan?

32
00:02:45,443 --> 00:02:47,240
Was it more money?

33
00:02:47,345 --> 00:02:54,241
Doesn't matter. I just don't want to be a guy who sits in his office worrying about the WENUS.

35
00:02:56,454 --> 00:02:57,478
The ''WENUS''?

36
00:02:58,356 --> 00:03:02,190
Weekly estimated net usage system. It's a processing term.

37
00:03:02,426 --> 00:03:04,394
Oh, that WENUS.

38
00:03:06,297 --> 00:03:07,286
What will you do?

39
00:03:07,398 --> 00:03:12,199
I don't know. But I won't figure it out working there.

40
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:14,295
I have something you can do!

41
00:03:14,405 --> 00:03:17,499
I have this new massage client, Steve.

42
00:03:18,342 --> 00:03:23,439
Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.

44
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:27,884
Hi, there.

45
00:03:27,884 --> 00:03:29,351
Hi.

46
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,254
I know. You're a chef and I thought of you first.

47
00:03:33,357 --> 00:03:37,225
But Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....

48
00:03:38,429 --> 00:03:41,364
I just don't have a lot of chef-ing experience.

49
00:03:41,465 --> 00:03:44,457
Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.

50
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:47,437
What is he looking for?

51
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,264
He wants to do something eclectic.

52
00:03:50,341 --> 00:03:54,471
He's looking for someone who can create the entire menu.

53
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:56,541
So, what do you think?

54
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:01,475
Thanks. I just don't see myself in a big, white hat.

55
00:04:05,223 --> 00:04:07,384
Oh, Monica! Guess what?

56
00:04:10,194 --> 00:04:14,187
--a perfect run-up and there he goes, a perfect....

57
00:04:14,298 --> 00:04:19,397
Watch stuff like this and you realize why evolution is just a theory.

59
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:28,406
Can you see my nipples through this shirt?

60
00:04:28,446 --> 00:04:33,247
No, but don't worry. I'm sure they're still there.

61
00:04:33,317 --> 00:04:34,443
Where are you going?

62
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:41,215
I have an appointment with Dr. Robert Pilman, career counselor-a-go-go!

63
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:42,955
I added the ''a-go-go.''

64
00:04:42,955 --> 00:04:44,451
Career counselor?

65
00:04:45,263 --> 00:04:48,232
You guys all know what you want to do.

66
00:04:48,332 --> 00:04:49,356
I don't.

67
00:04:50,268 --> 00:04:53,465
You guys in the living room all know what you want to do.

68
00:04:54,238 --> 00:04:57,435
You have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream!

69
00:04:58,242 --> 00:05:01,268
The lesser-known ''I Don't Have a Dream'' speech.

70
00:05:03,214 --> 00:05:05,409
I love my life! I love my life!

71
00:05:06,217 --> 00:05:07,411
''Brian's Song''!

72
00:05:10,388 --> 00:05:11,838
The meeting went great?

73
00:05:11,838 --> 00:05:13,288
So great!

74
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:16,383
He showed me where the restaurant's gonna be.

75
00:05:17,194 --> 00:05:20,220
It's not too big or too small. It's just right.

76
00:05:20,331 --> 00:05:24,324
Was it formerly owned by a blond woman and some bears?

77
00:05:24,402 --> 00:05:28,202
I'm cooking for him Monday, kind of an audition.

78
00:05:28,306 --> 00:05:33,209
Phoebe, he wants you here. It's great. You can make yummy noises.

79
00:05:33,244 --> 00:05:34,791
What are you gonna make?

80
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,338
Yummy noises.

81
00:05:37,415 --> 00:05:39,883
And Monica, what are you gonna make?

82
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:42,351
I don't know. It's gotta be great.

83
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,445
I know what you can make! I know!

84
00:05:45,256 --> 00:05:49,249
You should make that thing with the stuff.

85
00:05:49,427 --> 00:05:53,363
You know that thing with the stuff?

86
00:05:54,432 --> 00:05:56,423
Okay, I don't know.

87
00:05:57,468 --> 00:06:01,165
Anyone know a good date place in the neighborhood?

88
00:06:01,205 --> 00:06:05,301
How about Tony's? If you finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.

89
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,477
Anyone know a good place if you're not dating a puma?

90
00:06:14,218 --> 00:06:15,799
Who are you going out with?

91
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:17,380
Is this the bug lady?

92
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:20,316
''I love you, Ross.''

93
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:26,226
Her name is Celia and she's insect curator at the museum.

94
00:06:27,431 --> 00:06:29,365
What are you gonna do?

95
00:06:29,365 --> 00:06:36,203
Go out to dinner then bring her back to my place and introduce her to my monkey.

97
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:41,235
And he's not speaking metaphorically.

98
00:06:43,214 --> 00:06:48,413
So back to your place? You thinking maybe....

99
00:06:50,221 --> 00:06:52,416
Well, I don't know....

100
00:06:53,224 --> 00:06:55,317
I'm hoping....

101
00:06:56,227 --> 00:06:58,320
That monkey is a chick magnet.

102
00:06:58,362 --> 00:07:04,267
She'll take one look at his cute, little face and it'll seal the deal.

103
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:09,195
Celia, don't worry. He's not gonna hurt you!

104
00:07:09,273 --> 00:07:11,264
Soothing tones.

105
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:14,188
Here, Marcel.

106
00:07:14,188 --> 00:07:16,167
I can't stand this.

107
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,248
He's got his claws on my--

108
00:07:18,248 --> 00:07:20,216
Yeah, all right.

109
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,192
Okay, try this salmon mousse.

110
00:07:31,395 --> 00:07:32,487
Good.

111
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,222
Is it better than the other salmon mousse?

112
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,268
It's creamier.

113
00:07:38,268 --> 00:07:40,236
Yeah? Well, is that better?

114
00:07:40,304 --> 00:07:44,297
I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish.

115
00:07:44,442 --> 00:07:47,309
I'm just happy I'm keeping it down.

116
00:07:53,217 --> 00:07:54,411
God, what happened to you?

117
00:07:55,219 --> 00:08:02,282
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests intelligence tests, personality tests, and what do I learn?

119
00:08:03,194 --> 00:08:09,155
''You're suited for data processing for a large multinational corporation.''

120
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,363
That's so great! You already know how to do that.

121
00:08:13,204 --> 00:08:15,172
Can you believe it?

122
00:08:15,206 --> 00:08:18,369
Don't I seem like I should be doing something cool?

123
00:08:18,476 --> 00:08:22,412
I just always pictured myself doing something....

124
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,272
Something!

125
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:27,316
Chandler, I know, I know.

126
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:32,280
Hey, you can see your nipples through this shirt.

127
00:08:35,326 --> 00:08:37,385
Maybe this will cheer you up.

128
00:08:38,395 --> 00:08:44,197
I had a grape about five hours ago, so I better split this with you.

129
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:47,395
It's supposed to be small. It's a pre-appetizer.

130
00:08:47,438 --> 00:08:50,464
The French call it an amuse-bouche.

131
00:08:53,344 --> 00:08:56,404
Well, it is amusing.

132
00:09:03,387 --> 00:09:06,379
Hi, Wendy. Yeah, 8:00.

133
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:10,292
What did we say, $10 an hour?

134
00:09:10,394 --> 00:09:14,262
Okay, great. All right, I'll see you then.

135
00:09:14,298 --> 00:09:16,346
$10 an hour for what?

136
00:09:16,346 --> 00:09:18,394
A waitress from work is helping me.

137
00:09:19,303 --> 00:09:21,168
Waitressing?

138
00:09:24,275 --> 00:09:28,302
Of course I thought of you. But....

139
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:29,374
But....

140
00:09:29,374 --> 00:09:30,369
But, but....

141
00:09:32,316 --> 00:09:37,219
But it's just this night has to go just perfect, you know?

142
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:41,314
Wendy's more of a professional waitress.

143
00:09:43,494 --> 00:09:49,433
And I'm maintaining my amateur status so I can waitress in the Olympics.

144
00:09:52,336 --> 00:09:57,330
I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76.

145
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,335
Took home a bronze.

146
00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:06,306
Amuse-bouche?

147
00:10:23,334 --> 00:10:25,325
Talk to me.

148
00:10:29,373 --> 00:10:32,433
A weird thing happened on the train this morning--

149
00:10:33,243 --> 00:10:35,438
Talk dirty.

150
00:10:39,249 --> 00:10:41,245
Here?

151
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:43,241
Come on. Come on.

152
00:10:43,354 --> 00:10:46,482
Say something hot.

153
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:51,352
What? What?

154
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:59,265
Vulva.

155
00:11:11,348 --> 00:11:13,316
Vulva?

156
00:11:14,418 --> 00:11:18,445
I panicked, all right? She took me by surprise.

157
00:11:19,256 --> 00:11:23,215
But it wasn't a total loss. We ended up cuddling.

158
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,423
You cuddled? How many times?

159
00:11:27,364 --> 00:11:29,423
Shut up. It was nice.

160
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:32,525
I don't think I'm a dirty-talking kind of guy.

161
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:37,468
Just say what you wanna do to her. Or what you want her to do to you.

162
00:11:38,242 --> 00:11:41,336
Or what other people might be doing to each other.

163
00:11:41,445 --> 00:11:44,471
I'll tell you what. Try something on me.

164
00:11:47,351 --> 00:11:49,251
Please be kidding.

165
00:11:51,388 --> 00:11:52,446
Why not?

166
00:11:53,257 --> 00:11:58,354
Just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.

167
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:06,394
I'm in my apartment....

168
00:12:07,304 --> 00:12:08,350
Yeah, what else?

169
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,396
You're not there.

170
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,438
We're not having this conversation.

171
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:15,436
All right, I'll start. Ready?

172
00:12:16,346 --> 00:12:25,220
Oh, Ross...you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.

174
00:12:29,426 --> 00:12:30,922
Now you say something.

175
00:12:30,922 --> 00:12:32,418
I really don't think so.

176
00:12:33,263 --> 00:12:37,427
You like this woman, right? You wanna see her again, right?

177
00:12:37,468 --> 00:12:42,269
If you can't talk dirty to me, how will you talk dirty to her?

178
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:44,534
Now tell me you wanna caress my butt!

179
00:12:48,445 --> 00:12:51,243
Okay, turn around.

180
00:12:51,448 --> 00:12:54,246
I don't want you staring at me.

181
00:12:54,351 --> 00:12:56,478
All right, I'm not looking. Go ahead.

182
00:12:57,287 --> 00:12:58,447
Okay.

183
00:13:01,391 --> 00:13:09,393
I want-- Okay, I want to feel your hot, soft skin with my lips.

185
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,432
There you go. Keep going, keep going.

186
00:13:19,243 --> 00:13:22,235
I want to take my tongue and--

187
00:13:31,321 --> 00:13:32,447
Say it.

188
00:13:35,425 --> 00:13:37,416
Say it!

189
00:13:38,262 --> 00:13:45,428
--run it all over your body...until you're trembling with--

191
00:14:04,388 --> 00:14:06,379
With?

192
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:10,276
Funny story.

193
00:14:10,276 --> 00:14:12,227
You're not gonna believe this.

194
00:14:12,296 --> 00:14:16,323
I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.

195
00:14:18,435 --> 00:14:19,965
The trembling thing was nice.

196
00:14:19,965 --> 00:14:21,495
Shut up!

197
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:25,231
That guy from your old job called again.

198
00:14:25,442 --> 00:14:27,421
Again?

199
00:14:27,421 --> 00:14:29,400
And again and again and again.

200
00:14:34,418 --> 00:14:36,352
And again.

201
00:14:37,254 --> 00:14:41,315
Hey, Mr. Costilick. How's life on the 1 5th floor?

202
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,358
Yeah, I miss you too.

203
00:14:43,427 --> 00:14:48,262
It's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home.

204
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:53,459
That's very generous. But this isn't about the money.

205
00:14:54,238 --> 00:14:58,368
I need more than a job. I need something I really care ab--

206
00:14:59,243 --> 00:15:01,473
That's on top of the year-end bonus?

207
00:15:02,212 --> 00:15:03,304
Your dream!

208
00:15:03,413 --> 00:15:07,213
Look, AI, I'm not playing hardball here, okay?

209
00:15:07,284 --> 00:15:11,277
This is not a negotiation. This is a rejection!

210
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:14,186
Stop saying numbers!

211
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:17,385
I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy!

212
00:15:18,195 --> 00:15:20,322
I'll see you Monday!

213
00:15:33,343 --> 00:15:38,508
Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle.

214
00:15:39,316 --> 00:15:41,307
This is a cube!

215
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:43,442
Look at this.

216
00:15:46,456 --> 00:15:49,448
You have a window!

217
00:15:50,227 --> 00:15:53,253
Yes, indeed-y. With a beautiful view of--

218
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:56,332
Look! That guy's peeing!

219
00:15:57,334 --> 00:16:00,303
That's enough of the view. Check this out.

220
00:16:01,204 --> 00:16:03,172
Okay, sit down here.

221
00:16:03,273 --> 00:16:05,366
This is great.

222
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:07,204
You ready?

223
00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:08,199
Yeah.

224
00:16:08,378 --> 00:16:10,403
Helen, could you come in here?

225
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,413
Thank you, Helen. That'll be all.

226
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:23,316
Last time I do that. I promise.

227
00:16:27,397 --> 00:16:29,865
She doesn't seem very warm.

228
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:32,333
I know. She has no personality.

229
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,307
Wendy, don't do this to me.

230
00:16:39,409 --> 00:16:44,210
We had a deal. Yeah, you promised.

231
00:16:50,454 --> 00:16:52,905
Who was that?

232
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:55,356
Wendy bailed.

233
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:58,360
I have no waitress.

234
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:03,356
That's too bad. Bye-bye.

235
00:17:04,267 --> 00:17:07,259
Ten dollars an hour! Twelve dollars an hour!

236
00:17:07,404 --> 00:17:12,239
I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.

237
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:15,369
When you ran out on your wedding, I was there.

238
00:17:15,412 --> 00:17:19,405
I put a roof over your head! If that means nothing....

239
00:17:20,317 --> 00:17:22,478
Twenty dollars an hour.

240
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:25,218
Done.

241
00:17:31,395 --> 00:17:35,388
Hello. Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?

242
00:17:38,435 --> 00:17:39,430
Hi, Steve.

243
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,425
Hello, Monica.

244
00:17:41,204 --> 00:17:43,263
Hello, greeter girl.

245
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,936
This is Rachel.

246
00:17:44,936 --> 00:17:46,432
Yeah, okay.

247
00:17:48,311 --> 00:17:50,336
Everything smells so delicious.

248
00:17:50,414 --> 00:17:55,215
I can't remember ever smelling such a delicious combination of--

249
00:17:55,252 --> 00:17:56,344
Okay, smells.

250
00:17:58,221 --> 00:18:00,234
It's a lovely apartment.

251
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:02,247
Thank you. Would you like a tour?

252
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:05,385
I was just being polite, but all right.

253
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:09,815
What's up?

254
00:18:09,815 --> 00:18:14,166
In the cab on the way over Steve blazed up a doobie.

256
00:18:15,272 --> 00:18:16,364
What?

257
00:18:17,174 --> 00:18:21,270
Smoked a joint, you know? Lit a bone. Weed, hemp, ganja--

258
00:18:22,412 --> 00:18:24,380
I'm with you, Cheech.

259
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,850
Do you think he's gonna be cool?

260
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,284
Is it dry in here?

261
00:18:34,191 --> 00:18:36,182
Let me get you some wine.

262
00:18:36,293 --> 00:18:39,387
I think we're ready for our first course too.

263
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:56,312
These are rock shrimp ravioli in a cilantro ponzu sauce with just a touch of minced...ginger.

266
00:18:56,346 --> 00:19:00,180
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy!

267
00:19:03,153 --> 00:19:05,149
These are fantastic!

268
00:19:05,149 --> 00:19:07,145
Gosh! I'm so glad you liked them.

269
00:19:07,257 --> 00:19:10,351
Like them? I could eat 100 of them!

270
00:19:13,163 --> 00:19:18,359
That's all there is of these but in a few minutes, we'll serve some tartlets.

272
00:19:19,202 --> 00:19:20,396
''Tartlets''?

273
00:19:21,171 --> 00:19:22,365
''Tartlets.''

274
00:19:23,306 --> 00:19:25,274
''Tartlets.''

275
00:19:27,177 --> 00:19:29,168
Word has lost all meaning.

276
00:19:35,318 --> 00:19:38,287
Excuse me. Can I help you with anything?

277
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:42,223
You know, I don't know what I'm looking for.

278
00:19:57,307 --> 00:19:59,332
Cool! Taco shells!

279
00:20:01,411 --> 00:20:05,211
They're like a little corn envelope, you know?

280
00:20:05,315 --> 00:20:07,783
You don't wanna spoil your appetite.

281
00:20:07,783 --> 00:20:10,251
Hey, Sugar-O's!

282
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,414
You know, if you just wait another 6 1 /2 minutes--

283
00:20:14,224 --> 00:20:17,421
Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!

284
00:20:21,431 --> 00:20:23,399
No, we don't.

285
00:20:23,399 --> 00:20:25,367
Oh, okay.

286
00:20:26,336 --> 00:20:28,236
Sorry.

287
00:20:32,242 --> 00:20:34,437
Why don't you just have a seat here?

288
00:20:40,283 --> 00:20:41,915
Give me the gummy bears.

289
00:20:41,915 --> 00:20:43,547
No.

290
00:20:45,555 --> 00:20:46,903
Give them to me.

291
00:20:46,903 --> 00:20:48,251
We'll share.

292
00:20:48,358 --> 00:20:49,905
No. Give me the bears.

293
00:20:49,905 --> 00:20:51,452
You can't have any.

294
00:20:52,262 --> 00:20:54,253
It's not worth it!

295
00:20:54,364 --> 00:20:57,299
Bears overboard! They're drowning!

296
00:20:58,468 --> 00:21:02,302
Don't just stand there. Call 9-1
-1 .

297
00:21:02,405 --> 00:21:06,239
Hey, fellas, grab onto a Sugar-O! Save yourselves!

298
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:11,303
Help! Help, I'm drowning!

299
00:21:11,448 --> 00:21:13,382
That's it! Dinner is over!

300
00:21:13,382 --> 00:21:15,316
What! Why?

301
00:21:15,418 --> 00:21:20,321
Why? What if I came into your office and I started...?

302
00:21:20,423 --> 00:21:22,357
I can't think of an example.

303
00:21:22,425 --> 00:21:30,231
I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this and you can't wait 4 1 /2 minutes for a tartlet?

305
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:41,376
So I told him, ''I'm sorry. That's how I feel.''

306
00:21:41,444 --> 00:21:45,380
And he told me I harsh-ed his buzz.

307
00:21:46,349 --> 00:21:50,342
Then I said, ''Don't eat that. It's a kitchen magnet.''

308
00:21:51,454 --> 00:21:56,391
And he didn't listen, so we left him in the emergency room.

309
00:21:56,493 --> 00:21:58,859
Mon, I'm sorry.

310
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,225
What a tool.

311
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:03,811
You did the right thing.

312
00:22:03,811 --> 00:22:06,291
You don't wanna work for that guy.

313
00:22:06,403 --> 00:22:09,304
I just thought that this was it.

314
00:22:09,406 --> 00:22:12,404
Don't worry. You're an amazing chef.

315
00:22:12,404 --> 00:22:15,402
Those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.

316
00:22:16,346 --> 00:22:19,315
Am I gonna get paid for the full three hours?

317
00:22:19,349 --> 00:22:23,217
Just a question. We'll talk about it later.

318
00:22:27,324 --> 00:22:29,315
So, how did it go with Celia?

319
00:22:31,227 --> 00:22:33,223
I was unbelievable.

320
00:22:33,223 --> 00:22:35,219
All right, Ross!

321
00:22:35,332 --> 00:22:37,527
I was the James Michener of dirty talk.

322
00:22:38,268 --> 00:22:40,463
It was the most elaborate filth ever heard.

323
00:22:41,271 --> 00:22:46,334
I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif.

324
00:22:46,443 --> 00:22:49,344
At one point, there were villagers.

325
00:22:51,281 --> 00:22:52,339
And--?

326
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:59,480
By the time we finished all the dirty talk it was late and we were exhausted--

328
00:23:00,223 --> 00:23:01,320
You cuddled.

329
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,417
Yeah, which was nice.

330
00:23:03,293 --> 00:23:06,421
Do you guys want to try to catch a late movie?

331
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,828
Shouldn't we wait for Chandler?

332
00:23:08,828 --> 00:23:10,426
Where the hell is he?

333
00:23:11,301 --> 00:23:17,238
I know what time it is but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!

335
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,408
Let me tell you something.

336
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:25,238
You will care about it because I care about it. Got it? Good!

337
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,424
How's this?

338
00:23:42,232 --> 00:23:44,325
Sorry. How about over here?

339
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:46,335
That means it's working.

340
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:47,364
Does this hurt?

341
00:23:47,364 --> 00:23:48,359
No.

342
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:51,230
How about this?

343
00:23:51,374 --> 00:23:53,467
There you go!
