1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:04,369
This is pretty much what's happened so far.

2
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:07,438
Ross was in love with Rachel forever.

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:13,240
When he tried to tell her, things got in the way. Like cats, Italian guys.

4
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,339
Finally, Chandler said, ''Forget about her. ''

5
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:21,284
When Ross was in China, Chandler let it slip that Ross loved Rachel.

6
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,288
She said, ''Oh, my God!''

7
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:26,291
So she went to the airport to meet him.

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,261
She didn't know Ross was with another woman.

9
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,491
That's everything you need to know.

10
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,360
Enough about us. How've you been?

11
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,342
Flight number 257 from Beijing now arriving.

12
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,447
Oh, my God.

13
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,451
Oh, my God.

14
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:35,556
Excuse me.

15
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,457
Move, move, move! Emergency, please!

16
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,357
Excuse me.

17
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:50,467
There you are.

18
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:56,277
So, so....

19
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,283
How was China? You!

20
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,454
It was great. What happened?

21
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:03,836
You're bleeding.

22
00:02:03,836 --> 00:02:04,416
I am?

23
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,425
Oh, look at that! Yes, I am.

24
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,326
Enough of me, Mr. Back-from-the-Orient.

25
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:13,331
Come on, I wanna hear everything! Everything!

26
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,334
Well, where do I start?

27
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:20,372
This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel.

28
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:29,340
These are.... These are aren't for you.

30
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,343
These are for you.

31
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,386
Welcome to our country.

32
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:40,483
Thank you. I'm from New York!

33
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:47,262
No problem. We'll use them to stop the bleeding.

34
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,418
Baggage claim?

35
00:02:50,418 --> 00:02:51,567
Okay.

36
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,344
She went to the airport. She's going for it with Ross.

37
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:05,316
Oh, my God! This is huge!

38
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,210
This is bigger than huge. This is....

39
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,313
All right, what's bigger than huge?

40
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:12,891
This?

41
00:03:12,891 --> 00:03:13,357
Yes.

42
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,421
You got new haircuts.

43
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:19,454
Yes, we did. Thanks to Vidal Buffay.

44
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,431
Because, ''If you don't look good, we don't look good.''

45
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,461
I love that voice.

46
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:32,240
Here. And the winner is Ava Gardner.

47
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,369
You guys.

48
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:39,274
Airport. Airport. Ross. Not alone.

49
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,478
Julie. Arm around her.

50
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,358
Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!

51
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,293
I think she's trying to say something.

52
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,353
Quick, get the verbs.

53
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,459
You! You!

54
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,293
You said he liked me! You!

55
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,496
You slowpokes!

56
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,401
That's all right. We got the bags.

57
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,759
Hi. Hello.

58
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,209
Hi, honey.

59
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,212
This is my sister, Monica.

60
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,315
This is Chandler. Phoebe, hi.

61
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,367
Joey, what up?

62
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:13,317
Hello.

63
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,211
Everyone, this is Julie.

64
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,449
Julie.

65
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,331
I'm not here. We haven't met.

66
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:29,367
I make a better impression without 20 hours of plane on me.

67
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:30,851
And bus.

68
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:32,233
Oh, my God!

69
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:33,333
The screaming guy--

70
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,328
The spitting.

71
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,237
You gotta hear this.

72
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,435
We're on this 200-year-old bus.

73
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:40,269
At least 200.

74
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,349
And the chicken poops in her lap.

75
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,357
I'm so sorry.

76
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,382
I just gave away the ending.

77
00:04:53,493 --> 00:05:00,228
I just heard this story in the cab and it is all I can think about.

79
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,427
This is amazing.

80
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,785
How did this happen?

81
00:05:06,785 --> 00:05:08,332
We were in grad school together.

82
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,502
Haven't seen each other since. I land in China.

83
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,213
Guess who's in charge?

84
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,248
Julie!

85
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,308
Isn't that great?

86
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:23,348
Isn't it just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

87
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,416
It's an expression.

88
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,453
We just wanted to say a quick hi.

89
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,327
Then we'll see the baby.

90
00:05:32,327 --> 00:05:33,424
Then get sleep.

91
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,530
It's 6:00 tomorrow, our time.

92
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,363
Don't tell us what will happen. I like surprises.

93
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,436
Bye!

94
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,518
Can I get some coffee?

95
00:05:57,518 --> 00:05:58,547
Sure.

96
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,374
You talk to him yet?

97
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:01,289
No.

98
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,418
Then, no.

99
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,400
What happened to you in China?

100
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:21,213
When last we left, you were in love with....

101
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,210
I know I was.

102
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:31,221
But there was this voice that kept saying ''It'll never happen. Move on.'' You know whose voice it was?

104
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,348
God?

105
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,224
It was you, pal.

106
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,229
Maybe it was God doing me.

107
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:43,531
Aside from being almighty, he's a wiz at doing voices.

108
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:48,239
You were right. She looks at me as a friend. That's all.

109
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,235
Then I met Julie, and we're having a great time.

110
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:57,476
I never would've gone for it with her, if not for you.

111
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,311
Well, you owe me one, big guy.

112
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,210
Your lemonade.

113
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,313
Didn't order it.

114
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:09,284
Then go take that back. They'll charge you.

115
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:12,193
Go, go, go. Come on, come on.

116
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,291
So, what'd you find out?

117
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:18,294
He said....

118
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,235
He said....

119
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:27,302
He said they're having a great time. I'm sorry.

120
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:37,412
The silver lining, if you wanna see it is that he made this decision by himself without any outside help whatsoever.

123
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,517
How is that a silver lining?

124
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,421
You have to really wanna see it.

125
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:53,270
Ironically, these guys were picked last in gym.

126
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:54,464
Hey, Pheebs.

127
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,758
You know what I'm thinking?

128
00:07:56,758 --> 00:07:58,242
Oh, okay.

129
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:09,413
How it's been so long since you've had sex you're wondering if they've changed it?

132
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,383
Not even close.

133
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:17,192
No. Although now that's what I'm thinking.

134
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,296
What were you thinking?

135
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,392
You gave the guys great haircuts. I thought you could do mine.

136
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,338
Oh. No.

137
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:29,196
Why not?

138
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,208
Because I'm just....

139
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,404
I'm incredibly anal, an unbelievable control freak.

140
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,381
No, you're not.

141
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:38,315
I know I'm not, but you are.

142
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,345
I was trying to spare your feelings.

143
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,419
Hold on. Ross, Julie for you.

144
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:57,334
Excuse me. Who gave her our phone number?

145
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:01,270
Okay, well.... Who had the motive?

146
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,400
Was it the actor?

147
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,372
The chef? The masseuse?

148
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,172
Or was it the guy who's dating her?

149
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,319
Guy who's dating her.

150
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,385
Hey. Anybody know a good tailor?

151
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,223
Need clothes altered?

152
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:26,288
No, I'm looking for a man to draw on me with chalk.

153
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,425
See Frankie. My family's been going to him forever.

154
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:34,298
He did my first suit when I was 1 5. No, wait, 1 6.

155
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:38,241
No, excuse me, 1 5.

156
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,404
All right, when was 1 990?

157
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,445
Stop the Q-Tip when there's resistance.

158
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,328
Okay. Okay. Sweetheart, I'll see you later.

159
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,422
Okay, bye.

160
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,327
That is so sweet.

161
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,231
Okay. No, you hang up.

162
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,367
No, you--

163
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,246
One, two, three.

164
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,440
You didn't either.

165
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,480
She didn't hang up.

166
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,384
No, you hang up.

167
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,258
You. You.

168
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:43,264
Sorry, I thought you were talking to me.

169
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,466
Rachel.

170
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,313
I'll just call her back.

171
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,507
I'm sorry. We got disconnected.

172
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,478
No, you hang up.

173
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,321
How did this happen to me?

174
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,324
A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.

175
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,223
Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.

176
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:10,358
Now all of a sudden, he's Ross this really great guy that I can't have.

178
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:13,336
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.

179
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,236
I know you did.

180
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,467
Hey, you wanna hit Chandler again?

181
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:22,278
I'm just gonna deal with it.

182
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,444
I gotta get out of here.

183
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:34,452
I don't care what you say. Something's bothering her.

184
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,493
You know, I think I was 1 6.

185
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:47,472
You know, I think I don't care.

186
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,474
Please, just a little bit off the back?

187
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,306
I'm still on ''no.''

188
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:55,402
Morning.

189
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,473
Could you close your eyes?

190
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:02,213
No, no, no. I'm not falling for that again.

191
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,837
What's going on?

192
00:12:05,837 --> 00:12:07,418
I did a stupid thing last night.

193
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,428
What stupid thing?

194
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:21,262
Paolo, now you've seen everybody and they've all seen you.

195
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:25,469
How did this happen?

196
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,337
I kind of ran into him last night.

197
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,876
Where?

198
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:31,372
His apartment. Is this juice?

199
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:35,549
Whoa, the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?

200
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:39,451
Oh, God, I know. I'm pathetic, I'm a loser.

201
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,453
You're not pathetic. You're just sad.

202
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,293
Upset people do stupid things.

203
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:49,494
If I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't--

204
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:56,273
But this is about your horrible mistake.

205
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,345
Sorry we're late. We were....

206
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,405
Well, there was touching.

207
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:11,389
Hey, Ross.

208
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:12,356
Hey, Paolo.

209
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,351
What, uh...?

210
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,219
What are you doing here?

211
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,230
I do Raquel.

212
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,272
So he's back?

213
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:31,241
Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?

214
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:32,435
No, not a problem.

215
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,236
Good. Glad it's not a problem.

216
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,449
You're gonna have to not touch my ass.

217
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:48,360
Well, despite the yummy bagels and palpable tension my pants need to be altered.

219
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:52,353
When you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.

220
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,389
He'll know what it means.

221
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:59,368
You sure he'll crack that code?

222
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:04,436
It's funny. The last time Paolo was here, my hair was so much cuter.

223
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,336
All right.

224
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:14,209
You have to promise that you will not be control-y and bossy and all Monica about it.

226
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,838
I promise.

227
00:14:16,838 --> 00:14:18,322
All right, let's see.

228
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:22,418
Now, some of you are gonna get cut and some of you aren't.

229
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:27,355
But I promise none of you will feel a thing.

230
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,445
That's it. I quit.

231
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:43,345
What? I didn't say anything.

232
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:47,250
This isn't the face of a person who trusts a person.

233
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:53,381
This is the face of a person who doesn't trust a person.

235
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,290
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

236
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:59,296
It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.

237
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,425
Would you relax? I know what I am doing.

238
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,397
This is how he wears it.

239
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,822
How who wears it?

240
00:15:08,822 --> 00:15:10,238
Demi Moore.

241
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,311
Demi Moore is not a ''he.''

242
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:16,246
Well, he was a ''he'' in Arthur and in 10.

243
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,443
That's Dudley Moore.

244
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,447
I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.

245
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,412
Oh, my God.

246
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,414
Oh, God.

247
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,321
Oh, my God! I'm sorry!

248
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,228
Which is Demi Moore?

249
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:38,235
She's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost.

250
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,463
She's got gorgeous hair.

251
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,228
I know.

252
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,275
I wanted to look like her.

253
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,426
You know, my mom's dead.

254
00:15:48,426 --> 00:15:50,474
Oh, my God.

255
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:01,482
Well, this is what my butt must look like to a fly.

256
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,809
How long do you want the cuffs?

257
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:08,289
At least as long as I have the pants.

258
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,203
I just got that.

259
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:20,207
Now we'll do your inseam.

260
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,841
How is she?

261
00:16:34,841 --> 00:16:37,224
It's too soon to tell.

262
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,458
She's resting, which is a good sign.

263
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:43,223
How's the hair?

264
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:46,429
I'm not gonna lie to you. It doesn't look good.

265
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,311
There's nothing you can do?

266
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:56,246
At this point, it's a waiting game.

267
00:16:56,382 --> 00:17:00,375
I put a clip on one side, which seems to stop the curling.

268
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,378
Can we see her?

269
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:06,289
Your hair looks too good. It would upset her.

270
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,259
Ross, why don't you come on in?

271
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:16,850
Well, how you doing?

272
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,266
I'm okay.

273
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,417
That bad, huh?

274
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:20,497
What?

275
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,437
I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable.

276
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,405
It's one of my gifts.

277
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:38,356
Joey, when I saw him get off that plane with her I really thought I hit rock bottom.

279
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:46,260
But today, it's like there's rock bottom 50 feet of crap then me.

282
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,264
Tell Ross how you feel.

283
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,360
How can I just tell him? What about Julie?

284
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,430
What about her? It's only been two weeks.

285
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,233
Ross has been in love with you for 10 years.

286
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,275
I don't know. I don't know.

287
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,179
I've been with my share of women.

288
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,378
I've been with a lot of people's share of women.

289
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:16,386
But the point is I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you.

291
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,193
Really?

292
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,304
Yo, paesan.

293
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,210
Can I talk to you for a sec?

294
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:39,409
Your tailor is a very bad man.

296
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,321
What are you talking about?

297
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,356
Hey, what's going on?

298
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:57,527
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.

300
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,352
What?

301
00:18:59,352 --> 00:19:00,267
No way.

302
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,789
I've been going to him for years.

303
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:05,206
He said he was doing my inseam.

304
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:09,179
Then he ran his hand up my leg and there was definite--

305
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,270
What?

306
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,376
Cupping.

307
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,287
That's how they do pants.

308
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,316
First, they go up one side, they move it over.

309
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:27,421
Then, up the other side, move it back. Then they do the rear.

310
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,395
Isn't that how a tailor measures pants?

311
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:36,231
Yes, yes, it is. In prison.

312
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,215
What's the matter with you?

313
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,305
What?

314
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,444
That's not?

315
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:57,353
Oh, my God.

316
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,428
I'll put on a pot of coffee.

317
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:13,277
Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.

318
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,372
Come on. It's not that bad. You never know.

319
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,350
Bell-bottoms came back.

320
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,479
I like it.

321
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,448
I do. I think it's a 10.

322
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,350
Thank you.

323
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,293
My hair is amused.

324
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,457
Come on, things could be worse.

325
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:38,458
You could ''get caught between the moon and New York City.''

326
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:43,407
''It's crazy, but it's true.''

327
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,503
Thank you.

328
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,372
Well, I gotta go. Bye.

329
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,898
Bye, Rach.

330
00:20:50,898 --> 00:20:52,382
Wait, are you leaving?

331
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,317
That's what I meant by ''bye.''

332
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,355
Can I talk to you for a sec?

333
00:20:57,355 --> 00:20:59,323
Okay.

334
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:04,318
When the doctor does that hernia test....

335
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,424
That's okay.

336
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:13,333
If your mechanic does it....

337
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,273
What's going on?

338
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:26,478
Well, okay, first of all Paolo and I are not back together.

340
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,243
That was a stupid thing I did.

341
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:34,448
If I could go back in time and do it again well, I wouldn't.

343
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,259
Second of all....

344
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:40,487
What?

345
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:53,844
Is this one of those things where you break up with a guy I tell you what I think, you get back together with him and I look like a complete idiot?

348
00:21:53,844 --> 00:21:55,311
No.

349
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,507
Well, then, I think the guy's scum.

350
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,413
I hate him. I actually-- I physically hate him.

351
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,315
I always have.

352
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:10,317
And you are way too good to be with a guy like that.

353
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,321
Really?

354
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:24,231
You deserve someone who appreciates you and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing and adorable and sexy you are.

357
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:30,475
You know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking ''Oh, my God. I'm with Rachel.''

359
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,451
You know? Someone who makes you feel good.

360
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,278
Like the way I do with Julie.

361
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,359
Was there a ''second of all''?

362
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:54,370
No, I think that was the whole ''all.''

363
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,469
I gotta go. Okay. Okay.

364
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:01,926
Okay.

365
00:23:01,926 --> 00:23:02,506
Okay.

366
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,314
No, I swear to God, Dad. That's not how they measure pants.

367
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:23,265
I was thinking shorter, like Andie MacDowell's haircut.

368
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,398
Yeah, I could do that.

369
00:23:24,398 --> 00:23:25,461
Really?

370
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:26,902
You wanna do it now?

371
00:23:26,902 --> 00:23:27,533
Great!

372
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:31,434
See you.

373
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:35,378
I just wanna make really sure this time.

374
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:40,350
Andie MacDowell is the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?

375
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:42,275
No.

376
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,254
That's Roddy McDowall.

377
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,260
Andie MacDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.

378
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,829
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

379
00:23:54,829 --> 00:23:56,393
You're welcome.
