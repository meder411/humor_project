1
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,467
I'll get candles and my mom's tablecloth.

2
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:15,270
And since it's Rachel's birthday, I thought I'd poach a salmon.

3
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,372
What?

4
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:20,442
Question: Why do we always have parties where you poach things?

5
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,387
Wanna be on the food committee?

6
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:25,447
Question two: Why do we have committees?

7
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:30,251
Why can't we just get pizzas and beers and have fun?

8
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:34,356
Fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside.

9
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:37,370
And I'm not sure we are.

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,268
You don't want it to be special.

11
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,500
You can throw any kind of party you want.

12
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,402
Joey, they're not real!

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,374
I start miles beneath these things. They're fake.

14
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,284
See? Honk, honk!

15
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,583
Wow, it's like porno for clowns!

16
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,305
Neither of Rachel's sisters can come.

17
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:51,502
I have to invite Dylan and Emma and Shannon Cooper.

18
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:53,996
No Shannon Cooper.

19
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:55,480
Why not her?

20
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,477
Because she.... She steals stuff.

21
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:06,418
Or maybe she doesn't and Joey slept with her and never called her back.

22
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,455
Joey, that is horrible.

23
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:14,360
Hey, I liked her, all right? Maybe too much. I don't know.

24
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,231
I guess I just got scared.

25
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,239
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

26
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,267
I didn't think anyone would buy that. Okay!

27
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,876
Hi, honey. How'd it go?

28
00:02:26,876 --> 00:02:28,474
It was the graduation from hell.

29
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:32,480
My cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.

30
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,446
It's supposed to be a joyous occasion.

31
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,480
Nobody thought my sister would graduate.

32
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:43,456
It's a testament to what a girl from Long Island will do for a Celica.

33
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,410
What happened?

34
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,456
My parents happened.

35
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:53,363
All they had to do was sit and smile and not talk about the divorce. But no!

37
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,375
They fought during the commencement address.

38
00:02:56,476 --> 00:03:01,345
Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them.

39
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,246
You know the good news?

40
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,343
I get to serve coffee for eight hours.

41
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,315
So we don't invite her parents.

42
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,790
How about just her mom?

43
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,223
Why her mom?

44
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,420
Because I already invited her.

45
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,463
Did you ask Stacy Roth?

46
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,358
Can't invite her.

47
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:26,237
She also steals.

48
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,437
So does her roommate.

49
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,481
Here are the candles. Where's the cake?

50
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:46,351
We're not having birthday cake. We're having birthday flan.

51
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,284
Excuse me?

52
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,328
It's a Mexican custard dessert.

53
00:03:50,328 --> 00:03:52,262
That's nice.

54
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:55,461
Happy birthday, Rachel. Here's some goo!

55
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,307
Dr. Greene!

56
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:07,209
Oh, my God! It's Rachel's dad.

57
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,313
What are you doing here?

58
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,316
A father can't see the daughter on her birthday?

59
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,320
No, no, the father can.

60
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:18,313
But since I'm the roommate, I can tell you she's not here.

61
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,450
And I'll pass along the message. So bye-bye.

62
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,355
You're having a party.

63
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,227
No, no, not a party.

64
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:30,234
Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows.

65
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,902
This is Phoebe, Chandler and Joey.

66
00:04:31,902 --> 00:04:33,534
I won't remember that.

67
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,365
So what's the deal?

68
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:40,378
Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff?

69
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:44,348
This isn't your first surprise party, is it, sir?

70
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,244
Hi, Monica.

71
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,449
The Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.

72
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:58,396
So basically, just a Chinese guy.

73
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:04,293
Dr. Greene, come with me. We'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.

74
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:10,198
All right. That sounds like a two-person job.

75
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,438
Well, my goodness! What was that?

76
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:18,411
I thought you were Rachel. We weren't ready for you yet.

77
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,469
You thought I was Rachel?

78
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:22,420
Because you look so young.

79
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:27,221
And because you're both, you know, white women.

80
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:33,324
Oh, I missed you kids. Should I put my coat in the bedroom?

81
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,350
No, I'll take that for you.

82
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,233
Well, thank you.

83
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,363
Such a gentleman. Thank you.

84
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:48,346
It all looks so nice. So festive. All the balloons.

85
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,544
Oh, the funniest thing happened to me on the way here.

86
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,365
I was driving--

87
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:54,445
That's great!

88
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:02,187
I can't wait to hear it, but I have to go to the bathroom.

89
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,290
Hey, come with me.

90
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,285
What?

91
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:10,291
Like we're gal pals. Like at a restaurant. It'll be fun! Come on.

92
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,772
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

93
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:18,336
Think. Think.

94
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,312
What would Jack and Chrissy do?

95
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:26,248
Okay, now that your coat is safely in the bed--

96
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,445
We can come back to the living room.

97
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:33,318
Joey and Chandler, it's time you take Dr. Greene over to your place.

98
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,361
Yes, absolutely.

99
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,420
Why, again?

100
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:43,258
Because that's where the party is, you goon!

101
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,332
This is the staging area.

102
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:47,328
Right, it's the staging area.

103
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,467
This is clearly in the wrong apartment.

104
00:06:55,448 --> 00:07:00,215
All right, you guys are off to party number one.

105
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,217
And you....

106
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,290
You are off to party number two.

107
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:09,283
Let's keep it moving, let's keep it moving.

108
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:14,496
Could you at least send some women to my party?

109
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:18,336
Okay, that's Ross. All right.

110
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,235
Okay, they're coming.

111
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,406
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.

112
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,250
Thanks for being born.

113
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:37,312
Thank you for my beautiful earrings. They're perfect. I love you.

114
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:41,325
Now, you can exchange them if you want, okay?

115
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,329
Now I love you even more.

116
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,429
Surprise!

117
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,338
Oh, my gosh! Wow! Monica!

118
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,466
Oh, my God. Mom! This is so great!

119
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,303
Happy birthday, sweetie.

120
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,281
You! I had no idea!

121
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:05,281
Really?

122
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:06,179
No, I knew.

123
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,219
All right.

124
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,380
There's food and drinks on the table.

125
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,385
Go across the hall. Now, Joey and Chandler's.

126
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:14,807
Why?

127
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:15,421
Just go.

128
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:18,385
Weird.

129
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,296
Surprise!

130
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,395
Happy birthday, sweet pea.

131
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,433
Daddy!

132
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:38,240
Both of them are here? Both of them are here?

133
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,330
Well, we could count again?

134
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,343
I can't believe this.

135
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:46,414
This is ridiculous. This is your birthday, your party.

136
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:50,252
Put them together. If they can't deal with it, who cares?

137
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,825
I do.

138
00:08:51,825 --> 00:08:53,321
That's who.

139
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,425
Will you be okay?

140
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:59,432
I don't really have a choice. I can look at the bright side.

141
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,401
I get two birthday parties and two cakes.

142
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,305
Well, actually, just one birthday flan.

143
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:10,170
What?

144
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,185
It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.

145
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:17,178
Talk to Monica. She's on the food committee.

146
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:29,200
A girl walked up to me and said, ''I want you, Dennis'' and stuck her tongue down my throat.

148
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,226
I love this party!

149
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,350
Volleyball question.

150
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,396
Volleyball.

151
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,197
We set up a court in your room.

152
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,405
You didn't like that gray lamp, did you?

153
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:44,246
A woman stuck her tongue down my throat. I'm not even listening.

154
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,285
Dennis!

155
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,253
Okay, that's me.

156
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:52,357
Can you keep Dad occupied? I'm gonna talk to Mom for a while.

157
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,326
Do you have any ideas for any openers?

158
00:09:55,461 --> 00:10:02,333
Stay clear of ''I'm the guy doing your daughter'' and you should be okay.

160
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,427
Take a piece of paper.

161
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:10,272
Here you go. And write down your most embarrassing memory.

162
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:17,374
When you're not using the markers, put the caps back on them because they will dry out.

164
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,241
Hi, Dr. Greene.

165
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:27,384
So how's everything in the vascular surgery game?

167
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:32,362
It's not a game, Ross. A woman died on my table today.

168
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,262
I'm sorry.

169
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,395
That's the good thing about my job.

170
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,498
All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.

171
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:50,406
I don't mean to be a pain about this but I've seen some of you just place them on.

173
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:56,411
You want to push the caps until you hear them click.

175
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,325
Gunther! Where you going?

176
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,260
I was sort of thinking about maybe--

177
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,355
No! No, you can't go! No, this is fun.

178
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:10,368
We're just getting started. Here's your marker.

179
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,362
If you want to go, just go.

180
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:18,239
No, she'll yell at me again.

181
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,458
All right, I can get you out.

182
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,437
What?

183
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,284
In a minute, I'll create a diversion.

184
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:32,381
When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back.

185
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,755
I think I need a drink.

186
00:11:34,755 --> 00:11:36,251
I'll get it for you.

187
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,329
What do you want?

188
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:38,296
Scotch.

189
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:42,493
I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.

190
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,816
Neat!

191
00:11:44,816 --> 00:11:46,363
Cool.

192
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:49,407
Neat, as in no rocks.

193
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,310
I know.

194
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:59,317
Hello, Ross! Where have you been?

195
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:03,219
I have been in the bathroom.

196
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:07,224
Stay clear of the salmon mousse.

197
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,253
Scotch neat.

198
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:16,267
That's Rachel's father's drink.

199
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,361
Mine too. Isn't that neat?

200
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,463
Scotch neat.

201
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,473
Would you excuse me?

202
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:35,250
Where are you sneaking off to, mister?

203
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,004
I'm getting my cigarettes.

204
00:12:37,004 --> 00:12:38,454
No.

205
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,925
What do you mean no?

206
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:43,359
See, because that's the staging area.

207
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:47,559
You go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party.

208
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:53,496
Take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you, sir.

210
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,321
Get my glasses too.

211
00:12:56,321 --> 00:12:58,369
All righty-roo.

212
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:04,214
What a great moment to say that for the first time.

213
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:11,349
Okay, the first person's most embarrassing memory is:

214
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,324
''Monica, your party sucks.''

215
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,421
Very funny.

216
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:20,255
Oh, no! Did someone forget to use a coaster?

217
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,266
What?

218
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,465
I don't see anything.

219
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,371
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.

220
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,474
Ross, whose glasses are those?

221
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,243
Mine.

222
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,388
You wear bifocals?

223
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:55,460
I have a condition apparently that I require...two different sets of focals.

225
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,496
Do you know my husband has glasses just like that?

226
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,434
Well, those are very popular frames.

227
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,302
Neil Sedaka wears them.

228
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,341
I hear you can get people out of here.

229
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,514
You didn't tell me your boyfriend smokes.

230
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,226
Yeah, like a chimney.

231
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,318
Big smoker.

232
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,458
Big, big smoker.

233
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:31,431
I'm gonna go out into the hallway and fire up this bad boy.

234
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:46,383
Are you wearing my glasses?

235
00:14:46,383 --> 00:14:49,284
Yes.

236
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:55,258
I was just warming up the earpieces for you.

237
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,352
Thank you.

238
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,489
Is that one of my cigarettes?

239
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:12,243
Yes, it is. I was just moistening the tip.

240
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:16,338
She's taking the trash out, so I can get you out.

241
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,316
But it has to be now. She'll be back soon.

242
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,340
And my friend?

243
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:24,253
Only you three. Any more and she'll get suspicious.

244
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,335
Let me just get my coat.

245
00:15:26,335 --> 00:15:28,314
There isn't time!

246
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:34,230
Just leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.

247
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,325
Is it true they have beer?

248
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:40,271
Everything you've heard is true.

249
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,237
Could you guys please keep it down?

250
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,335
We're trying to start a Boggle tournament.

251
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:52,274
If people find out they're playing spelling games there'll be nobody left here.

253
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:59,252
You! And you.

254
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:04,285
You're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther!

255
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,425
What are you doing here?

256
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,331
Welcome to the f--

257
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:22,304
I'm sorry. But these people needed me.

258
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:28,218
They work hard all week. It's Saturday. They deserve to have fun. Go!

259
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,223
You know, my party is fun. It's a quieter, less obvious sort of fun.

260
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:36,421
But if people would just give it a chance, it's--

261
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,849
You want me to see a therapist?

262
00:16:42,849 --> 00:16:45,266
Sweetheart, you have a problem.

263
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:49,239
You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.

264
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,339
Okay, Mom, I'll make an appointment.

265
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:55,438
But right now, I gotta go. I gotta go do a thing.

266
00:16:55,547 --> 00:17:01,179
Did you know your mother spent $1 200 on bonsai trees?

267
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,381
I felt like Gulliver around that place.

268
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:10,219
Daddy, I want to hear more about this, but I just have to do some stuff.

269
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:16,197
You work and work and work at a marriage but all he cares about is his boat.

271
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,203
You work and work and work on a boat.

272
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:22,240
He always ridiculed my pottery classes.

273
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,309
And you sand it and varnish it.

274
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,244
But when all's said and done, he drinks out of the mugs.

275
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:31,339
A night of her yoga and Bridges of Madison County....

276
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:34,318
-Scotch, cigarettes....
-The bonsais, Chihuahua....

277
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,287
I've been in therapy for three weeks but--

278
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:40,325
What the hell does she want with half a boat?

279
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,456
Okay, okay, you can be shirts and I'll be skins.

280
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,225
I'll be skins!

281
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,377
How you holding up there, tiger?

282
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:05,214
Sorry. When my parents got divorced, I got a lot of ''tigers.''

283
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,412
I got a lot of ''champs,'' ''chiefs,'' ''sports.''

284
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,382
I even got a ''governor.''

285
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:16,225
This is it, isn't it? This is what my life will be like.

286
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:21,332
My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas.

287
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,202
She gets the house, he's in a condo my sister will decorate with wicker.

288
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:31,208
Chandler, how did you get through this?

289
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:40,241
I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and wetting the bed.

291
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,320
You know, I just-- It's so weird.

292
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:49,225
I mean, I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other.

293
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:53,355
All I kept thinking about was the Fourth of July.

294
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:58,369
It reminded you of the way our forefathers bitched at each other?

295
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:05,209
It's just this thing. Every year we would go on my dad's boat and watch fireworks.

297
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,371
Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big.

298
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:16,277
My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and Dad would be upset because nobody helped.

300
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:21,189
And when we helped, he'd scream at us for doing it wrong.

301
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:27,229
But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up.

302
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,392
You know, and it'd get really cold.

303
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:33,335
And we'd all just sort of smoosh under this one blanket.

304
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:37,398
It never occurred to anybody to bring another one.

305
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,311
And now it's....

306
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:46,315
Yeah, I know.

307
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,433
Thanks for coming. Hope you had fun.

308
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:16,242
All right, I'm hitting the road. I've left my 10 verbs on the table.

309
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,442
Be sure and send me that finished poem.

310
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,474
Okay, will do. Glad you came.

311
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,249
I think I saw Rachel out in the hall?

312
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:25,245
Let me check.

313
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,874
Your mom wants to say goodbye.

314
00:20:28,874 --> 00:20:31,257
Happy birthday, sweetie.

315
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,290
You drive safe.

316
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,366
What are you doing?

317
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:43,304
I'm getting ready for the water-skiing.

318
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:47,277
Okay, big hug. One more. Come on, big hug!

319
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,505
How are you?

320
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:53,296
Where are you going?

321
00:20:53,296 --> 00:20:54,308
For my coat.

322
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,284
We'll get it for you.

323
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,414
All right, all right. I can get my own coat.

324
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,332
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.

325
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,535
Oh, no. No, you're not supposed to be here.

326
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:19,267
This is the staging area. It's wrong. You should leave.

327
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:22,438
You know, just get out.

328
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:34,257
Or perhaps you'd like a crème de menthe.

329
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,384
I have to head to my chateau.

330
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,396
I guess we're going into the hallway again.

331
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,399
Thanks for coming, Mrs. Greene.

332
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,279
Okay.

333
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:57,280
You take care.

334
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:02,216
Oh, you kids.

335
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:05,450
Well.

336
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:10,361
This is the best party I've been to in years.

337
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,363
Thank you!

338
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,461
Okay, everybody, time for flan!

339
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:24,265
Yep! Get ready for the gelatinous fun.

340
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:27,539
Looks like what you get when you get an infection.

341
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,474
Okay, that's enough.

342
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:33,445
Okay, Rachel, make a special flan wish.

343
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,379
Okay, I've got one.

344
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,249
Heads up!

345
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:47,356
Wow! Those things almost never come true.
