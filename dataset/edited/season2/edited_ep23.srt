1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:05,278
Chandler, Mon, there's only one muffin left.

2
00:00:05,355 --> 00:00:06,919
I ordered mine first.

3
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:08,483
Yeah, but I'm so much faster.

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,372
Give it to me.

5
00:00:11,372 --> 00:00:12,384
No.

6
00:00:13,296 --> 00:00:15,264
Give it to me!

7
00:00:15,365 --> 00:00:17,458
Okay, you can have it.

8
00:00:24,574 --> 00:00:28,271
There you go. Enjoy your coffee.

9
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:31,279
That was there when I got here.

10
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:37,285
Hey, you'll never guess who's coming to New York.

11
00:00:37,387 --> 00:00:39,378
Tell us before he can swallow.

12
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:42,390
Ryan, that guy I dated who's in the Navy.

13
00:00:43,427 --> 00:00:45,418
You dated a guy in the Navy?

14
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:48,327
I met him while playing guitar.

15
00:00:48,432 --> 00:00:51,492
Ryan threw in saltwater taffy. He had no change.

16
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,396
Is that when you wrote ''Saltwater Taffy Man''?

17
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:03,439
He's my submarine guy. He resurfaces every couple years and we have an amazing three days together.

19
00:01:03,547 --> 00:01:08,382
Only, he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yea!

20
00:01:10,353 --> 00:01:14,449
So, wait, this guy goes down for, like, two years at a time?

21
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,490
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.

22
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:25,264
Hi.

23
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,481
Oh, no. What happened?

24
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:29,460
Ben's got the chickenpox.

25
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:34,402
So if you haven't had it, chances are you will.

26
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:35,428
I've had it.

27
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,378
I've had it.

28
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,469
Had it.

29
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:41,416
I've never had it. I feel so left out. Oh, look!

30
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:37,372
Honey, you made the bed again.

31
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:40,500
You don't have to do that. This isn't camp.

32
00:02:41,278 --> 00:02:45,305
I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for.

33
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:51,379
Okay, I'm taking a shower. Today I'll sing Jim Croce's ''Leroy Brown.''

34
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,526
Hey, Mon, I have a question.

35
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:12,272
Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man?

37
00:03:12,342 --> 00:03:16,369
The baddest. Or the song would be ''Fat, Fat Leroy Brown.''

38
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:19,372
What are you doing?

39
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,275
I'm just waiting for you, sweetie.

40
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,446
Are you remaking the bed?

41
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:31,452
I'm sorry. The way you did it, it was just fine.

42
00:03:31,494 --> 00:03:34,292
Then you're redoing it because...?

43
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:36,298
You'll think I'm crazy.

44
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:39,460
You're pretty much running that risk either way.

45
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:50,278
Okay. You see the duvet tag shouldn't be at the top left corner it should be at the bottom right corner.

48
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,426
It's not crazy.

49
00:03:51,426 --> 00:03:52,472
I'm easing you in.

50
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,472
All right.

51
00:03:55,385 --> 00:04:04,250
You see these flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down because the head of the bed is where the sun would be.

53
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:10,265
You don't love me anymore, do you?

54
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:14,426
Actually, if it's possible, I love you more.

55
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,532
Really?

56
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:20,334
Wow. Well, then, come on!

57
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:24,436
I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.

58
00:04:28,285 --> 00:04:33,288
Look, if you need something I can get you a job here as a processor.

60
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,307
Don't you need experience?

61
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:37,258
It's not hard to learn.

62
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:41,253
As far as not knowing what you're doing, you're an actor.

63
00:04:41,298 --> 00:04:45,462
Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.

64
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:48,369
Here's this morning's projections.

65
00:04:48,405 --> 00:04:51,272
Thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbiani.

66
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:54,307
Joey is a fellow processor.

67
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,274
No kidding?

68
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,414
Yeah.

69
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:04,453
I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call.

70
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,768
Where do you work?

71
00:05:06,768 --> 00:05:08,315
Well, I'm in between things.

72
00:05:08,425 --> 00:05:14,321
You know, one day you're processing, the next day not so much processing anymore.

74
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,358
I told Joey about Fleischman's group.

75
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:19,332
Fleischman's group?

76
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:23,338
Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches.

77
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,233
Are all you processors dorks?

78
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:36,445
This lipstick looks just great on you.

79
00:05:37,387 --> 00:05:39,378
You look fabulous, really.

80
00:05:39,489 --> 00:05:42,356
Yeah, are you sure? Really?

81
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:48,296
See, you look beautiful. For God's sakes, dim the lights.

82
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:51,364
I'm hideous!

83
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:53,265
It's gonna be okay.

84
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:54,463
Ryan's been underwater.

85
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:59,367
He's just gonna be so glad you don't have barnacles on your butt.

86
00:06:11,321 --> 00:06:12,447
Come in.

87
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:15,220
Hey, baby, I'm back--

88
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:17,418
Hey, Ryan. What's up?

89
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,226
What's going on?

90
00:06:22,226 --> 00:06:24,222
No, no. You have to stay back.

91
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:25,426
I have the pox!

92
00:06:28,338 --> 00:06:30,431
Chicken or small?

93
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:35,239
Chicken, which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.

94
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,412
Why aren't you at home?

95
00:06:37,412 --> 00:06:39,346
My grandma's never had it.

96
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:45,250
Please tell me you have, because oh, my God, I forgot how cute you are.

97
00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:47,448
I'm sorry, I never had them.

98
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:58,366
If I had one wish, I'd go back to when I was 7 when Jimmy Hauser had chickenpox, and I'd rub him all over my face.

100
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:02,201
Yeah, or you could wish that I didn't have them now.

101
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:03,397
Can I see your face?

102
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:06,437
You don't wanna see a face covered with pox.

103
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,236
It could be covered with lox, I wouldn't care.

104
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:12,244
And you hate fish.

105
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:16,217
So sweet. All right.

106
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,344
Okay, all right. You can see.

107
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,255
This is me.

108
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:27,455
Sorry!

109
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:29,323
I am scary!

110
00:07:29,432 --> 00:07:33,425
Sorry, the lightning was an unfortunate coincidence.

111
00:07:34,337 --> 00:07:35,884
You look lovely! Lovely!

112
00:07:35,884 --> 00:07:37,431
I hate this.

113
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:41,334
I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us.

114
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:46,245
And everything I had in mind, we had to be closer than this.

115
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:54,482
Phoebe, I've spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men thinking about this moment.

117
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:59,553
I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us.

119
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,434
Okay. This is the most romantic disease I've ever had.

120
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,829
How's the first day?

121
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:20,245
It's like you said.

122
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:24,412
It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another.

123
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:29,419
Everybody's so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady, Jeannie.

124
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:33,320
Jeannie? The head of East Coast operations?

125
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,330
Turns out our kids go to the same school.

126
00:08:39,335 --> 00:08:41,326
Yeah. Small world, huh?

127
00:08:42,372 --> 00:08:44,340
Weird world.

128
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,840
Your kids?

129
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,240
I figure my character has kids.

130
00:08:49,512 --> 00:08:54,279
There isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.

131
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,342
In acting, you need to think about that stuff.

132
00:08:57,387 --> 00:09:04,387
My character, Joseph, the processing guy has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany.

134
00:09:06,195 --> 00:09:09,289
Ashley copies everything Brittany does.

135
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:17,202
Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.

136
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,503
You know, Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid.

137
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,247
You know what?

138
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,249
Just did.

139
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:33,211
Wow, that's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.

140
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:46,781
Know what makes the itching worse?

141
00:09:46,781 --> 00:09:49,329
That you don't stop talking about it?

142
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:51,302
Fine.

143
00:09:51,302 --> 00:09:52,331
Let's just play, okay?

144
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:56,439
Good, okay. Here we go, double sixes.

145
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,243
Here we go....

146
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:05,253
Here we go. Come to Mama. Just getting ready to roll the dice....

147
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,852
What're you doing? Are you scratching?

148
00:10:07,852 --> 00:10:10,349
No. This is what I do for luck, okay?

149
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:12,911
You're scratching. Give me the dice.

150
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:14,361
No.

151
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:15,830
Give me the dice.

152
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,263
No! Here. There!

153
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,459
Look, double sixes!

154
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,395
We can't scratch. We'll scar.

155
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:26,469
I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard.

156
00:10:27,276 --> 00:10:30,370
I wanna grab these houses and rub them on my body.

157
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,947
No!

158
00:10:31,947 --> 00:10:33,414
Give it! Yeah, come on!

159
00:10:33,516 --> 00:10:36,417
You know you want it too. Come on.

160
00:10:36,486 --> 00:10:39,319
Let's just be bad. It'll feel so good.

161
00:10:39,422 --> 00:10:40,514
Come on.

162
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:44,293
Oh, God help me.

163
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:46,909
Oh, yeah.

164
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:47,523
Good. Now do me.

165
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:50,527
Do my back. Oh, come on. Harder!

166
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:52,329
There you go. Don't move.

167
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:53,324
Why?

168
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,870
Don't move.

169
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,337
What are you...?

170
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:02,275
Stop that! Stop that right now.

171
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:07,476
I might've expected this of Phoebe. But, Ryan, you're a military man.

172
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:11,343
She made me do it.

173
00:11:11,387 --> 00:11:13,355
That's a nice color on you.

174
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:16,482
Yeah, well, it comes in pink and blotchy, baby.

175
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,295
I hope you get a weenie pock.

176
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:27,268
You and Milton have to join us on the boat.

177
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,418
We'll make a day of it.

178
00:11:29,418 --> 00:11:31,466
That sounds lovely. We'll set it up.

179
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:35,273
I better get back. Hope the baby feels better.

180
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:36,909
Thanks. Bye-bye, Jeannie.

181
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:38,507
Bye-bye, Joseph.

182
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:41,279
What a phony.

183
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:48,519
You'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing.

184
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:49,922
Hey, Mr. Douglas.

185
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:50,519
Sir.

186
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:55,423
Bing, I got your memo. We won't see the report till next Friday?

187
00:11:55,498 --> 00:11:58,416
My group wants the weekend for family.

188
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,334
I have a family. I'm gonna be here.

189
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:05,237
Yeah, Bing. What's that about?

190
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:11,436
It's about cutting people slack for morale.

191
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:14,478
I can get some rough numbers by Wednesday.

192
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:17,344
Rough numbers?

193
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:22,348
This company wasn't built on rough numbers. Right, Mr. Douglas?

194
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,461
Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.

195
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:28,359
If you say so, sir.

196
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:31,365
Joseph's good, isn't he?

197
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:34,395
I'm going to kill you.

198
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:40,306
Hey, I figure Joseph's the kind of guy who likes to mix it up.

199
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:43,470
You know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.

200
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,311
Why?

201
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:51,481
Look, I'm sorry, but that's what Joseph does.

202
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:56,322
Okay? If you try to pull something, he'll call you on it.

203
00:12:56,392 --> 00:12:58,587
''What're you trying to pull?'' he'll say.

204
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:05,229
Duct tape.

205
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:08,426
Was I supposed to bring something too?

206
00:13:09,272 --> 00:13:13,436
This is for the scratchy twins. I taped oven mitts to their hands.

207
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:15,858
You're strict.

208
00:13:15,858 --> 00:13:17,439
Well, it's for their own good.

209
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:22,450
You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under.

210
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:28,253
See, in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time.

211
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,359
Exactly!

212
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:35,294
God, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now.

213
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:40,267
Don't you like it better with everything on your desk perpendicular?

214
00:13:40,303 --> 00:13:43,363
If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.

215
00:13:44,373 --> 00:13:45,385
Very good.

216
00:13:45,385 --> 00:13:46,397
Thank you.

217
00:13:46,475 --> 00:13:49,273
Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.

218
00:13:49,378 --> 00:13:50,942
You're gonna do what to them?

219
00:13:50,942 --> 00:13:52,506
Set them to my time.

220
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:59,286
I'm confused. I thought we shared time.

221
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:05,324
No. See, in my bedroom, I set my clock six minutes fast. Know why?

222
00:14:05,361 --> 00:14:10,230
Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen?

223
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,379
Forget it.

224
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:12,425
No, come on, tell me.

225
00:14:13,236 --> 00:14:17,229
You don't understand. You don't have any of these obsessions.

226
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,240
No, that's not true.

227
00:14:19,342 --> 00:14:21,333
Oh, yeah? Tell me one of yours.

228
00:14:22,345 --> 00:14:23,471
Okay.

229
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:36,281
One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.

231
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,861
What if they get mixed up?

232
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:43,261
Boy, I would just....

233
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:45,357
I would freak out.

234
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,300
You would not.

235
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:52,272
I can't believe this. I hate this. You're too normal.

236
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:57,278
I can't believe you don't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.

237
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,339
See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well there.

238
00:15:07,223 --> 00:15:08,315
Hey!

239
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,938
Mr. Douglas is looking for you.

240
00:15:11,938 --> 00:15:14,418
Why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?

241
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:19,358
He has a suspicion you dropped the ball on the Lender project.

242
00:15:19,435 --> 00:15:22,336
Why? Why does he suspect that?

243
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:28,333
At first, he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it....

244
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:30,435
Turns out it was you.

245
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,314
I thought you should know.

246
00:15:33,314 --> 00:15:35,248
All right. That's it!

247
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:44,255
Look, Joey, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for you and if I could just fire Joseph, I would. But that's not possible.

249
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,261
So I'm gonna have to let both of you go.

250
00:15:48,264 --> 00:15:50,277
What? Everybody loves Joseph.

251
00:15:50,277 --> 00:15:52,290
I don't. I hate Joseph.

252
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:55,463
I think he's a brownnosing suck-up.

253
00:15:57,273 --> 00:16:01,334
Oh, yeah? Well, you can't fire Joseph. He's not in your department.

254
00:16:06,415 --> 00:16:13,220
All right, okay. So I can't fire Joseph but I can sleep with his wife.

256
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:16,347
Not Karen!

257
00:16:16,425 --> 00:16:20,259
Yeah, I'm thinking about having an affair with her.

258
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:22,263
You know what?

259
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:24,231
I just did.

260
00:16:26,469 --> 00:16:28,352
What the hell are you doing?

261
00:16:28,352 --> 00:16:30,235
Oh, it's not me.

262
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:32,239
It's my character!

263
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,240
Chandie.

264
00:16:34,477 --> 00:16:40,349
The rogue processor who seduces his coworkers' wives and then laughs about it.

266
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:44,249
I have her panties right there in my drawer!

267
00:16:44,353 --> 00:16:45,399
Really?

268
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,445
No, freak! She's fictional!

269
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,349
All right. Hey, take it easy.

270
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:54,355
If it means that much to you, I'll go find something else.

271
00:16:55,364 --> 00:16:56,490
Thank you.

272
00:16:58,467 --> 00:17:02,335
It's just that I'm gonna miss Joseph.

273
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,429
I liked him. His wife?

274
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:07,232
She was hot.

275
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:13,213
And the kids. You know he was gonna put in a pool next summer.

276
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,319
Take these off. I swear I won't scratch.

277
00:17:19,422 --> 00:17:22,220
No, sorry, hon. Monica's orders.

278
00:17:24,226 --> 00:17:26,319
Well, that wasn't easy.

279
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,423
Okay, dinner's on.

280
00:17:30,232 --> 00:17:32,325
There's a peach cobbler in the oven.

281
00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:37,270
So the plate's gonna be hot, but that shouldn't be a problem for you.

282
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:40,265
All right, you kids. Bye, now.

283
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:41,326
Bye.

284
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,310
Oh, look.

285
00:17:42,378 --> 00:17:44,312
A low-budget puppet show.

286
00:17:46,382 --> 00:17:50,284
It's a shame you can't see what finger I'm holding up.

287
00:17:54,256 --> 00:17:55,353
Wine?

288
00:17:55,353 --> 00:17:56,450
Please.

289
00:18:06,202 --> 00:18:07,299
Spilled some.

290
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:08,396
I got it.

291
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:22,411
I must say, you look beautiful tonight.

292
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:24,316
What?

293
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:27,218
Sorry.

294
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:31,325
You look beautiful.

295
00:18:47,443 --> 00:18:50,378
Okay. You know what? That's it.

296
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,479
Oh, yes.

297
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,187
Good.

298
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,322
You guys, did you--?

299
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:21,333
Monica, wake up.

300
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:23,928
What's up?

301
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:25,412
I thought of a thing.

302
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,281
Yeah?

303
00:19:31,281 --> 00:19:32,310
Yeah.

304
00:19:32,454 --> 00:19:37,323
I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.

305
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:46,267
No. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.

307
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:50,336
Or so I would have you believe.

308
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:56,468
So you have a side of the bed. Everybody has a side of the bed.

309
00:19:57,246 --> 00:19:59,441
Come on. You haven't heard my reason yet.

310
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,766
All right, go on.

311
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:03,250
Okay.

312
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:14,454
I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California, and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side.

315
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,393
Oh, my God.

316
00:20:20,502 --> 00:20:21,986
You're a freak!

317
00:20:21,986 --> 00:20:23,470
Yeah.

318
00:20:23,505 --> 00:20:25,473
How about that?

319
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,991
Where are you shipping off to?

320
00:20:30,991 --> 00:20:32,504
I can't say.

321
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:35,278
Do you have nuclear weapons onboard?

322
00:20:35,278 --> 00:20:37,274
I can't say.

323
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:40,287
Do you get to look through a periscope?

324
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:42,323
I'm sorry, but I can't say.

325
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:45,383
Wow, it's neat learning about submarines.

326
00:20:46,295 --> 00:20:47,791
I better get out of here.

327
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,287
I'll walk you out.

328
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,878
Bye, Ryan.

329
00:20:50,878 --> 00:20:52,425
A pleasure. Take care.

330
00:20:57,406 --> 00:21:02,366
So do you think we could get you one of those uniform things?

331
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:04,741
You like that, do you?

332
00:21:04,741 --> 00:21:06,237
Oh, yeah.

333
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,844
I'll make some calls.

334
00:21:07,844 --> 00:21:09,340
Okay.

335
00:21:10,252 --> 00:21:12,351
Can you believe how we spent our time?

336
00:21:12,351 --> 00:21:19,393
We didn't do anything I planned like having a picnic in Central Park and coffee at Central Perk.

338
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:22,259
Oh, I just got that!

339
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:32,269
Taxi!

340
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,406
Bye, you.

341
00:21:52,494 --> 00:21:54,291
I'm sorry, we're clo--

342
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,866
Hey, sailor.

343
00:21:58,866 --> 00:22:00,333
Is this what you had in mind?

344
00:22:02,271 --> 00:22:03,431
I'll say.

345
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:11,337
I'm shipping out tomorrow.

346
00:22:11,447 --> 00:22:17,480
Well, then...we better make this night count.

348
00:22:19,388 --> 00:22:22,448
Wait, I forgot to turn off the cappuccino machine.

349
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,291
Anchors aweigh.

350
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,403
Oh, wait, wait! My purse, my purse!

351
00:22:43,412 --> 00:22:46,279
Oh, I forgot to turn off the light.

352
00:22:46,315 --> 00:22:49,307
Why don't I just meet you upstairs?

353
00:22:53,389 --> 00:22:55,323
Honey!
