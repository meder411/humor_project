1
00:00:05,391 --> 00:00:09,452
Slow down! The paper won't be sold-out at 1 :00 in the morning.

2
00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:12,359
I'm excited! I've never been reviewed!

3
00:00:12,464 --> 00:00:16,366
You were so amazing as the king. I was really impressed.

4
00:00:16,468 --> 00:00:17,492
But you know what?

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,500
You might wanna wear underwear next time.

6
00:00:21,306 --> 00:00:26,489
When you sat on the throne, you could see your royal subjects.

8
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:28,502
No one wore underwear back then.

9
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:32,478
I'm sure the critics appreciated your authenticity.

10
00:00:32,518 --> 00:00:34,486
Nice genitals, by the way.

11
00:00:35,387 --> 00:00:36,479
Thanks, man.

12
00:00:37,322 --> 00:00:38,414
Here it is!

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:47,331
''The only thing worse than the mindless direction was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king.''

15
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:49,524
Look, that is one guy's opinion.

16
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:52,496
All right? Pheebs, read yours.

17
00:00:53,305 --> 00:00:56,433
''The only thing worse than the mindless--''

18
00:00:56,542 --> 00:01:00,273
Does anybody have one from a different paper?

19
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:02,313
Ross, read yours.

20
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:04,247
I don't want to.

21
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:10,445
''The one enjoyable moment is when the king is beheaded and speaks no more.''

22
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,484
Joey, they don't know what they're talking about.

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,349
Maybe they do.

24
00:01:16,462 --> 00:01:20,489
I've done this 10 years and I'm nowhere. There's a reason.

25
00:01:21,266 --> 00:01:23,359
Come on, you're just paying dues.

26
00:01:23,402 --> 00:01:27,463
No, no, no. It's too hard. It's not worth it. I quit.

27
00:01:28,273 --> 00:01:29,297
Come on, Joey!

28
00:01:29,408 --> 00:01:31,501
Wait, wait one minute. Wait a minute.

29
00:01:32,277 --> 00:01:34,472
I believe this will change your mind.

30
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,478
''In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiani achieved brilliant levels of--

31
00:01:40,285 --> 00:01:42,276
Continued on page 1 53.

32
00:01:42,521 --> 00:01:44,284
--sucking.''

33
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:33,404
Is there anything else you wanted to be?

34
00:02:33,472 --> 00:02:34,496
I don't know.

35
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:37,365
I used to want to be a vet.

36
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:41,470
Then I found out you have to put your hands into cows and stuff.

37
00:02:46,385 --> 00:02:47,317
Are you okay?

38
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:50,286
Just a tough day at work, you know?

39
00:02:50,322 --> 00:02:53,485
Stegosaurus fell and trapped a kid.

40
00:02:55,427 --> 00:02:59,488
I know this jacket. This is Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he?

41
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:00,395
Is he here?

42
00:03:00,395 --> 00:03:01,259
Maybe.

43
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:02,526
Don't toy with me.

44
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:04,348
Geller!

45
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:05,428
Hey, Fun Bobby!

46
00:03:06,238 --> 00:03:07,535
Hey! You been working out?

47
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:09,262
Not at all.

48
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:10,467
I love this guy!

49
00:03:12,277 --> 00:03:14,370
I'm psyched you're back with Monica.

50
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,929
You and me both!

51
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,379
So what'd I miss?

52
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:20,247
We're making Joey feel better.

53
00:03:20,352 --> 00:03:21,848
Want me to pick you up?

54
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:23,344
I'm all right, man.

55
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:25,252
I'm picking you up!

56
00:03:25,357 --> 00:03:28,349
No, seriously. I don't need you to--

57
00:03:30,362 --> 00:03:31,454
It still works!

58
00:03:32,264 --> 00:03:36,291
Okay, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up?

59
00:03:36,368 --> 00:03:37,460
I'm still gonna go.

60
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,371
Okay, I'll see you later, baby.

61
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:46,403
Public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes.

62
00:03:53,385 --> 00:03:54,335
See you.

63
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:55,285
See you later.

64
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,950
Fun Bobby is so great.

65
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,480
Oh, isn't he?

66
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:03,352
I think this time it may work with him. He makes me feel so good.

67
00:04:03,428 --> 00:04:07,262
I've been feeling lousy lately. No job, no boyfriend.

68
00:04:07,332 --> 00:04:09,425
At least my cup is half-full.

69
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:12,326
Half-full of love.

70
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,437
For our two-week anniversary, we're going to a cabin.

71
00:04:18,477 --> 00:04:21,241
Cabin of love.

72
00:04:23,248 --> 00:04:24,863
We had a lot of wine tonight.

73
00:04:24,863 --> 00:04:26,478
I only had two glasses.

74
00:04:27,286 --> 00:04:28,270
I just had a glass.

75
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,254
Two.

76
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:30,417
I had one.

77
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:36,259
I had a mug full in this ''I got boned at the Museum of Natural History'' mug.

79
00:04:37,262 --> 00:04:39,457
Okay, so that's what? Two bottles.

80
00:04:39,498 --> 00:04:42,399
And yet somehow we went through five?

81
00:04:55,314 --> 00:04:57,475
So what? So he drank a lot tonight.

82
00:04:57,582 --> 00:05:04,218
Now that I think of it, I don't think I've seen Fun Bobby without a drink.

84
00:05:05,424 --> 00:05:09,417
And did you notice how he always starts his stories with:

85
00:05:09,528 --> 00:05:14,363
''Okay, I was so wasted!'' or ''Oh, we were so bombed!''

86
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:19,234
''So I wake up and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut!''

87
00:05:19,438 --> 00:05:22,430
Have you been with him when he wasn't drinking?

88
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:26,341
We go to a lot of places where you might drink.

89
00:05:26,378 --> 00:05:29,472
How do you go to a winetasting without drinking?

90
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:34,445
Or to a club, or to the zoo.

92
00:05:39,358 --> 00:05:41,451
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?

93
00:05:42,294 --> 00:05:44,262
I don't know, taste it.

94
00:05:46,465 --> 00:05:47,454
No.

95
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:51,463
Oh, well, too late. Sorry, you already had some.

96
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:56,398
What do you say we make these coffees Irish?

97
00:06:00,312 --> 00:06:01,404
Cake!

98
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:05,314
Yeah, we're gonna get some cake.

99
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:11,445
It seems you've been making a lot of stuff ''Irish'' lately.

100
00:06:12,257 --> 00:06:17,354
I'd make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.

101
00:06:18,363 --> 00:06:19,421
Yeah, okay.

102
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:25,333
Look, maybe it's none of my business. Or maybe it is, I don't know.

103
00:06:25,437 --> 00:06:27,428
I'm kind of worried about you.

104
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,336
This isn't the first time somebody said something to me about this.

105
00:06:32,444 --> 00:06:36,278
But I always made excuses, like ''I'm a social drinker.''

106
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:38,474
Or ''Come on, it's Flag Day!''

107
00:06:41,253 --> 00:06:43,483
So, what are you saying now?

108
00:06:44,356 --> 00:06:48,291
I guess I'm saying I'll try and quit.

110
00:06:48,393 --> 00:06:51,362
I kind of like that you worry about me.

111
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:55,489
So, what's going on?

112
00:06:56,368 --> 00:06:58,302
I am gonna try and quit drinking.

113
00:06:58,302 --> 00:07:00,236
Oh! Why?

114
00:07:07,312 --> 00:07:09,439
Guess who's back in show business.

115
00:07:10,248 --> 00:07:11,510
Lorne Greene?

116
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:15,516
No. You know why? He's dead.

117
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:17,345
Oh, no.

118
00:07:19,424 --> 00:07:24,418
This is gonna seem bittersweet now, but Joey, that's who!

119
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:29,231
My agent called with an audition for Days of Our Lives!

120
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:30,881
Kick ass!

121
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:32,428
Here's to Joey!

122
00:07:33,438 --> 00:07:35,235
Here Joey.

123
00:07:38,443 --> 00:07:42,379
We have to celebrate. We should do a soap opera theme.

124
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:47,441
We could all sleep together, then one of us could get amnesia!

125
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:54,256
When do you get off? We'll do something tonight.

126
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:58,456
Well, actually, I'm already done. But I kind of got plans.

127
00:07:58,497 --> 00:08:01,295
You have other friends?

128
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,350
Yeah, I.... I have a date.

129
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,301
What?

130
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:06,870
You have a date?

131
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,337
Yes! I have a date.

132
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:10,435
With a man?

133
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:13,300
No, with a crouton.

134
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:15,828
What's strange about me dating?

135
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,211
With a crouton?

136
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,441
Rach, what about Ross?

137
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:23,346
You're still mad he made that list?

138
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:26,219
No, no, I'm not mad at him.

139
00:08:26,324 --> 00:08:29,225
I'm not really ''anything'' at him anymore.

140
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:31,278
What are you talking about?

141
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:33,229
I don't know.

142
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:36,467
Whatever I was feeling, I'm not.

144
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:38,429
You guys came so close.

145
00:08:38,503 --> 00:08:45,332
I'm sorry. You'll have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.

147
00:08:46,344 --> 00:08:47,470
Here he is.

148
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:51,272
Guys, this is Russ.

149
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,274
Hi.

150
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,324
Estelle Leonard Talent Agency.

151
00:09:09,334 --> 00:09:12,303
Sammy would you stop calling me already.

152
00:09:12,404 --> 00:09:16,340
I'm not saying you're not talented. You're very talented.

153
00:09:16,408 --> 00:09:20,435
But with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left.

154
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:23,305
Honey, give me a break, will you?

155
00:09:23,348 --> 00:09:25,248
I'll talk to you later.

156
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:29,447
There's my favorite client. Tell me, darling, how was the audition?

157
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:34,248
I think it went well. I got a callback for Thursday.

158
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:36,338
Joey! Have you ever seen me ecstatic?

159
00:09:36,338 --> 00:09:38,317
No.

160
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,331
Well, here it is.

161
00:09:44,436 --> 00:09:48,372
Listen, there's something I want to talk to you about.

162
00:09:48,473 --> 00:09:50,373
The casting lady--

163
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:52,273
Oh, isn't Lori a doll?

164
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:59,376
Yeah, she's great, but I kind of got the feeling that she was sort of coming on to me.

166
00:09:59,451 --> 00:10:04,252
And I definitely would get the part if I were to, you know....

167
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,487
If I sent the little general in.

168
00:10:13,298 --> 00:10:21,466
I see! Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's going on and straighten it out.

170
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:23,501
Lori, please.

171
00:10:25,477 --> 00:10:27,377
Hi, darling!

172
00:10:27,412 --> 00:10:33,317
How about Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cabdriver? Isn't he terrific?

173
00:10:37,322 --> 00:10:39,381
Okay, doll, talk to you later.

174
00:10:39,491 --> 00:10:42,483
You're gonna have to sleep with her.

175
00:10:45,497 --> 00:10:46,492
What's the matter?

176
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:47,487
Fun Bobby.

177
00:10:47,532 --> 00:10:49,028
What? Isn't he sober?

178
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:50,524
He's sober, all right.

179
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:54,430
Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.

180
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,240
All right, here you go, sweetie.

181
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:04,347
Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?

182
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:06,440
Oh, God, yes!

183
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:13,253
There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.

184
00:11:15,293 --> 00:11:17,261
That is funny.

185
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:22,398
I needed to buy a hammer and I'm out walking around the neighborhood.

186
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:28,370
And I'm walking, and I'm walking and I'm walking, and I'm walking--

188
00:11:28,473 --> 00:11:31,374
So you're saying you were walking.

189
00:11:31,476 --> 00:11:37,381
Apparently, no hardware stores are open past midnight in the Village.

190
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,514
So it's a helpful fact as well as funny.

192
00:11:51,496 --> 00:11:54,294
Don't you have your interview?

193
00:11:54,332 --> 00:11:55,492
Oh, yeah.

194
00:11:58,436 --> 00:11:59,886
See you guys.

195
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:04,374
Bye ridiculously dull Bobby.

197
00:12:05,276 --> 00:12:06,334
Oh, my God.

198
00:12:06,478 --> 00:12:08,361
He's not that bad.

199
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,244
Not that bad?

200
00:12:10,281 --> 00:12:12,329
Did you not hear the hammer story?

201
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:14,377
Okay, don't get all squinky.

202
00:12:16,287 --> 00:12:19,256
Maybe you had to be there.

203
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,283
But I'm gonna be there! For the rest of my life.

204
00:12:24,462 --> 00:12:28,364
I made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.

205
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,491
Don't say that.

206
00:12:30,268 --> 00:12:34,500
He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.

207
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:38,270
Hi.

208
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,265
Hey, Ross.

209
00:12:40,512 --> 00:12:45,313
Hi, Russ. I've got two more tables to clean, and then we'll go.

210
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:54,390
I'll just sit here and chat with your friend-type people.

213
00:12:59,397 --> 00:13:00,455
Rachel?

214
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,359
You know what you're doing, right?

215
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,449
Waitressing?

216
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:09,428
Well, yeah. But, no. I mean....

217
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:12,471
Doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?

218
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:16,344
Bob Saget?

219
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:18,347
Oh, yeah!

220
00:13:18,483 --> 00:13:20,348
No, no, no!

221
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:22,919
Oh, my, oh!

222
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,386
What's wrong?

223
00:13:26,257 --> 00:13:30,489
She's upset because she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.

224
00:13:32,497 --> 00:13:34,362
All right.

225
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:38,462
Listen, Pheebs. This is gonna be okay.

226
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,271
Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.

227
00:13:42,507 --> 00:13:43,502
Hi.

228
00:13:43,502 --> 00:13:44,497
Hi.

229
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:46,923
Are you a friend of Rachel's?

230
00:13:46,923 --> 00:13:48,470
Yes. Yes, I am.

231
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,413
Are you a friend of Rachel's?

232
00:13:51,482 --> 00:14:01,418
Actually, I'm kind of a you know a date-type thing of Rachel's.

236
00:14:02,227 --> 00:14:03,324
A date?

237
00:14:03,324 --> 00:14:04,421
I'm her date.

238
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,424
Oh! Oh, you're a....

239
00:14:07,232 --> 00:14:09,359
Oh, you're the date.

240
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:14,228
This is actually good because if we lose Ross, we have a spare.

241
00:14:15,273 --> 00:14:17,434
You are the paleontologist.

242
00:14:18,343 --> 00:14:21,312
Yes. Yes, I am. And you are a....

243
00:14:21,312 --> 00:14:24,281
Periodontist.

244
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:29,479
See? Now they're as different as night and later that night.

246
00:14:30,355 --> 00:14:34,257
Well, I am going to get a beverage.

247
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:36,327
It was nice meeting you.

248
00:14:36,327 --> 00:14:38,295
Ditto.

249
00:14:43,501 --> 00:14:46,299
Well, I met Russ.

250
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:50,468
I didn't know we were seeing other people.

251
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:54,301
Well, we're not seeing each other, so....

252
00:14:54,512 --> 00:15:10,416
For your information, a woman at the museum who's curator of moths and other winged things...let it be known that she is drawn to me, much like a...you know.

255
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,914
I've kept her at bay but if this is the deal--

257
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,364
It is.

258
00:15:16,434 --> 00:15:18,425
Well, have a nice evening.

259
00:15:19,437 --> 00:15:20,853
Russ, you ready?

260
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,269
Yeah.

261
00:15:23,341 --> 00:15:24,308
Bye.

262
00:15:24,308 --> 00:15:25,275
Bye.

263
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,247
She's dating?

264
00:15:30,281 --> 00:15:31,339
She's dating?

265
00:15:31,382 --> 00:15:34,442
Yes, but did you see who she was dating?

266
00:15:35,386 --> 00:15:36,819
What do you mean?

267
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:38,252
Do you not see it?

268
00:15:38,356 --> 00:15:42,486
See what? I don't know what she sees in that goober.

269
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:50,466
It takes him, what? Like, I don't know hello, a week to get out a sentence?

271
00:15:51,402 --> 00:15:53,563
Annoying, isn't it?

272
00:15:56,274 --> 00:15:57,468
Yeah.

273
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,417
You didn't get the part or Italy called and said it was hungry?

275
00:16:14,325 --> 00:16:15,889
The part's mine if I want it.

276
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:17,453
Oh, my God!

277
00:16:18,229 --> 00:16:20,424
If I sleep with the casting lady.

278
00:16:21,232 --> 00:16:23,459
Oh, my God?

280
00:16:24,435 --> 00:16:28,337
Ten years I've been waiting for a break. Ten years!

281
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:33,240
I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television!

282
00:16:33,344 --> 00:16:34,436
What are you gonna do?

283
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:37,441
I guess I could sleep with her. I mean....

284
00:16:37,482 --> 00:16:39,245
How can I do that?

285
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:43,446
I've got a pop-up book that told me all I needed to know.

286
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:46,303
I never slept with anyone for a part.

287
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:48,351
Well, is she--?

288
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,876
Sorry.

289
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,292
It's all right.

290
00:16:52,363 --> 00:16:54,359
Is she good-looking?

291
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:56,355
Yeah. She's totally good-looking.

292
00:16:56,401 --> 00:17:00,337
If I met her in a bar, I'd be buying her breakfast.

293
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:04,436
You know, after having slept with her.

294
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,339
Maybe this isn't such a big deal.

295
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:17,252
The way that I see it is, you get a great job, and you get to have sex!

296
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:21,348
Throw in a tree and a fat guy, and you've got Christmas!

297
00:17:24,228 --> 00:17:28,221
I just don't think that I want it that way, you know?

298
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:30,460
I mean, let's say I do make it.

299
00:17:31,235 --> 00:17:38,340
I'll always look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or you know, the little general.

301
00:17:40,244 --> 00:17:42,542
Didn't you used to call it ''the little major''?

302
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:47,240
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.

303
00:17:51,456 --> 00:17:53,356
Something from the bar?

304
00:17:53,356 --> 00:17:55,256
Yes, I would like something.

305
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,328
No. No, thank you.

306
00:17:58,362 --> 00:18:02,230
If you wanna drink, it's okay. I've gotta get used to it.

307
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:07,294
No, really. I wouldn't feel right about it. Just some water.

308
00:18:07,405 --> 00:18:09,822
So my refrigerator light's out.

309
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,239
Scotch on the rocks with a twist!

310
00:18:13,211 --> 00:18:13,506
I'm sorry.

311
00:18:14,245 --> 00:18:16,338
We're having fun now, huh, Ross?

312
00:18:16,414 --> 00:18:19,212
Wanna do another one? Huh, Russ?

313
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:27,322
Okay. Eleven letters atomic element number 101 , ends in ''-ium.''

315
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,942
Dysprosium.

316
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,426
Dysprosium.

317
00:18:31,229 --> 00:18:33,225
Try mendelevium.

318
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:35,221
And weenie number two has it.

319
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:40,427
Unless ''Nights in White Satin'' was sung by the Doody Blues.

320
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:45,353
You actually don't see it?

321
00:18:45,353 --> 00:18:47,332
What?

322
00:18:47,445 --> 00:18:49,345
Honey, you're dating Ross.

323
00:18:49,447 --> 00:18:51,847
No, Pheebs, I'm dating Russ.

324
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:54,247
Russ is Ross. Russ, Ross.

325
00:18:54,285 --> 00:18:55,377
Steve, sleeve.

326
00:18:55,486 --> 00:18:58,336
Okay, no one is named sleeve.

327
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:01,186
What are you talking about?

328
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:05,286
Other than their names being similar, I do not see what you see.

329
00:19:05,396 --> 00:19:09,389
For your information, it's a cardsharp, not a card shark.

330
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:11,395
You couldn't be more wrong.

331
00:19:12,203 --> 00:19:15,195
You could try, but you wouldn't be successful.

332
00:19:15,306 --> 00:19:19,333
I'll get more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.

333
00:19:21,312 --> 00:19:22,762
I know your problem.

334
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,212
Oh, you do, do you?

335
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:26,439
You're jealous.

336
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:29,513
Of what?

337
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:33,417
You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.

338
00:19:34,425 --> 00:19:36,359
You're a doctor of gums.

339
00:19:36,427 --> 00:19:40,363
That's the smallest body part you can major in.

340
00:19:41,232 --> 00:19:43,359
Day one, floss. Day two, your diploma.

341
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:44,429
Listen here--

342
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:45,424
Let me finish.

343
00:19:45,469 --> 00:19:47,869
No, let me finish.

344
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:50,269
No, you let me fin--

345
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:04,853
Did Joey say what he was gonna do?

346
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:07,253
I don't even think he knew.

347
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:09,451
Would you sleep with someone for a job?

348
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:12,387
Who would I have to sleep with?

349
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:14,361
Me.

350
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,265
Why with you?

351
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:20,462
It's my game. Want the job or not?

352
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,387
Good morning.

353
00:20:25,387 --> 00:20:26,399
Where you going?

354
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:30,379
Bobby and I are going away for the weekend. Remember?

355
00:20:31,282 --> 00:20:32,846
What's with all the liquor?

356
00:20:32,846 --> 00:20:34,410
Excuse me, miss.

357
00:20:34,518 --> 00:20:39,478
In a water landing, can this seat be used as a flotation device?

358
00:20:40,491 --> 00:20:43,289
Is Bobby drinking again?

359
00:20:43,394 --> 00:20:46,488
This is not for him. This is for me.

360
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:51,529
That way, he's sober but I find his shoelace stories more amusing.

361
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,501
God! Even his knock is boring!

362
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:02,909
I'll be ready in a second.

363
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:04,439
Could I talk to you?

364
00:21:04,482 --> 00:21:05,471
Sure.

365
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:09,282
This is hard to say.

366
00:21:09,387 --> 00:21:11,321
You fell off the wagon!

367
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:13,255
Oh, no, no.

368
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:14,420
It's about you.

369
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,483
What about me?

370
00:21:16,394 --> 00:21:19,454
I think you may have a drinking problem.

371
00:21:22,266 --> 00:21:23,358
What, these?

372
00:21:23,467 --> 00:21:26,459
No, these are for cuts and scrapes.

373
00:21:28,306 --> 00:21:33,369
Look, I'm not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now.

374
00:21:33,477 --> 00:21:35,502
Oh, shoot.

375
00:21:37,481 --> 00:21:40,416
Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.

376
00:21:40,484 --> 00:21:42,418
Okay.

377
00:21:45,323 --> 00:21:46,318
Take care.

378
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:47,313
Okay. You too.

379
00:21:47,425 --> 00:21:48,483
Bye.

380
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,378
What happened?

381
00:21:54,378 --> 00:21:56,426
Well, we kind of broke up.

382
00:22:03,441 --> 00:22:05,409
Does anybody want these?

383
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:07,377
I'll take one.

384
00:22:07,445 --> 00:22:12,280
Sometimes I hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.

385
00:22:15,486 --> 00:22:16,919
Hey.

386
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,352
How'd the callback go?

387
00:22:18,456 --> 00:22:22,358
It was unbelievable. I walked in and she was all over me.

388
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,455
So?

389
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:24,450
I couldn't do it.

390
00:22:24,562 --> 00:22:26,410
I didn't want the part that way.

391
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,258
Good for you!

392
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:33,495
Wait! After I left her office she caught up with me and offered a bigger part.

394
00:22:34,372 --> 00:22:35,361
So, and?

395
00:22:35,406 --> 00:22:45,312
So, you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramoray, neurosurgeon recurring in at least four episodes!

397
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:47,407
All right, I gotta go shower.

398
00:23:00,331 --> 00:23:01,827
Hi.

399
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:03,323
Oh, hey.

400
00:23:03,367 --> 00:23:05,363
I guess you heard Rachel dumped me.

401
00:23:05,363 --> 00:23:07,359
Yeah, I'm sorry, man.

402
00:23:07,438 --> 00:23:10,430
She said I remind her too much of somebody.

403
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:14,274
Any idea who she's talking about?

404
00:23:14,378 --> 00:23:17,347
Oh, I do. It's Bob Saget.

405
00:23:19,283 --> 00:23:21,251
She hates him.

406
00:23:21,352 --> 00:23:22,364
Hey.

407
00:23:22,364 --> 00:23:23,376
Hey, Julie!

408
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:25,352
How are you doing?

409
00:23:25,456 --> 00:23:31,290
I don't know. It's weird not being with Ross but I guess I'm doing okay.

411
00:23:31,362 --> 00:23:34,456
Actually, I've got some of his stuff that he....

412
00:23:42,273 --> 00:23:43,319
Have we met?

413
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:44,365
I don't think so.

414
00:23:44,475 --> 00:23:47,273
You look so familiar.

415
00:23:48,312 --> 00:23:52,510
Well, maybe we could talk about it over a cup of coffee.

416
00:23:53,284 --> 00:23:55,411
Know what? I'm sick of coffee.

417
00:23:55,486 --> 00:23:58,284
Let's go get us some juice.

418
00:23:58,322 --> 00:23:58,919
All right.

419
00:23:58,919 --> 00:23:59,516
Okay.

420
00:24:00,257 --> 00:24:01,354
Bye.

421
00:24:01,354 --> 00:24:02,451
Bye.
