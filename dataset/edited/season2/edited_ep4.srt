1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:04,235
Mom, would you relax?

2
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:08,365
That was 10 blocks from here, she was walking alone at night.

3
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:10,340
I would never do that.

4
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:13,275
Mom, come on, stop worrying.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,440
This is a safe street, safe building. Nothing--

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,445
Oh, my God! What are you doing in here?

7
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:21,283
Mom, I gotta go.

8
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:25,449
Oh, my God.

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,453
That's fine, just read the paper.

10
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,365
I'm gonna get a pot.

11
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,467
It's not for you.

12
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:42,366
Okay, that's fine.

13
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:49,510
Read the ''Family Circus'' enjoy the gentle comedy....

15
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:56,421
Oh, my God, my God, my God, my God....

16
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,264
It's open, you guys.

17
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:10,431
Hi.

18
00:01:10,431 --> 00:01:11,426
Hi. Can I help you?

19
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,229
Does Phoebe still live here?

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,433
No. I can get a message to her.

21
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,478
Great! Just tell her her husband stopped by.

22
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,372
Her what?

23
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,347
How did you do that?

24
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,433
This is unbelievable, Pheebs. How can you be married?

25
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:25,956
I'm not ''married'' married. He's a friend, and he's gay and he needed a green card.

27
00:02:25,956 --> 00:02:28,436
I can't believe you married Duncan.

28
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:32,440
How could you not tell me? We told each other everything.

29
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:37,455
I'm sorry. I knew if I told you, you'd get judgmental and not approve.

30
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,548
Of course I wouldn't approve.

31
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:45,287
You were in love with this guy who was gay. What were you thinking?

32
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:48,367
See? And you thought she'd be judgmental.

33
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,497
I wasn't in love with him. I was helping a friend.

34
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,367
When he left, you were in your pajamas for a month.

35
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,410
I saw you eat a cheeseburger.

36
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,307
Well, didn't you?

37
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,241
I might have.

38
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,252
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

39
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,818
Like you tell me everything?

40
00:03:10,818 --> 00:03:12,314
What haven't I?

41
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,248
I don't know.

42
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:21,460
The fact that the underwear out on the telephone pole is yours from sex with Bobby on the terrace.

44
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,259
What?

45
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,336
Wait. Who told you?

46
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,375
You are dead meat.

47
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,338
I didn't know it was a big secret.

48
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,448
Oh, it's not big. Not at all.

49
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:42,251
Kind of the same as I don't know, having a third nipple!

51
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,448
You have a third nipple?

52
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,361
You bitch!

53
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,298
Whip it out! Whip it out!

54
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,459
There's nothing to see. It's a tiny bump. It's useless.

55
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:02,241
As opposed to your multi-functional nipples?

56
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,435
I can't believe you. You said it was a nubbin.

57
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,347
Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?

58
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:15,444
You see something, you hear a word, I thought that was it.

59
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:17,735
Let me see it again.

60
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:19,248
Yes, show us your nubbin.

61
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,258
Joey was in a porno movie.

62
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,433
If I'm going down, I'm taking everybody.

63
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,247
Oh, my God.

64
00:04:30,247 --> 00:04:31,259
You were in a porno?

65
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:36,436
I was young and I wanted a job. But I couldn't go through with it.

66
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:43,249
I was the guy who fixes the copier but can't because there's people having sex on it.

68
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,443
That is wild!

69
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,282
How's it shaped?

70
00:04:48,282 --> 00:04:49,277
Is it hairy?

71
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,482
What happens if you flick it?

72
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:02,291
So does it do anything, you know, special?

73
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:08,431
Pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.

75
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:13,438
In some cultures, having a third nipple is a sign of virility.

76
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:17,239
You get the best huts, and women dance naked.

77
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,443
Are any of these cultures, perchance, in the Tri-State area?

78
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:27,224
You know, you are so amazing. Is there anything you don't know?

79
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:32,330
''Julie's so smart!'' ''Julie's so special!''

80
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:36,459
Does she put an outfit on at night and go out and fight crime?

81
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:40,262
I wanted you with Ross as much as you did.

82
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,467
But he's with her now. You'll have to get over it.

83
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,472
Oh, I'm gonna have to get over it.

84
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:50,374
I didn't know that's what I had to do.

85
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,344
I'm gonna have to write that down on my hand.

86
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,287
Sassy lady!

87
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:01,282
Where are you going?

88
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:05,194
To meet Duncan. He's skating tonight at the Garden.

89
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,232
He's in the Capades.

90
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,851
The Ice Capades?

91
00:06:09,851 --> 00:06:11,301
No, the Gravel Capades.

92
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:17,232
The turns aren't as fast, but when Snoopy falls, funny.

93
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:22,312
I can't believe you dressed up. You're setting yourself up again.

94
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,213
Okay, no.

95
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:29,416
For your information, I'm seeing him to put those feelings behind me.

96
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:36,421
The reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.

98
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,356
Darn it, we're all out of milk.

99
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:43,266
Chandler, would you fill me up here?

100
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:53,444
I see, I see. Because of the third-nipple thing.

101
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,278
Sweetie, I'll see you later.

102
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,886
See you later, Rach.

103
00:07:05,886 --> 00:07:07,382
Bye-bye, Julie.

104
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,235
Come on, cut it out.

105
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,274
Hey.

106
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:23,241
What?

107
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,356
Can I ask you something?

108
00:07:25,356 --> 00:07:26,402
Sure.

109
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:29,439
What?

110
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,946
Come on, talk to me.

111
00:07:31,946 --> 00:07:33,442
Okay.

112
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:43,260
What's the longest you've been in a relationship before...having the sex?

114
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,231
Why? Who's not--? Are you and Julie not--?

115
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,325
You and Julie not having sex?

116
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,468
Technically? No.

117
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:00,210
Is it because she's so cold in bed?

118
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:05,410
Or because she's kind of bossy, makes it feel like school?

119
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,188
No! She's great. It's not like we haven't done anything.

120
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,192
We do plenty of other stuff. Lots of other stuff like--

121
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,489
No! Don't need to know the details.

122
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,229
No, it's just....

123
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,231
It's me.

124
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:29,431
I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian.

126
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:33,403
So now I've got myself all psyched out.

127
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:39,315
It's become, like, this...this thing!

129
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,218
You must just think I'm weird.

130
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,258
No, I don't think it's weird.

131
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,453
I think, in fact....

132
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,326
In fact, you know what I think?

133
00:08:51,326 --> 00:08:52,423
What?

134
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,232
I think it's sexy.

135
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,358
Sexy?

136
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:06,472
Let me tell you something. As a woman, there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.

138
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,677
No kidding?

139
00:09:10,677 --> 00:09:13,174
You know what I'd do? I'd wait.

140
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,716
You'd wait?

141
00:09:15,716 --> 00:09:19,324
Absolutely. I would wait and wait....

143
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,385
Then I'd wait some more.

144
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,386
Really?

145
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:33,433
I don't care if she says she wants it, she begs, she pleads she tells you she's gonna have sex with another man--

147
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,401
That just means it's working.

148
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,304
Women really want this?

149
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,314
More than jewelry.

150
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,267
Phoebe!

151
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,331
Look at you! You look great.

152
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,466
Do I? Thank you.

153
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,407
So do you. Sparkly.

154
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:13,470
Thanks.

155
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:22,379
This is pretty wonderful, Mr. Major Capades Guy.

156
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:28,393
I remember when you were just King Friday in Mr. Rogers' Ice Is Nice.

157
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,486
You always said I'd make it.

158
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,562
Well, I'm kind of spooky that way.

159
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,493
Gosh, I missed you.

160
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,003
I'm gonna get changed.

161
00:10:43,003 --> 00:10:44,499
Okay.

162
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,377
Now.

163
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,474
Oh! Right. Okay.

164
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,375
Olé!

165
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,276
What?

166
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,288
The Matador....

167
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,321
Olé!

168
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,236
Sweetie, can you hold this for a second?

169
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:20,809
Julie?

170
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:21,372
Yeah.

171
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,340
Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face.

172
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,282
It's gone now. You're all right.

173
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,254
Hi, everyone.

174
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:36,291
I wanted to thank you for our little talk before.

175
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,490
No problem. So you're going with the waiting thing?

176
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:43,394
I was going to, but after you, I talked to Joey.

177
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,375
Good. What did he say?

178
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,310
He told me to get over myself and do it.

179
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,272
I thought about what you said and he said.

180
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:00,308
And his way, I get to have sex tonight, so....

181
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,420
What is this in my pocket?

182
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,355
Why, it's Joey's porno movie.

183
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,259
Pop it in.

184
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:23,367
I'm fine, if you're okay watching a video filled with two-nippled people.

185
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:29,280
People having sex. Just what I need.

186
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,441
What's wrong with people having sex?

187
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:43,454
Well, you know, these movies are offensive and degrading to women and females....

189
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,490
And the lighting's always unflattering.

190
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:52,950
Monica, help me out here.

191
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,497
Hell, I wanna see Joey!

192
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:05,440
So is there a story? Or do they just start doing it right--?

193
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,514
Oh. Never mind.

194
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,448
Wait. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.

195
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,223
I say, she'd better get the job.

196
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:19,322
Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.

197
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,459
Here I come.

198
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,463
I come to fix the copier.

199
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:29,367
I can't get to the copier. I'm thinking, ''What do I do?''

200
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:33,240
So I just watch them have sex.

201
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,247
Wait. Here's my line.

202
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:41,344
You know, that's bad for the paper tray.

203
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,481
Nice work, my friend.

204
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:48,488
You see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.

205
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:53,490
There I am. There I am. There I am....

206
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,232
So, what's up? You came to see me yesterday.

207
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,308
I kind of need a divorce.

208
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,352
Okay.

209
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,450
How come?

210
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,225
Actually, I'm getting married again.

211
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,316
What?

212
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,419
I don't know how to say this.

213
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,426
I'm straight.

214
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:36,271
I don't understand. How can you be straight?

215
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:41,473
You're so smart and funny and you throw great Academy Award parties.

216
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,375
That's what I kept telling myself.

217
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,352
You reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.

218
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,447
How long have you known?

219
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:56,487
I guess on some level I always knew I was straight.

220
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,229
I was supposed to be something else.

221
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:04,429
I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay. I was trying to fit in.

222
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,437
And there's actually a woman?

223
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,439
Her name's Debra.

224
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:19,307
Well, is she the first that you've been with?

225
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:33,423
I've never told you this...but there were one or two times back in college I'd get drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman.

229
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:38,430
I told myself it was the liquor, and people experiment in college.

230
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,328
Sure.

231
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:45,332
Now I know I don't have a choice. I was born this way.

232
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,245
I don't know what to say.

233
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,343
You're married for six years and you think you know him.

234
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:58,356
And then one day he says, ''Oh, I'm not gay!''

235
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,420
I'm still me.

236
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:11,301
Why couldn't you have figured this out six years ago?

237
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,333
It still smells like monkey in there.

238
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,236
That saves us the conversation.

239
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,410
This has been great, but I'm wiped.

240
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:28,243
Me too. We should get going.

241
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,221
No! Come on, you guys.

242
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,417
Come on, it's only 1 1 :30.

243
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:39,220
Let's just talk. We never just hang out and talk anymore.

244
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,458
Rachel, that's all we do.

245
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,270
Maybe that's all we do. What about Julie?

246
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,238
What about Julie?

247
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:55,470
You have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you.

249
00:16:56,248 --> 00:17:01,208
I mean, who is Julie? What do you like? What don't you like?

250
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,379
We want to know everything.

251
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,413
That could take a while.

252
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,383
So?

253
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,391
Who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?

254
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,264
I got time to get to know Julie.

255
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,395
I know her pretty well. Can I go?

256
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,397
That's fine.

257
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,406
Let's start with your childhood. What was that like?

258
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,211
In a nutshell--

259
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,253
So, have you told your parents?

260
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,425
No, but it'll be okay. They're pretty cool.

261
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,285
My brother's straight, so....

262
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,226
Here you go.

263
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:49,233
You know what? I have one more question.

264
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:57,308
If you had figured this out sooner, and I had been around do you think I would have been the one...?

266
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,267
No. Don't tell me.

267
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:05,373
I don't think either answer would make me feel better. Here.

268
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,480
I love you, Phoebe.

269
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,397
So your brother's straight, huh?

270
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,204
Seriously.

271
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:37,444
--and my second-grade teacher was Miss Thomas my first-grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.

273
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,248
Mrs. Gobb?

274
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:43,219
No, Cobb. Like cobb salad.

275
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,317
What exactly is in a cobb salad?

276
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,224
I'm going home.

277
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,269
Boy, that Julie's a talker, huh?

278
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:00,405
Good night.

279
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:07,304
It's late. You're probably not still planning on....

280
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,177
No, I am.

281
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,309
Are you nervous?

282
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,416
I have done it before.

283
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,385
I mean, how are you gonna handle it?

284
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:25,419
Will you talk about it beforehand? Will you just pounce?

285
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:32,295
I don't know. I guess I'm just gonna see what happens.

287
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,339
Good luck.

288
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,199
What?

289
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,436
Nothing....

290
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:51,255
It is your first time with her, and if the first time doesn't go well well, then, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.

292
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,316
Okay, now I'm nervous.

293
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,229
Maybe you should put it off.

294
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:03,324
No, I don't want to put it off.

295
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:10,239
I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable.

296
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:13,277
And now I'm actually happy.

297
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,272
You know, I mean really happy.

298
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:19,383
I just don't wanna....

299
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,447
I don't wanna mess it up, you know?

300
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,285
I know.

301
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,454
I'm sorry.

302
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,263
It's not your fault.

303
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,491
Right.

304
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,393
Maybe it doesn't have to be this tough.

305
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:44,498
Maybe you were on the right track with that whole ''spontaneous'' thing.

306
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,873
Women really like that.

307
00:20:46,873 --> 00:20:48,369
Really?

308
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:54,513
I mean if it were me, I'd want you to....

309
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,515
I don't know, catch me off guard with a really good kiss.

311
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:07,421
Really sort of soft at first.

312
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:13,427
And then maybe brush the hair away from my face.

313
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:24,440
And then look far into my eyes in a way that lets me know something...amazing is about to happen.

316
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:40,295
And then, I don't know, then you'd pull me really close to you so that I'd be pressed up right against you.

319
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:51,501
And it would get kind of...sweaty...and blurry.

322
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,277
And then it's just happening.

323
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,348
Thanks, Rach. Good night.

324
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,229
Oh, God!

325
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,277
Good morning!

326
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:34,344
Well, somebody got some last night.

327
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,252
Twice!
