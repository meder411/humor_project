1
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,438
Man, I sure miss Julie.

2
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:11,305
Spanish midgets.

3
00:00:11,348 --> 00:00:18,310
Spanish midgets wrestling Julie! Okay, I see how you got there.

5
00:00:24,227 --> 00:00:26,525
You ever figure out what that thing's for?

6
00:00:27,263 --> 00:00:28,525
I'm trying to screen.

7
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:33,224
If I answer the phone, people will think I have no life.

8
00:00:33,336 --> 00:00:35,327
My God! Rodrigo is never pinned!

9
00:00:35,438 --> 00:00:38,271
After the beep, you know what to do.

10
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:40,275
Hello. I'm looking for Bob.

11
00:00:40,377 --> 00:00:43,346
It's Jade. If this is still your number....

12
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:52,478
I was thinking about how great it was. I know it's been three years but I was hoping we could hook up again.

14
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:55,280
I barely had the nerve to call...

15
00:00:55,392 --> 00:00:56,421
-...so you know what I did?.

16
00:00:56,421 --> 00:00:57,450
What?

17
00:00:57,494 --> 00:01:01,197
I got a little drunk and naked.

19
00:01:01,297 --> 00:01:03,231
Bob here!

20
00:01:52,382 --> 00:01:55,374
So, what have you been up to?

21
00:01:55,452 --> 00:01:57,386
Oh, you know, the usual.

22
00:01:57,454 --> 00:02:02,286
Teaching aerobics partying way too much.

24
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:08,355
And in case you wondered those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.

26
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:13,394
Can you hold on? I have another call.

27
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:14,784
I love her!

28
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:15,364
I know.

29
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:19,437
-I'm back.
-So are we gonna get together?

30
00:02:20,243 --> 00:02:23,337
Absolutely. How about tomorrow afternoon?

31
00:02:23,446 --> 00:02:26,313
Do you know Central Perk? 5-ish?

32
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:28,783
-Great. I'll see you then.

33
00:02:28,783 --> 00:02:31,217
Okay.

34
00:02:31,254 --> 00:02:32,448
Okay.

35
00:02:33,256 --> 00:02:36,419
Having a phone has finally paid off.

36
00:02:37,427 --> 00:02:45,325
You do a good Bob impression but when she sees you she may realize that, hey, you're not Bob.

39
00:02:45,435 --> 00:02:48,268
You see Tattoo....

40
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:52,373
Jade's fantasy is to rekindle the love she had with Bob.

41
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:56,468
My fantasy is that you talk like a normal person.

42
00:02:57,247 --> 00:03:04,209
I hope when he doesn't show she'll seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.

44
00:03:04,287 --> 00:03:07,381
Oh, my God. You are pure evil.

45
00:03:08,324 --> 00:03:13,185
Okay, pure evil horny and alone.

47
00:03:15,331 --> 00:03:17,322
I've done this.

48
00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:26,207
Yeah, everybody's here.

49
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:28,402
Say hi to Julie in New Mexico!

50
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:29,433
Hi, Julie!

51
00:03:30,246 --> 00:03:33,306
Hi, Julie. So what.

52
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:38,353
While Ross is on the phone everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.

54
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:47,253
Is there any chance that you're rounding up from...you know, from like 20?

56
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,422
We got the gift, the concert and the cake.

57
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:53,264
Do we need a cake?

58
00:03:54,337 --> 00:03:57,272
I know it's a little steep.

59
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:01,267
But it's Ross.

60
00:04:02,212 --> 00:04:02,706
It's Ross.

61
00:04:02,706 --> 00:04:03,200
Right.

62
00:04:03,313 --> 00:04:03,842
I know.

63
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:04,371
All right.

64
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,416
I'll see you guys later. I gotta go do a thing.

65
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:11,319
Okay, I'll call you later.

66
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:14,390
You're not going through with this, are you?

67
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:17,421
You know, I think I might just.

68
00:04:19,429 --> 00:04:23,331
So, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?

69
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:27,335
Well, I gotta start saving up for Ross' birthday.

70
00:04:27,403 --> 00:04:30,395
I guess I'll stay home and eat dust bunnies.

71
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:33,300
You believe how much this costs?

72
00:04:33,343 --> 00:04:41,411
Do you guys ever get the feeling that Chandler and those guys don't get that we don't make that much money?

74
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:42,730
Yes.

75
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,242
Really?

76
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:46,254
They say, let's go here, let's go there.

77
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:49,348
Like we can afford to go here and there.

78
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:55,261
Yes, and we always have to go someplace nice, you know? God.

79
00:04:55,365 --> 00:05:00,302
And we can't say anything about it, because this is a birthday for Ross.

80
00:05:00,403 --> 00:05:01,335
For Ross.

81
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:02,267
For Ross.

82
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:06,237
Oh, my God!

83
00:05:06,237 --> 00:05:07,300
Hi.

84
00:05:07,377 --> 00:05:13,315
Okay, I'm at work just an ordinary day, chop, chop, sauté, sauté.

86
00:05:14,183 --> 00:05:16,413
The manager calls me into his office.

87
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:20,178
They fired the lunch chef. Guess who got it?

88
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,282
If it's not you, this is a horrible story.

89
00:05:24,394 --> 00:05:26,328
Fortunately, it is me.

90
00:05:26,396 --> 00:05:29,229
And they made me head of purchasing!

91
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:31,199
That's so cool!

92
00:05:31,234 --> 00:05:34,294
Anyway, I think we should go out and celebrate.

93
00:05:34,404 --> 00:05:37,202
You know, someplace nice.

94
00:05:42,312 --> 00:05:43,438
Someplace nice.

95
00:05:44,247 --> 00:05:47,216
How much you think I can get for my kidney?

96
00:05:53,256 --> 00:05:54,353
You can't do this.

97
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,450
Come on.

98
00:05:56,225 --> 00:05:59,319
I can't get a girl like her with conventional methods.

99
00:05:59,362 --> 00:06:02,263
It doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob.

100
00:06:02,365 --> 00:06:05,300
Bob could be who she was meant to be with.

101
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:08,394
You may be destroying a chance for happiness.

102
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:11,265
We don't know Bob.

103
00:06:11,374 --> 00:06:15,310
Okay, we know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.

104
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:20,181
Go over there and tell that woman the truth.

105
00:06:20,316 --> 00:06:22,307
All right.

106
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:24,379
Go.

107
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:32,857
Hi.

108
00:06:32,857 --> 00:06:34,387
Hi.

109
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:36,391
Listen, I have to....

110
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,327
I have to confess something.

111
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:41,300
Yes?

112
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:46,299
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.

113
00:06:47,243 --> 00:06:48,238
How did you--?

114
00:06:48,238 --> 00:06:49,233
I don't know.

115
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:56,318
I just had this weird sense. But that's me, I'm weird and sensitive.

116
00:06:58,254 --> 00:06:59,346
Tissue?

117
00:07:00,256 --> 00:07:01,382
Thanks.

118
00:07:02,392 --> 00:07:05,259
No, you keep the pack.

119
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:08,195
I'm all cried out today.

120
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:26,270
Here is to my sister, the newly appointed head lunch chef.

121
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:28,306
Also in charge of purchasing.

122
00:07:28,384 --> 00:07:31,319
Head lunch chef, in charge of purchasing--

123
00:07:31,421 --> 00:07:35,289
Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.

124
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:41,312
Lunch chef, purchasing, own desk when Roland's not there here's to my--

126
00:07:41,312 --> 00:07:43,195
Wait! And I got a beeper!

127
00:07:43,232 --> 00:07:44,329
Cool.

128
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:45,426
Let's see.

129
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:48,326
That's fine, I'll just wait.

130
00:07:48,404 --> 00:07:51,339
Sorry.

131
00:07:51,407 --> 00:07:53,307
Monica!

132
00:07:55,411 --> 00:07:58,437
Are we ready to order? We haven't even looked.

133
00:07:59,215 --> 00:08:00,375
When you do, let me know.

134
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,142
I'll be over there on the edge of my seat.

135
00:08:09,192 --> 00:08:10,352
Look at these prices!

136
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,288
Yeah, these are pretty cha-ching.

137
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:18,163
I know. What are these, famous chickens?

138
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:20,265
Sorry I'm late. Congratulations.

139
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:21,362
Thanks.

140
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:25,407
I'm not sorry. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?

141
00:08:26,175 --> 00:08:30,168
Pretty incredible, according to the message on my machine.

142
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:34,306
Why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?

143
00:08:34,383 --> 00:08:42,282
I told her my number was yours. I couldn't say it was mine because she thinks my number is Bob's number.

145
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:46,386
Tell me again. What do I do when Mr. Roper calls?

146
00:08:48,331 --> 00:08:49,320
Do I dare ask?

147
00:08:49,432 --> 00:08:53,232
I'll start with carpaccio, then the grilled prawns.

148
00:08:53,336 --> 00:08:55,236
Sounds great, same for me.

149
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:56,868
And for the gentleman?

150
00:08:56,868 --> 00:08:58,398
I'll have the Thai pizza.

151
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:03,372
But if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?

152
00:09:04,247 --> 00:09:06,374
You'd think, wouldn't you?

153
00:09:07,183 --> 00:09:09,663
Miss.

154
00:09:09,663 --> 00:09:12,143
Okay, I will have the side salad.

155
00:09:12,388 --> 00:09:15,357
And what would that be on the side of?

156
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:20,395
I don't know. Why don't you just put it right here next to my water.

157
00:09:22,398 --> 00:09:24,366
And for you?

158
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:30,406
I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup and....

159
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:34,266
Take care.

160
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:37,875
I will have the Cajun catfish.

161
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,371
Anything else?

162
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:43,310
Yes, how about a verse of ''Killing Me Softly''?

163
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,412
You're gonna sneeze in my fish, aren't you?

164
00:09:52,228 --> 00:09:56,392
Does anybody else feel like they just gave birth to an alien?

165
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,392
No!

166
00:09:58,434 --> 00:10:02,302
Plus tip, divided by six....

167
00:10:02,338 --> 00:10:06,206
And everyone owes 28 bucks.

168
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:07,435
Everyone?

169
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:10,404
You're right, I'm sorry.

170
00:10:11,213 --> 00:10:12,202
Thank you.

171
00:10:12,248 --> 00:10:14,244
Monica's night. She shouldn't pay.

172
00:10:14,244 --> 00:10:16,240
Thank you.

173
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:20,415
So five of us is $33.50 apiece.

174
00:10:21,223 --> 00:10:23,316
No. No way. Sorry, not gonna happen.

175
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:26,428
Prom night flashback.

176
00:10:28,431 --> 00:10:37,330
Sorry, I'm happy you got promoted but cold cucumber mush for 30-something bucks? No!

178
00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:44,245
Rachel just had that little salad and Joey with a teeny pizza! It's just....

179
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,248
Okay, Pheebs.

180
00:10:46,349 --> 00:10:50,342
How about we'll each pay for what we had? It's no big deal.

181
00:10:50,453 --> 00:10:52,478
Not for you.

182
00:10:56,258 --> 00:10:58,385
All right, what's going on?

183
00:10:58,461 --> 00:11:04,297
I don't wanna get into this right now. It'll make everybody uncomfortable.

184
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:06,390
You can tell us.

185
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:09,403
Yeah, hello? It's us. We'll be fine.

186
00:11:10,206 --> 00:11:11,298
Yeah.

187
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:25,216
Okay, we three feel like that sometimes you guys don't get that....

189
00:11:32,228 --> 00:11:34,458
We don't have as much money as you.

190
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,396
Okay.

191
00:11:39,396 --> 00:11:40,425
I hear you.

192
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,429
We can talk about that.

193
00:11:44,373 --> 00:11:48,456
Well, then...let's.

195
00:11:48,456 --> 00:11:49,536
Fine.

196
00:11:50,346 --> 00:11:55,443
I guess I just never think of money as an issue.

197
00:11:55,551 --> 00:11:56,916
Because you have it.

198
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,281
Good point.

199
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:04,225
So how come you guys haven't talked about this before?

200
00:12:04,293 --> 00:12:11,423
It's always something. Like Monica's new job or the whole Ross' birthday hoopla.

202
00:12:12,234 --> 00:12:17,501
I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative....

203
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,333
There's gonna be a hoopla?

204
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:27,246
Basically there's the thing, and then the stuff after the thing--

205
00:12:27,349 --> 00:12:32,343
If you feel better, we'll forget the thing and we'll just do the gift.

206
00:12:32,455 --> 00:12:35,453
Gift? The thing's not the gift?

207
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:38,451
We would see Hootie and the Blowfish.

208
00:12:39,261 --> 00:12:40,228
Hootie and the--

209
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:44,231
I can catch them on the radio.

210
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:47,359
No. Now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.

211
00:12:47,436 --> 00:12:53,365
No, look. It's my birthday and the important thing is that we're together.

213
00:12:53,476 --> 00:12:55,455
All of us.

214
00:12:55,455 --> 00:12:57,434
Not at the concert.

215
00:12:58,447 --> 00:12:59,362
Okay.

216
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,277
Thank you.

217
00:13:00,382 --> 00:13:01,377
Thanks.

218
00:13:01,377 --> 00:13:02,372
Yeah.

219
00:13:08,224 --> 00:13:12,217
So the Ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?

220
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:21,397
Monica, what's in the bag? I don't know. Let's take a look.

221
00:13:21,437 --> 00:13:24,304
It's like a skit.

222
00:13:25,307 --> 00:13:31,303
Why, it's dinner for six. Five steaks and an eggplant for Phoebe.

223
00:13:32,314 --> 00:13:36,410
We switched meat suppliers. They gave me steaks as a thank-you.

224
00:13:36,452 --> 00:13:41,355
But wait, there's more. Chandler, what is in that envelope?

225
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:47,252
By the way, this didn't seem so dorky out in the hall.

226
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:51,265
Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish!

227
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:55,428
The Blowfish!

228
00:13:56,472 --> 00:14:00,374
It's on us. So don't worry. This is our treat.

229
00:14:01,277 --> 00:14:04,212
So, thank you.

230
00:14:06,282 --> 00:14:08,216
Could you be less enthused?

231
00:14:08,284 --> 00:14:12,414
Look, it's a nice gesture. It is. But it just feels like....

232
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:14,381
Like?

233
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,241
Charity.

234
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:17,191
Charity?

235
00:14:17,293 --> 00:14:19,420
We're just trying to do a nice thing.

236
00:14:20,196 --> 00:14:24,292
You have to understand, your nice thing makes us feel this big.

237
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,234
Actually, it makes us feel that big.

238
00:14:30,306 --> 00:14:33,298
I don't understand. We can't win.

239
00:14:33,342 --> 00:14:39,406
If you all feel this big, maybe that's not our fault, it's just how you feel.

240
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:44,215
Now you're telling us how we feel.

241
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,311
We shouldn't talk about this.

242
00:14:46,355 --> 00:14:51,452
I'm gonna pass on the concert. Just not in a Hootie place right now.

243
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,447
Me neither!

244
00:14:55,447 --> 00:14:56,431
Me too!

245
00:14:56,532 --> 00:14:59,262
Guys, we bought the tickets.

246
00:14:59,335 --> 00:15:04,170
Then you'll have extra seats for all your tiaras and stuff.

247
00:15:04,273 --> 00:15:07,208
Why did you look at me when you said that?

248
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:12,380
So I guess now we can't go.

249
00:15:12,481 --> 00:15:18,181
Do what you want. Do we always have to do everything together?

250
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,211
You know what? You're right.

251
00:15:20,322 --> 00:15:22,290
Fine!

252
00:15:25,294 --> 00:15:27,194
All right.

253
00:15:27,296 --> 00:15:29,389
We're gonna go.

254
00:15:34,336 --> 00:15:38,397
It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.

255
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:46,345
Chandler.

256
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,243
Yeah.

257
00:15:47,316 --> 00:15:48,863
Jesus! Are you ready?

258
00:15:48,863 --> 00:15:50,410
Yes.

259
00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:54,411
Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.

260
00:15:56,325 --> 00:15:58,316
What? You had sex today?

261
00:15:59,228 --> 00:16:02,254
It sounds even cooler when somebody else says it.

262
00:16:03,265 --> 00:16:07,361
I was awesome. She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.

263
00:16:07,469 --> 00:16:08,401
Wow.

264
00:16:09,204 --> 00:16:13,163
I know it's been a while, but I took that as a good sign.

265
00:16:17,413 --> 00:16:19,796
Still doing the screening?

266
00:16:19,796 --> 00:16:22,179
I had sex today.

267
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:25,287
I never have to answer that phone again.

268
00:16:25,387 --> 00:16:28,220
After the beep, you know what to do.

269
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:29,416
Bob, it's Jade.

270
00:16:30,192 --> 00:16:33,491
I wanted to tell you I was hurt when you didn't show up.

271
00:16:34,229 --> 00:16:38,325
And just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.

272
00:16:39,301 --> 00:16:40,797
Bob here.

273
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:42,293
Oh, hi.

274
00:16:42,404 --> 00:16:44,395
So you met someone, huh?

275
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,305
Yes, I did.

276
00:16:46,408 --> 00:16:50,401
In fact, I had sex with him two hours ago.

277
00:16:52,448 --> 00:16:55,417
So how was he?

278
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:57,314
Eh.

279
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:05,385
Eh?

280
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:09,392
Bob, he was nothing compared to you.

281
00:17:12,301 --> 00:17:15,395
I bit my lip to keep from screaming your name.

282
00:17:18,207 --> 00:17:21,199
Well, that makes me feel so good.

283
00:17:21,377 --> 00:17:25,313
It was just so awkward and bumpy.

284
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:31,175
Maybe he had some kind of new, cool style you're not familiar with.

285
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,380
Maybe get used to it.

286
00:17:33,188 --> 00:17:37,284
There wasn't much time to get used to it, if you know what I mean.

287
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:50,305
I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.

288
00:17:50,406 --> 00:17:54,342
Yeah, I know. It's my birthday. We all should be here.

289
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,344
So let's go.

290
00:18:02,351 --> 00:18:05,149
Maybe we should stay for one song.

291
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,155
It would be rude to them for us to leave.

292
00:18:08,223 --> 00:18:11,249
The guys are probably having a great time.

293
00:18:14,363 --> 00:18:16,331
Come on, you guys. One more time.

294
00:18:16,331 --> 00:18:18,299
Okay.

295
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:19,863
One.

296
00:18:19,863 --> 00:18:21,359
No.

297
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:31,246
That was amazing!

298
00:18:31,246 --> 00:18:32,213
Excellent!

299
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:33,879
I can't believe the guys missed it!

300
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,477
What guys? Yeah.

301
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:40,388
Excuse me. Aren't you Monica Geller?

302
00:18:40,422 --> 00:18:41,804
Do I know you?

303
00:18:41,804 --> 00:18:43,186
You babysat me!

304
00:18:44,193 --> 00:18:48,186
Oh, my God! Little Stevie Fisher? How have you been?

305
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,424
Good. I'm a lawyer now.

306
00:18:50,332 --> 00:18:52,425
You can't be a lawyer. You're 8.

307
00:18:53,202 --> 00:18:55,397
Nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.

308
00:18:55,504 --> 00:18:56,971
Backstage?

309
00:18:56,971 --> 00:18:58,438
My firm represents the band.

310
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:00,236
Ross.

311
00:19:00,236 --> 00:19:01,231
Chandler.

312
00:19:02,377 --> 00:19:03,759
You wanna meet the group?

313
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:05,141
Yeah!

314
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:06,236
Come on.

315
00:19:06,281 --> 00:19:10,183
Are you one of the ones that fooled around with my dad?

316
00:19:15,257 --> 00:19:16,246
Hey, you guys!

317
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,321
Happy birthday!

318
00:19:18,321 --> 00:19:20,351
Thank you.

319
00:19:22,264 --> 00:19:24,255
How was your night last night?

320
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:28,166
It pretty much sucked. How was yours?

321
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:32,366
Ours sucked too. But I ran into Stevie Fisher. Remember him?

322
00:19:33,175 --> 00:19:37,407
Oh, yeah! I used to babysit him. How's his dad?

323
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:40,273
Good.

324
00:19:40,382 --> 00:19:43,408
Aside from that, the evening was a bust.

325
00:19:44,219 --> 00:19:46,380
Yeah, we really missed you guys.

326
00:19:47,189 --> 00:19:51,182
Yeah, we were just saying, this whole thing is so stupid.

327
00:19:51,226 --> 00:19:56,391
We just have to really not let stuff like this about money, get like--

328
00:19:56,431 --> 00:19:59,229
Is that a hickey?

329
00:20:00,202 --> 00:20:01,499
No, I just....

330
00:20:02,237 --> 00:20:04,296
I fell down.

331
00:20:05,507 --> 00:20:08,305
On someone's lips?

332
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:10,758
Where'd you get the hickey?

333
00:20:10,758 --> 00:20:12,305
You know, a party or--

334
00:20:12,347 --> 00:20:14,281
What party?

335
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:19,219
It wasn't a party so much as a gathering of people.

337
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:24,358
With food and music and the band.

338
00:20:24,426 --> 00:20:27,361
You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?

339
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:31,365
Yes. Apparently, Stevie and Hootie are like this:

340
00:20:31,466 --> 00:20:34,230
Who gave you that hickey?

341
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:37,238
That would be the work of a Blowfish.

342
00:20:39,441 --> 00:20:42,433
I can't believe it! I can't believe this!

343
00:20:42,544 --> 00:20:52,385
We're just sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers and you guys are out like partying and having fun and all:

345
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:55,479
''Hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck!''

346
00:20:58,293 --> 00:21:01,194
Don't blame us. You could've been there.

347
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:05,326
What? As part of your poor friends outreach program?

348
00:21:06,201 --> 00:21:07,293
Great, it's work.

349
00:21:07,336 --> 00:21:11,238
I don't know what to say. Sorry we make more than you.

350
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,332
We're not gonna feel guilty. We work hard.

351
00:21:14,443 --> 00:21:16,308
And we don't work hard?

352
00:21:16,411 --> 00:21:18,311
It's Monica. You paged?

353
00:21:18,347 --> 00:21:22,408
It's just that we like doing stuff that costs a little more.

354
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:23,935
And you feel like we hold you back.

355
00:21:23,935 --> 00:21:25,419
Yes!

356
00:21:26,221 --> 00:21:27,313
No!

357
00:21:30,325 --> 00:21:33,317
Leon, wait. Guys!

358
00:21:33,428 --> 00:21:38,229
I don't understand. The steaks were a gift from the meat vendor.

359
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:44,337
That was not a kickback. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing.

361
00:21:46,275 --> 00:21:48,368
What corporate policy?

362
00:21:49,278 --> 00:21:50,336
No--

363
00:21:53,348 --> 00:21:54,372
Yeah.

364
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,342
Okay.

365
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,415
I just got fired.

366
00:22:09,231 --> 00:22:11,279
Here's your check. That'll be $4.1 2.

367
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:13,327
Let me get that.

368
00:22:16,505 --> 00:22:19,303
You got 5 bucks?

369
00:22:27,516 --> 00:22:31,213
Here comes the beep. You know what to do.

370
00:22:31,253 --> 00:22:33,414
Hi, it's me.

371
00:22:36,325 --> 00:22:39,351
Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here.

372
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:47,434
It's been three years, and you're probably seeing someone but if we could have one night, for old times' sake....

374
00:22:47,469 --> 00:22:52,429
One hot, steamy, wild night....
