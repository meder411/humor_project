1
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:09,238
Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree.

2
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:13,438
And oh, my God, you should see the size of his Christmas balls!

3
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:18,442
Hey. How much did you guys tip the super?

4
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:22,351
We were gonna give 50 but we don't wanna look bad.

5
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,855
This year we made him cookies.

6
00:00:24,855 --> 00:00:27,255
And 25 it is.

7
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:30,758
You gave him cookies?

8
00:00:30,758 --> 00:00:32,254
Money is so impersonal.

9
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,357
Cookies says someone really cares.

10
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:39,302
All right, we're broke. But cookies do say that.

11
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:43,502
I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.

12
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:49,378
Pheebs, let me ask you, were these ''funny'' brownies?

13
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:51,573
Not especially.

14
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,411
But I think they had pot in them.

15
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:00,417
So who else did you tip with cookies?

16
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:03,257
The mailman, the super....

17
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:06,455
And the newspaper delivery guy.

18
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,234
Oh, my God.

19
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,351
What?

20
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:13,433
I don't think you're gonna like this.

21
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:19,376
There's a cookie smashed to the sports section.

22
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,380
He did my crossword puzzle.

23
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:29,449
Yeah, but not very well, unless 1 4 across, ''Gershwin musical'' actually is ''Bite me, bite me, bite me.''

25
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,337
I can't believe it's Christmas already.

26
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:27,369
One day you're eating turkey, the next thing you know lords are a-leaping and geese are a-laying.

28
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:32,342
Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.

29
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,366
Hey, guys.

30
00:02:34,366 --> 00:02:35,446
Hey.

31
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:41,353
Hey, Rach. I got you a little present.

32
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,397
I'll open it.

33
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:50,266
It's a Slinky! Remember?

34
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,362
Walks downstairs Alone or in pairs

35
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:55,270
Everyone knows it's--

36
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,401
Just a big spring.

37
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,958
You're still mad because of the--

38
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,438
List of reasons not to be with me?

39
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,311
How about we just call it the ''unfortunate incident''?

40
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:13,224
Gunther, you got stairs in your place?

41
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,372
Yeah.

42
00:03:14,372 --> 00:03:15,418
Go nuts.

43
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,443
Hey, guys.

44
00:03:18,443 --> 00:03:19,523
Hey.

45
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,946
What's in the bag?

46
00:03:21,946 --> 00:03:23,459
Just some presents.

47
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,262
Come on, show us what you bought.

48
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,341
You know you want to.

49
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,232
Okay.

50
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,473
This is a picture frame from Ben to my parents.

51
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,376
Oh, that's cute.

52
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:43,286
Some ''Hers'' and ''Hers'' towels for Susan and Carol.

53
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:48,350
And I got this blouse for Mom.

54
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:53,354
Ross, that is gorgeous! Look at these authentic fake medals!

55
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:59,360
Mom's gonna be voted ''Best Dressed'' at the make-believe military academy.

56
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,772
Happy ''Christmas Eve Eve.''

57
00:04:03,772 --> 00:04:05,302
You too.

58
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,404
Oh, my God! Where did you get this?

59
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:10,307
Macy's, third floor, Home Furnishings.

60
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:14,512
This is my father! This is a picture of my dad.

61
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,452
That's the guy that comes in the frame.

62
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,319
No, it's my dad. I'll show you.

63
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,396
I thought your dad was in prison.

64
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:26,364
No, that's my stepdad.

65
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:30,425
My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.

66
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,371
How have you never been on Oprah?

67
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,265
Look, see? This is him.

68
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:40,472
My mother gave me this picture before she died. Same guy!

69
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:48,448
It's a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a blue screen with a dog.

70
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,258
It's not a blue screen. It's just....

71
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:55,452
Maybe it was just really clear that day.

72
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,298
Okay, I have to talk to my grandmother.

73
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,896
Wait a minute, honey.

74
00:05:01,896 --> 00:05:03,392
Pheebs!

75
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:11,209
So I'm trying to get my boss' ex-wife to sleep with me.

76
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,335
Joey!

77
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:17,313
But when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears.

78
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,251
Esther Livingston.

79
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,246
Gone!

80
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,224
Hi, Pooh.

81
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,319
Hi, Gram. What you doing?

82
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,366
Just updating the phone book.

83
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:39,227
Gram? Can I see the pictures of my dad again?

84
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:42,341
Oh. Oh, sure, sure.

85
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:45,875
How come?

86
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,473
Just, you know, to see him.

87
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,238
Sure. Yeah.

88
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:54,386
This is the one of your father in a meadow.

89
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:59,290
And helping a little boy fly a kite.

90
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:03,190
And here he is at a graduation.

91
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,222
Another graduation.

92
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,201
Another graduation.

93
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,206
Is this really my father?

94
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:19,435
Is it really your fa--? Well, of course it is.

95
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:25,350
I smell smoke. Maybe because someone's pants are on fire!

96
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,224
All the time we've been grandmother and granddaughter you've never lied to me.

98
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:37,422
All right, that's not your father. It's a picture of a guy in a frame.

99
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,227
Oh, God.

100
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,434
It was your mother's idea.

101
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:47,428
She didn't want you to know your real father because he hurt her so much.

102
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,467
I didn't want to do it.

103
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:54,440
But then she died and it was harder to argue with her.

104
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,374
Not impossible, but harder.

105
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:02,217
All right. So he's not a famous tree surgeon?

106
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:10,490
And I guess he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?

107
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:14,425
Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.

108
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:20,195
That makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?

109
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,402
Honey.

110
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,211
Oh. Yeah.

111
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:30,204
Anyway, that's all I know.

112
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:37,322
That...and this.

114
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:44,262
This...is the real him.

116
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:57,375
I remember my father dressed in the red suit, the black boots and the patent leather belt, sneaking around.

118
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:03,405
He didn't want us to see but he'd be drunk so he'd crash into something and wake everyone.

120
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,209
That doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.

121
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,379
Who said anything about Christmas?

122
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,758
Hi.

123
00:08:13,758 --> 00:08:15,225
Anyone hear from Phoebe yet?

124
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,386
No, nothing.

125
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,811
I hope she's okay.

126
00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:20,426
I know what she's going through.

127
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,191
How do you know that?

128
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,395
She told us.

129
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:29,803
What you got there, Monica?

130
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:31,299
Party stuff.

131
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,311
Aren't you guys supposed to be shopping?

132
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:39,250
You didn't buy presents? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve! What are you gonna do?

133
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:43,311
Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?

134
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,315
I don't think the mailman liked your cookies.

135
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,352
Here are the ornaments your mom sent.

136
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:57,464
Maybe the mailman liked them. We just didn't give him enough.

137
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,297
Monica, pigeons learn faster than you.

138
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:13,309
Hey, Rach. I think I know what will make you feel better.

139
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,287
How about you make a list about me?

140
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,291
Forget it. I'm not gonna stand here and make a list--

141
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:27,332
Okay, you're whiny you are obsessive. You are insecure. You're gutless.

143
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,198
You never just seize the day.

144
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:34,195
You liked me for a year and you didn't do anything about it.

145
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:37,435
And you wear too much of that gel in your hair.

146
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:45,411
See, there, you.... All right, you did what I said.

147
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:51,412
And you know what? You're right. I do feel better. Thank you, Ross.

148
00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:01,232
Yeah, in Albany. Could I have the number of Frank Buffay?

149
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,527
Okay. In Ithaca?

150
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:08,338
All right, Saratoga?

151
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,442
Oneonta?

152
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,440
You know what? You shouldn't call yourself ''Information''!

153
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:25,246
Hello, Grandma. If that is, in fact, your real name.

154
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:29,452
Come on now, Pooh. Don't still be mad at me.

155
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,359
How's it going?

156
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:32,456
Not so good.

157
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:37,493
Upstate's pretty big. He's pretty small. You do the math.

158
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,398
Well, I think you're better off without him.

159
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,498
Honey, I know he's your daddy.

160
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:51,477
But to me, he's still the irresponsible creep who locked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.

162
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:56,479
I know. I just wanted to know who he was, you know?

163
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,323
Yeah, I know.

164
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:09,426
Okay. I wasn't completely honest with you when I said I didn't know exactly where he lived.

166
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,333
What do you mean?

167
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:17,239
He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown.

168
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:22,442
If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far. You can take my cab.

169
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:26,247
Wow! Thank you.

170
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,449
Remember, nobody else drives that cab.

171
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:34,448
Got it. Oh, I'm gonna see my dad!

172
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,461
Thank you.

173
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:42,265
Wish me luck, Grandpa.

174
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,569
Phoebe here with the cab yet?

175
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:57,313
Yeah, she brought the invisible cab. Hop in!

176
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,411
She'd better come. The stores close at 7.

177
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:05,447
It'll be two hours to Phoebe's dad's house. They'll meet, swap stories.

178
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:11,321
Even if she tells the one where she's an Egyptian slave, we'll have time.

179
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,294
Hey, here she comes!

180
00:12:13,294 --> 00:12:14,357
Hey.

181
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:26,468
Can you believe this? In two hours I'm gonna have a dad.

182
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,394
Yeah, big stuff!

183
00:12:29,394 --> 00:12:31,242
Okay, let's go!

184
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,251
Here, you have to hold this.

185
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,446
''Brake left, gas right''?

186
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:42,292
Yeah, that's my cheat sheet.

187
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:45,947
Where's my seat belt?

188
00:12:45,947 --> 00:12:47,397
There isn't one.

189
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:50,401
The paramedics had to cut through it.

190
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,217
Come on, just tell me. Please, please!

191
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:09,310
For the 1 6th time: No, I do not think you're obsessive!

192
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,417
It's hot in here!

193
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,360
Rach, get the heat. Ross, turn the heat down, please?

194
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,345
The difference between obsessive--

195
00:13:18,345 --> 00:13:20,262
Ross, the heat!

196
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:24,530
Okay! Heat, heat, heat! And I'm the obsessive one?

197
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:28,372
Okay. This way is on.

198
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:35,345
So this is...off.

200
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,845
Did you just break the radiator?

201
00:13:38,845 --> 00:13:43,455
No, I was turning the knob and here it is.

203
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,349
Well, put it back!

204
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,828
It won't go back.

205
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:52,295
I'll call the super.

206
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,490
Here, let me try.

207
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:58,362
That's right. I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.

208
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,337
Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny!

209
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,302
Hi, Mr. Treeger? It's Rachel Greene from upstairs.

210
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:12,216
Yes, somebody broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here.

212
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:16,254
Yes, it's hot enough to bake cookies.

213
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:20,255
Do you think we could have a new one by 6?

214
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:24,455
Tuesday? We can't wait until then. We're having a party tonight.

215
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,357
Okay, tip the man.

216
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:30,459
If he doesn't like our cookies, too bad! I won't be blackmailed.

217
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,535
Look, if it gets a little warm, it can be a theme party.

218
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:39,233
Here's a theme: ''Come on in! Live like bacon!''

219
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,340
This is it, 74!

220
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:49,254
Oh, so that's what this is for.

221
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:52,480
This is it. I'm gonna meet my dad.

222
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,874
This is like the biggest thing ever.

223
00:14:54,874 --> 00:14:56,489
Sure is.

224
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,288
Okay, here I go. I'm going in.

225
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,410
All right!

226
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,422
Good luck, Pheebs.

227
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,397
Okay. Here I go.

228
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,297
Here I go.

229
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,309
I'm going.

230
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:28,223
Hi. Welcome to our tropical Christmas party.

231
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,323
You can put your coats, sweaters, pants and shirts in the bedroom.

232
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:39,532
It's hard to tell because I'm sweating but I use what the gel bottle says.

233
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:46,470
An amount about the size of a pea. How can that be too much?

234
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,279
Ice?

235
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:56,287
Ice? Ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. All right.

236
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,347
Monica!

237
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,327
Monica, your guests are turning into jerky.

238
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:05,329
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable.

239
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:09,197
Hey! Get in line, buddy. I was next.

240
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:13,900
Mr. Treeger.

241
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,396
You said there was a party.

242
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:19,400
Oh. Yeah. Well, hey, welcome to our sauna.

243
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:23,211
Is it hot? My body always stays cool.

244
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,409
Probably because I have so much skin.

245
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,318
Hey, cheese!

246
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,452
Here's the chance. Monica, give him cash.

247
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:36,217
Rachel, give him your earrings. Anything!

248
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,778
No, I will not cave.

249
00:16:37,778 --> 00:16:39,228
I'm with Mon.

250
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:42,427
All right. You know how you say I never seize the day?

251
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:46,231
Even though he's your super, I'm seizing.

252
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,434
Mr. Treeger?

253
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,243
Here is $50. Merry Christmas.

254
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,542
Oh, wow. I didn't get you anything.

255
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,273
Here's five back.

256
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:02,384
No, that's your Christmas tip.

257
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:07,255
Do you think there's a chance you can fix that radiator now?

258
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:12,320
No can do. Like I told the girl, I can't get a knob until Tuesday.

259
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:16,198
Ross? Looks like he's playing baseball.

260
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,236
You mean hardball?

261
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,330
Whatever.

262
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,889
Whatcha gonna do?

263
00:17:24,889 --> 00:17:26,436
Excuse me. I'm seizing.

264
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,440
Mr. Treeger?

265
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:33,249
Here's another 50. Happy Hanukkah.

266
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:36,310
Will this help with the knob-getting?

267
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:41,256
No, the place is not open till Tuesday.

268
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,453
Am I not saying it right?

269
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,261
So you really did like my cookies?

270
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:52,360
Yeah, they were so personal. It really showed you cared.

271
00:17:56,442 --> 00:18:00,309
Nice seizing gel boy.

273
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,409
So is this mistletoe?

274
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,387
No, that....

275
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,186
That is basil.

276
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:20,289
If it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss you.

277
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,233
No, it's still basil.

278
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,341
Okay.

279
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,246
How far did you get?

280
00:18:40,246 --> 00:18:41,241
Mailbox.

281
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,312
All right, we're getting closer.

282
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,324
What's going on?

283
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,327
It's just like a whole mess of stuff.

284
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:55,264
Like yesterday, my dad was this famous Burma tree-surgeon guy.

285
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,462
And you know, now he's a pharmacist guy and....

286
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:03,197
Well, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.

287
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:11,206
Yeah, maybe! And I'll knock on the door and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad!

289
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:18,222
I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be nice to me because, you know, I'm Frank's daughter.

291
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,191
So why not go knock?

292
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:28,425
Because, I mean, what if he's not this great-dad guy?

293
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:33,432
What if he's still the dirt-bag who ran out on my mom and us?

294
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,299
Yeah.

295
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,308
You know what?

296
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:44,211
I've already lost a fake dad this week.

297
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:48,243
I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.

298
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:53,423
Pheebs, that's okay. You took a big step today.

299
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:55,391
Yeah?

300
00:19:55,391 --> 00:19:56,323
Yeah.

301
00:19:56,428 --> 00:20:00,364
Someday, when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.

302
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:04,232
And when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.

303
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,462
You guys....

304
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,441
Sorry about your shopping.

305
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:15,344
Oh, that's okay. We'll figure something out.

306
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:23,477
I know you're not going in there but would it be okay if I went in and used his bathroom?

308
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,390
That's fine, never mind.

309
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,357
Cool, snow!

310
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,261
Kind of like a blank canvas.

311
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:44,465
Ho-ho-ho-holy crap, is it hot in here!

312
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,280
Mind if I turn the heat down?

313
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,475
We could have used that kind of thinking earlier!

314
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,508
So, Pheebs, how did it go?

315
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,278
Oh, I couldn't go in.

316
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:58,351
Honey, I'm sorry.

317
00:20:58,351 --> 00:20:59,380
Are you okay?

318
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,325
Yeah, it's okay because I know he's there.

319
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,329
So that's enough for now.

320
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,455
It's after midnight! Merry Christmas, everyone!

321
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:11,327
Oh, right! Merry Christmas!

322
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:18,369
The knob was broken so I turned it off from underneath. I hope that's okay.

323
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,381
Thanks.

324
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:35,449
I guess that just leaves the gifts from Joey and Chandler.

325
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,464
Rach, these are for you.

326
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:44,458
Wiper blades! I don't even have a car.

327
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:49,263
No, but with this new-car smell, you'll think you do!

328
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,268
Okay, Pheebs, your turn.

329
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,477
Toilet-seat covers!

330
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:08,318
Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas? You guys!

331
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:12,321
And for Ross Mr. Sweet Tooth.

333
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,368
You got me a cola drink?

334
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,371
And a lemon-lime!

335
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:27,334
Well, this is too much! I feel like I should get you another sweater.

336
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,349
And last but not least....

337
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,481
They're ribbed for your pleasure!
