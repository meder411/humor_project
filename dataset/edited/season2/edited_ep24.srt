1
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:03,883
How was the audition?

2
00:00:03,883 --> 00:00:05,265
Incredible.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,497
You won't believe who the director was.

4
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:09,802
Who?

5
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:11,298
I'll give you one hint:

6
00:00:11,376 --> 00:00:13,401
Warren Beatty.

7
00:00:13,478 --> 00:00:14,467
Wow.

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,272
There's just one thing that might be a problem.

9
00:00:18,383 --> 00:00:20,510
See, I had to kiss this guy.

10
00:00:21,286 --> 00:00:23,516
Because he was just so darn cute?

11
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:28,425
No, I'm up for the part of this guy who the main guy kisses.

13
00:00:28,493 --> 00:00:33,396
Well, you're an actor. I say you just suck it up and you do it.

14
00:00:37,302 --> 00:00:38,599
Or you just do it.

15
00:00:39,438 --> 00:00:41,497
I did do it. I'm a professional.

16
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:47,512
My first girlfriend was Lisa DiBatista so I'm no stranger to the mustache.

18
00:00:48,413 --> 00:00:49,437
What's the problem?

19
00:00:49,514 --> 00:00:54,542
After the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up and says, ''Good actor. Bad kisser.''

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,346
Can you believe that? Me, not a good kisser.

21
00:00:58,457 --> 00:01:02,485
That's like Mother Teresa, not a good mother.

23
00:01:04,362 --> 00:01:06,353
Who cares what that guy thinks?

24
00:01:06,398 --> 00:01:09,458
What does Warren Beatty know about kissing?

25
00:02:01,286 --> 00:02:03,282
What did your agent say?

26
00:02:03,282 --> 00:02:05,278
The kiss is definitely a problem.

27
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:10,453
Mr. Beatty wants to see it again. I gotta find out what I'm doing wrong.

28
00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:13,463
One of you girls come over here and kiss me.

29
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:15,383
Forget it.

30
00:02:15,383 --> 00:02:16,367
Yeah, right.

31
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:18,392
Come on. I need your help here.

32
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,372
I'll do it. I've kissed him before. I can do it again.

33
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:24,408
See this? This is a friend.

34
00:02:24,476 --> 00:02:26,467
Let's go.

35
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:29,309
Oh, wait. I have gum.

36
00:02:30,315 --> 00:02:31,407
Okay.

37
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:42,392
Good. Very good. Firm, but tender.

38
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:44,486
I'd recommend you to a friend.

39
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,981
I don't know what the problem is.

40
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:50,432
Maybe you're not used to kissing men.

41
00:02:50,535 --> 00:02:54,437
Maybe you just tensed up. Maybe you need to work on that.

42
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:57,400
Yeah, that makes sense.

43
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,440
Over my dead body.

44
00:03:07,452 --> 00:03:10,478
And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.

45
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,490
Come on out. I'm telling you, you look good.

46
00:03:18,263 --> 00:03:21,357
Tell her she looks good. Tell her she looks good.

47
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:28,405
Oh, my God!

48
00:03:30,408 --> 00:03:32,501
You look so good!

49
00:03:34,312 --> 00:03:42,375
I cannot believe I have to walk in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when you're nauseous.

51
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,389
So don't. I don't see why we have to go.

52
00:03:45,423 --> 00:03:47,903
It's your ex-fiancÃ©'s wedding.

53
00:03:47,903 --> 00:03:50,383
Because I promised Mindy I would.

54
00:03:50,428 --> 00:03:53,488
Yeah, well, you promised Barry you'd marry him.

55
00:03:54,532 --> 00:03:57,524
You guys, I have to go. I'm the maid of honor.

56
00:03:58,303 --> 00:04:04,265
Besides, I need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself.

58
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,386
You have the same clothes on as last night. Get some action?

59
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:17,443
I may have.

60
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:19,388
Stud!

61
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:21,925
What's she look like?

62
00:04:21,925 --> 00:04:23,358
We haven't met.

63
00:04:23,395 --> 00:04:26,364
We just stayed up talking on the Internet.

64
00:04:27,265 --> 00:04:28,254
Geek!

65
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:32,293
I like this girl. I seriously like this girl.

66
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,498
Know how I tend to get a little defended and quippy?

67
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:37,320
Get out!

68
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,366
No! Please.

69
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,279
Well, she called me on it, okay? She said, ''Cut it out, get real.''

70
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:44,505
And I did.

71
00:04:45,317 --> 00:04:46,409
Wow.

72
00:04:46,484 --> 00:04:48,418
What's that like?

73
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:52,381
It's like this. Me.

74
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,321
No jokes.

75
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:57,290
Stop it. You're freaking me out.

76
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,364
I don't like you this way.

77
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,233
I'll see you guys later.

78
00:05:03,268 --> 00:05:03,865
Bye, Richard.

79
00:05:03,865 --> 00:05:04,462
Bye-bye.

80
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:07,288
Bye, sweetie. I love you.

81
00:05:07,288 --> 00:05:09,239
I love you too.

82
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:19,249
I think my boyfriend's ever so dreamy.

83
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:22,378
I wonder what our wedding will be like.

84
00:05:24,255 --> 00:05:26,303
What do you mean? What wedding?

85
00:05:26,303 --> 00:05:28,351
You never talk about that?

86
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,487
No, never. We're just living in the moment.

87
00:05:33,264 --> 00:05:37,291
It's nice for once not to get hung up on, ''Where is this going?''

88
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:38,933
Afraid to ask him?

89
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:40,497
Could not be more terrified.

90
00:05:41,272 --> 00:05:43,399
You should seriously consider marriage.

91
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:48,275
Give Rachel another chance to dress like Princess Bubble Yum.

92
00:05:51,383 --> 00:05:56,480
I was laughing at this quip Leno made last night.

93
00:05:56,521 --> 00:06:00,457
I wasn't laughing at your dress. I love you.

94
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,356
Where's Benny?

95
00:06:06,431 --> 00:06:08,331
There he is!

96
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:09,458
Where's Benny?

97
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:11,429
There he is!

98
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:19,333
Babies probably learn to talk so they can tell grownups to cut it out.

99
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:23,339
Hey, I got a question for you.

100
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:24,962
Just a little thing, no pressure.

101
00:06:24,962 --> 00:06:26,543
Okay.

102
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:32,245
Do you ever think about the future?

103
00:06:32,457 --> 00:06:33,970
Sure, I do.

104
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,483
Yeah? Am I in it?

105
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:39,385
Honey you are it.

107
00:06:40,465 --> 00:06:43,491
Oh, God. You're about to get so lucky.

108
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:44,866
Yeah?

109
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:45,463
Yeah.

110
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:50,371
Keep talking.

111
00:06:50,371 --> 00:06:51,468
Well....

112
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:54,478
Sometimes I think about selling my practice.

113
00:06:55,513 --> 00:06:58,482
We could move to France.

114
00:06:59,284 --> 00:07:00,410
Make French toast.

115
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:08,517
Okay, so we're in France...and we're making the toast.

118
00:07:10,261 --> 00:07:13,424
Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?

119
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:15,365
Like a hound?

120
00:07:17,368 --> 00:07:19,268
Not a basset.

121
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:21,234
A bassinet.

122
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:25,368
You really need the bassinet?

123
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:29,538
Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog.

124
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:35,283
Do you not see kids in our future?

125
00:07:36,454 --> 00:07:38,285
I love children.

126
00:07:38,456 --> 00:07:40,287
I have children.

127
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:46,490
I don't wanna be 70 when our kids go to college and our life can finally start.

129
00:07:51,302 --> 00:07:54,362
I want you now.

131
00:07:55,473 --> 00:07:57,304
Well, that's great.

132
00:07:57,475 --> 00:08:00,239
We don't need to talk about this now.

133
00:08:00,311 --> 00:08:03,405
This is so, like, way, way in the future.

134
00:08:04,215 --> 00:08:07,412
I'm talking hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet.

135
00:08:12,223 --> 00:08:15,215
Come on, Chandler. I want this part so much.

136
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,327
Just one kiss. I won't tell anyone.

137
00:08:18,429 --> 00:08:21,227
Joey, no means no.

138
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:24,332
Hey.

139
00:08:26,237 --> 00:08:29,263
I'm sorry, we don't have your sheep.

140
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:34,438
I think you look cute.

141
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,864
Thank you.

142
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:38,348
And you. You....

143
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:41,318
You, I could eat.

144
00:08:41,318 --> 00:08:43,252
Get away from me. I said no.

145
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,255
Richard's downstairs.

146
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:50,486
Richard's here? I should run down and say goodbye.

147
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:55,294
Bye.

148
00:08:55,294 --> 00:08:56,289
Good luck.

149
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:01,463
How's your date with cyber-chick? Hey, what is all that?

150
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:05,242
It's a website. It's the Guggenheim Museum.

151
00:09:05,343 --> 00:09:10,338
See, she likes art and I like funny words.

153
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:14,316
What does she mean by ''HH''?

154
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:17,320
It means we're holding hands.

155
00:09:18,423 --> 00:09:20,220
Are you the cutest?

156
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:22,316
I'm afraid I might just be.

157
00:09:25,229 --> 00:09:33,427
I think it's so great that you're into this person yet for all you know, she could be 90 years old or have two heads.

159
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:36,330
It could be a guy.

160
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:40,267
It's not a guy, all right? I know her.

161
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:43,280
It could be like a big, giant guy.

162
00:09:45,383 --> 00:09:50,252
Man, I got this close to him, and Monica kneed me in the back.

163
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:52,250
What's going on?

164
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,282
We're wondering if his girlfriend's a girl.

165
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,262
Ask how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men.

166
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:06,361
How do you not fall down more?

167
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:10,399
Okay. Ask her what is her method of birth control.

168
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:12,375
All right.

169
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,314
''My husband is sleeping with his secretary.''

170
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:21,385
She's married?

171
00:10:22,286 --> 00:10:24,277
At least we know she's a woman.

172
00:10:26,391 --> 00:10:28,404
I can't believe she's married.

173
00:10:28,404 --> 00:10:30,417
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

174
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,297
This must be really tough for you.

175
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:43,405
I read this article that says you shouldn't throw rice at weddings.

176
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:46,410
When pigeons eat rice, it kills them.

177
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:50,312
So that's why you never see pigeons in sushi bars.

178
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,912
See, we're having fun.

179
00:10:52,912 --> 00:10:54,408
Oh, absolutely.

180
00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:58,420
I'm not thinking about that thing we won't think about.

181
00:10:58,523 --> 00:11:00,354
Neither am I.

182
00:11:00,491 --> 00:11:03,255
Hey, there. Are you all right?

183
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:07,263
Yeah. But I saw the window I crawled out of at my wedding.

184
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:11,291
And I just started thinking I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't.

185
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:15,465
People will look at me and judge me and think about the last time.

186
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:20,408
It's gonna be okay. It's a wedding. People focus on the bride.

187
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:22,471
I know, you're right.

188
00:11:22,513 --> 00:11:25,311
Alrighty. Everybody look at me. Good.

189
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:30,379
It's time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines. Thank you.

191
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:33,390
I'll see you after the thing.

192
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:34,389
Good luck.

193
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:35,287
Thank you.

194
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:35,905
Okay.

195
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:36,417
Okay.

196
00:11:36,494 --> 00:11:38,394
Okay.

197
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:51,825
Why didn't you tell me?

198
00:11:51,825 --> 00:11:53,309
What could I do?

199
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:56,363
Shout, ''Hey, your butt is showing!''

200
00:11:56,363 --> 00:11:59,315
Yeah! Better you than Barry's uncle!

201
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,282
This is so humiliating.

202
00:12:01,352 --> 00:12:08,348
The only thing worse was in eighth grade when I had to sing the ''Copacabana'' to the entire school.

204
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:13,260
Two lines into it, I freaked out. My life's flashing before my eyes.

205
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:16,356
Rach, look, I remember that. It wasn't so bad.

206
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,461
Ross, would you stop! You got me. I'm dating you.

207
00:12:21,272 --> 00:12:22,836
Rachel.

208
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:24,400
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Weinberg.

209
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:27,376
It's wonderful to see you again, my dear.

210
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:30,574
In fact, I hardly expected to see so much.

211
00:12:32,483 --> 00:12:34,883
You told me you didn't see anything.

212
00:12:34,883 --> 00:12:37,283
I tell you a lot of things.

213
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:40,516
It's wonderful to have you up and about again, dear.

214
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:43,290
Stay well.

215
00:12:44,295 --> 00:12:48,493
That's the third time someone has said something like that to me today.

216
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,424
Rach!

217
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:51,951
Oh, my God, I'm married!

218
00:12:51,951 --> 00:12:53,401
I know!

219
00:12:53,504 --> 00:12:57,304
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter-Farber.

220
00:12:57,408 --> 00:12:59,342
I am so proud of you, Min.

221
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:01,343
Min.

222
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:03,244
Rach. Still here.

223
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:07,249
At our wedding, they'd packed up the chopped liver by now.

224
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:09,444
Oh, yeah, I love that story.

225
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:11,480
I have a question.

226
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,453
Why are people saying it's good to see me up and about?

227
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:23,290
After you ran out on your wedding Barry's parents told people you were sort of insane.

230
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:25,269
Insane?

231
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:27,266
From the syphilis.

232
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:28,463
What?

233
00:13:29,507 --> 00:13:33,466
What were they gonna say? You didn't love me anymore?

234
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:38,271
Your choices were that or syphilis?

235
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:42,580
Sweetie, at least this puts your whole tushy show into perspective.

236
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:45,580
Angela?

237
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:47,382
Joey Tribbiani.

238
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:51,386
Listen, what are you doing tonight?

239
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:55,431
I know you're seeing that guy. Maybe you could bring him....

240
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:57,524
Hello? Hello?

241
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:12,272
Will you answer? That's the 10th bing-bong message she's sent.

242
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,914
She asks what's wrong.

243
00:14:13,914 --> 00:14:15,478
What's wrong? You're married!

244
00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:18,245
That's what's wrong!

245
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:20,469
Oh, my.

246
00:14:20,469 --> 00:14:21,481
What?

247
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,454
She wants to meet you.

248
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:26,395
Look, Phoebe, I wanted to meet her too.

249
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:29,262
But she's married. She has a husband.

250
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:32,461
What if he's the wrong guy and you are the right guy?

251
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:35,464
You don't get these chances often.

252
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:42,369
Meet her or you'll kick yourself when you're 80 which is hard to do and you'll break a hip.

254
00:14:45,283 --> 00:14:46,307
I don't know.

255
00:14:46,484 --> 00:14:50,420
Listen. Those are the bing-bongs of a woman in love with you.

256
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,490
Okay. I'll do it.

257
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:59,491
Okay, great! Put on your shoes and then march out there and meet her.

258
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,465
No, wait! You have to take a shower because:

259
00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:04,326
And I'll get the--

260
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:07,427
No, you have to answer her. Answer her first.

261
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:11,237
No, make some coffee because it's too much.

262
00:15:15,346 --> 00:15:18,372
Okay, one more, please. I'll get it in this time.

263
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:20,382
Okay, last chance.

264
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:28,257
Again, I'm sorry.

265
00:15:32,363 --> 00:15:35,491
You know what? Maybe I don't need to have children.

266
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:45,467
Maybe I just think I do because that's what society and by that, I mean my mom...has always convinced me that I--

269
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:51,305
I do.

270
00:15:51,382 --> 00:15:54,374
I have to have children. I'm sorry, I just do.

271
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:59,312
Can I have your attention?

272
00:15:59,423 --> 00:16:01,414
Best man making a toast here.

273
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:03,324
Thank you.

274
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:08,424
I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel.

275
00:16:11,235 --> 00:16:15,331
What? You hired the same band. I can't use the same speech?

276
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:18,340
Thank you. Thank you very much.

277
00:16:18,376 --> 00:16:22,469
Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together.

279
00:16:23,347 --> 00:16:24,336
And Rachel....

280
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:26,346
What?

281
00:16:26,346 --> 00:16:27,443
No, no, in all seriousness.

282
00:16:28,252 --> 00:16:31,244
Not many women would have the guts to be here.

283
00:16:31,288 --> 00:16:35,281
And even fewer who'd do it with their asses hanging out.

284
00:16:42,266 --> 00:16:44,393
I'd like to add something to that.

285
00:16:44,468 --> 00:16:45,884
Why are you adding?

286
00:16:45,884 --> 00:16:47,300
It's okay.

287
00:16:48,372 --> 00:16:51,500
Most of you don't know me. I'm Rachel's boyfriend.

288
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:53,469
Oh, dear God.

289
00:16:54,378 --> 00:16:55,470
Ross.

290
00:16:55,579 --> 00:17:02,514
And I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight.

292
00:17:03,254 --> 00:17:10,225
And just for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis.

294
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:13,224
I'm serious.

295
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:22,305
The reason she walked out on Barry is simply that she didn't love him.

297
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:26,275
Which, incidentally, worked out pretty well for me.

298
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:34,451
So, to review:

299
00:17:37,354 --> 00:17:49,255
Rachel took a lot of courage doesn't have the syphilis and wound up with me.

303
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,296
Cheers.

304
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:53,882
See you in the parking lot.

305
00:17:53,882 --> 00:17:55,395
No, Rach--

306
00:17:57,475 --> 00:18:02,242
And once again, she is out of here! Okay, who had 9:45?

307
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:19,228
You know what, Bar? I'm not gonna leave.

308
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,331
I probably should, but I'm not.

309
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:28,235
I promised myself I'd make it through at least one of your weddings.

310
00:18:31,342 --> 00:18:39,339
All I wanted was to make it through this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity.

312
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:43,486
Well, I guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen.

313
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:52,456
I guess there's nothing really left to say except:

315
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:18,310
Thank you, honey.

316
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,427
Wait, wait! Everybody!

317
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:28,524
Everybody!

318
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:54,481
Okay. I'll do it.

319
00:19:55,392 --> 00:19:56,359
You'll do what?

320
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,362
If it takes kids to be with you, then kids it is.

321
00:20:00,464 --> 00:20:01,488
Oh, my God.

322
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:07,269
If I have to, I'll do it all again. I'll do the 4:00 feeding thing.

323
00:20:07,371 --> 00:20:11,364
I'll go to the PTA meetings. I'll coach the soccer team.

324
00:20:12,376 --> 00:20:13,422
Really?

325
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:14,468
Yeah, if I have to.

326
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:22,280
Monica...I don't wanna lose you.

328
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:27,387
So if I have to do it all again then I will.

330
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:33,295
You are the most wonderful man.

331
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:44,604
And if you hadn't said ''If I have to,'' like, 1 7 times...then I'd be saying, ''Okay, let's do it.''

334
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,307
But you're not.

335
00:20:50,514 --> 00:20:55,417
Oh, my God. I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say.

336
00:20:59,456 --> 00:21:01,447
I wanna have a baby.

337
00:21:04,495 --> 00:21:09,455
But I don't want to have one with someone who doesn't really want one.

338
00:21:11,468 --> 00:21:13,299
God....

339
00:21:18,475 --> 00:21:20,306
I love you.

340
00:21:25,282 --> 00:21:26,510
I know you do.

341
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,285
Me too.

342
00:21:38,295 --> 00:21:39,523
So what now?

343
00:21:41,532 --> 00:21:46,401
I guess we just keep dancing.

345
00:22:01,285 --> 00:22:02,479
Where is she? Where is she?

346
00:22:03,253 --> 00:22:06,245
Oh, hey, I have a question. Where is she?

347
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:09,350
Relax, Chandler. She'll be here.

348
00:22:12,363 --> 00:22:13,352
Oh, that's her.

349
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:17,263
Yeah, because life's just that kind.

350
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:19,469
Stop staring at the door.

351
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,401
It's like a watched pot.

352
00:22:21,472 --> 00:22:25,465
If you keep looking at it, the door's never gonna boil.

353
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:28,501
I think what you have to do is try not to--

354
00:22:34,418 --> 00:22:36,318
Oh, my God.

355
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:44,290
Oh my God.

358
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:57,301
Oh my God.

361
00:23:05,449 --> 00:23:06,438
All right.

362
00:23:07,351 --> 00:23:10,377
I've felt guilty because I wanna be a good friend.

363
00:23:10,454 --> 00:23:14,550
And damn it, I am a good friend. So shut up and close your eyes.

364
00:23:18,295 --> 00:23:19,455
Wow.

365
00:23:20,497 --> 00:23:22,488
You are a good friend.

366
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:26,395
Of course, the audition's over, and I didn't get it.

367
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:29,496
But that was a hell of a kiss.

368
00:23:30,274 --> 00:23:32,504
Rachel is a very lucky girl.
