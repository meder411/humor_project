1
00:00:03,154 --> 00:00:04,348
All right, Phoebe?

2
00:00:04,455 --> 00:00:12,352
If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want world peace no hunger, good things for the rain forest.

4
00:00:13,364 --> 00:00:15,161
And bigger boobs.

5
00:00:16,301 --> 00:00:19,270
Well, see, you took mine.

6
00:00:20,204 --> 00:00:21,193
What about you?

7
00:00:21,306 --> 00:00:26,266
If I were omnipotent for a day, I'd make myself omnipotent forever.

8
00:00:26,377 --> 00:00:31,371
There's always one guy. ''If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes.''

9
00:00:33,318 --> 00:00:34,410
Hey, Joey.

10
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,483
What would you do if you were omnipotent?

11
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:40,213
Probably kill myself.

12
00:00:41,326 --> 00:00:42,384
Excuse me?

13
00:00:42,427 --> 00:00:46,329
If little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live.

14
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:51,427
Joey, omnipotent.

15
00:00:52,337 --> 00:00:54,305
You are?

16
00:00:54,405 --> 00:01:00,275
Ross, I'm sorry. I had no idea. I thought it was a theoretical question.

17
00:01:50,395 --> 00:01:52,329
How does she do that?

18
00:01:52,397 --> 00:01:55,195
I can't sleep in a public place.

19
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:57,426
Libraries, airplanes, movie theaters....

20
00:01:58,236 --> 00:02:00,170
You slept at the Grand Canyon.

21
00:02:00,238 --> 00:02:04,231
Hello, Mom and Dad never took us to the Grand Canyon.

22
00:02:05,243 --> 00:02:07,370
Mom and Dad took us to the Grand Canyon?

23
00:02:09,147 --> 00:02:12,241
Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.

24
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:13,374
Yeah.

25
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:16,286
What? What? What?

26
00:02:16,354 --> 00:02:18,367
Hi.

27
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:20,380
It's okay. You just nodded off again.

28
00:02:21,192 --> 00:02:22,181
What's going on?

29
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:33,159
I got no sleep last night. My grandmother has a new boyfriend and they're both kind of insecure in bed, so-- And deaf.

31
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:38,307
They reassure each other that they're having a good time.

32
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:42,210
You have no idea how loud they are.

33
00:02:43,181 --> 00:02:44,728
You can stay with Rachel and me.

34
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:46,275
Thanks.

35
00:02:46,384 --> 00:02:49,376
--95, 96, 97. See, I told you.

36
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:52,486
Less than 100 steps from our place to here.

37
00:02:53,224 --> 00:02:56,216
You got way too much free time, man.

38
00:02:56,327 --> 00:02:59,194
There's the birthday boy.

39
00:02:59,297 --> 00:03:03,358
Hockey tickets. Rangers-Penguins tonight and we're taking you.

40
00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:05,648
Happy birthday, pal!

41
00:03:05,648 --> 00:03:07,161
We love you, man.

42
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,333
It's funny. My birthday was seven months ago.

43
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,808
So?

44
00:03:12,808 --> 00:03:17,439
So you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide who got to bring a date?

46
00:03:18,182 --> 00:03:21,379
Well, aren't we Mr. The-Glass-ls-Half-Empty?

47
00:03:22,153 --> 00:03:26,146
Oh, my God! Is today the 20th? October 20th?

48
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,220
I hoped you wouldn't remember.

49
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,250
What's wrong with the 20th?

50
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:35,163
Eleven days before Halloween. All the good costumes are gone?

51
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:44,172
Today's the day Carol and I first consummated our physical relationship.

54
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:46,376
Sex.

55
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,731
You told your sister that?

56
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,182
Believe me, I told everyone.

57
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:56,285
I better pass on the game.

58
00:03:56,387 --> 00:04:01,347
I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.

59
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,318
The hell with hockey! Let's all do that!

60
00:04:07,231 --> 00:04:11,133
Come on, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice! Guys' night out!

61
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:13,330
Come on, what do you say, big guy?

62
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:14,804
What are you doing?

63
00:04:14,804 --> 00:04:16,237
I have no idea.

64
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,740
Come on, Ross.

65
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,140
Maybe it will take my mind off it.

66
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:22,709
Promise to buy me a big foam finger?

67
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:24,239
You got it.

68
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:27,283
Look, look, look! My first paycheck!

69
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:32,254
Look at the window! There's my name! Hi, me!

70
00:04:33,157 --> 00:04:35,284
I remember when I got my first paycheck.

71
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:39,386
There was a cave-in in a mine, and eight people were killed.

72
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,298
You worked in a mine?

73
00:04:43,298 --> 00:04:45,397
No, I worked at a Dairy Queen. Why?

74
00:04:48,406 --> 00:04:54,276
Isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it. I steamed milk.

75
00:04:54,312 --> 00:04:59,178
And it was totally not worth it.

77
00:04:59,283 --> 00:05:03,151
What's FICA? Why's he getting all my money?

78
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:07,249
I mean, what--? Chandler, look at that.

79
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,218
This is not that bad.

80
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:13,230
You're fine, yeah, for a first job.

81
00:05:13,264 --> 00:05:16,165
You can totally, totally live on this.

82
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:18,327
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

83
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:20,365
By the way, great service today.

84
00:05:20,365 --> 00:05:22,361
Yeah.

85
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:27,307
Hockey!

86
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:28,370
Hockey!

87
00:05:39,357 --> 00:05:40,756
Hockey!

88
00:05:40,756 --> 00:05:42,155
Hockey.

89
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:45,352
Rachel?

90
00:05:46,364 --> 00:05:49,162
Oh, my God!

91
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:58,171
I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.

92
00:05:58,209 --> 00:05:59,403
What are you doing here?

93
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:05,343
We were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, and it's true!

94
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:12,220
Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play.

95
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:17,319
God, look at you! You're so big! I can't believe it!

96
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:21,262
I know, I know! I'm a duplex.

97
00:06:21,365 --> 00:06:27,235
Kiki, you look phenomenal. I mean, you've lost, like, a ton of weight.

98
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:33,440
And you should really, really-- It's time to stop, you look perfect.

100
00:06:34,178 --> 00:06:35,338
What's going on?

101
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:39,440
Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm?

102
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:45,452
And while we're on the subject of news....

103
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,355
Look, look! I have elbows!

104
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,267
--Passes it up to Leetch.

105
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,339
Leetch spots Messier. Here's the pass!

106
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:08,238
We'll take a time-out while Messier looks at some women's shoes.

107
00:07:08,312 --> 00:07:13,306
Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we first....

108
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:16,411
You know? In fact, she....

109
00:07:17,154 --> 00:07:19,213
She never took them off.

110
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:22,350
It's because we-- Sorry, sorry.

111
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,254
I can't believe--

112
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:28,293
What?

113
00:07:28,293 --> 00:07:29,322
Peach pit.

114
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:32,125
Yes, bunny?

115
00:07:32,336 --> 00:07:36,136
Peach pit. That night, we had--

116
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,236
Peaches?

117
00:07:38,236 --> 00:07:40,232
Actually, nectarines but....

118
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:42,142
Could've been a peach.

119
00:07:42,246 --> 00:07:51,383
Then we-- Then we got dressed and I walked her to the bus stop. I'm fine.

121
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,382
Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's.

122
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:03,094
What? I thought we were trying to find stuff.

123
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:06,234
Come on, you guys. Tell me all the dirt.

124
00:08:06,303 --> 00:08:11,297
Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar.

125
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,361
Let's talk reality for a second.

126
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:16,312
Okay.

127
00:08:16,347 --> 00:08:18,730
When are you coming home?

128
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,113
What? Guys, I'm not.

129
00:08:21,218 --> 00:08:23,169
Come on. This is us.

130
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,120
I'm not.

131
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:29,149
This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job.

132
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,320
I even do my own laundry.

133
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,863
This is what I'm doing now.

134
00:08:37,863 --> 00:08:39,393
Waitressing?

135
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:46,167
I'm not just waitressing. I mean, I'm....

136
00:08:46,243 --> 00:08:52,182
I write the specials on the specials board.

137
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:56,276
And I take the dead flowers out of the vase.

138
00:08:56,353 --> 00:09:01,290
Sometimes Arturo lets me put the chocolate blobbies on the cookies.

139
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:06,092
Well, your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.

140
00:09:16,106 --> 00:09:19,098
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?

141
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:25,239
Okay, how would you like some Tiki Death punch?

142
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:26,732
What's that?

143
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,148
Well, it's rum and--

144
00:09:28,252 --> 00:09:30,152
Okay.

145
00:09:32,122 --> 00:09:35,319
Since Phoebe's staying, we'll have a slumber party.

146
00:09:35,426 --> 00:09:40,159
We got trashy magazines. We got cookie dough. We got Twister.

147
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:46,262
And I brought Operation. But I lost the tweezers so we can't operate.

148
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:49,331
But we can prep the guy.

149
00:09:51,275 --> 00:09:53,726
Rach, it's the Visa card people.

150
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,177
Oh, God. Ask them what they want.

151
00:09:56,247 --> 00:10:00,149
Could you please tell me what this is in reference to?

152
00:10:00,384 --> 00:10:04,252
There's been unusual activity on your account.

153
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:06,380
I haven't used my card in weeks.

154
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,352
That is the unusual activity.

155
00:10:10,394 --> 00:10:13,261
They wanna see if you're okay.

156
00:10:13,297 --> 00:10:17,290
They wanna know if I'm okay? Okay, let's see.

157
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:21,304
Well, let's see. The FICA guys took all my money.

158
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:25,274
Everyone is getting married or pregnant or promoted.

159
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:29,370
And I'm getting coffee. And it's not even for me!

160
00:10:29,413 --> 00:10:34,214
If that sounds like I'm okay, then tell them I'm okay. Okay?

161
00:10:36,186 --> 00:10:41,283
Rachel has left the building. Can you call back?

162
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:44,226
All right! Come on!

163
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:47,296
Let's play Twister!

164
00:10:55,306 --> 00:10:57,774
Sorry.

165
00:10:57,774 --> 00:11:00,242
Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

166
00:11:00,277 --> 00:11:04,236
There was ice that night with Carol? Plastic seats?

167
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:07,273
Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?

168
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:11,380
No, I was just saying we're not sitting together.

169
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:15,454
But now that you mention it, there was ice that night.

170
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,252
It was the first frost.

171
00:11:19,296 --> 00:11:21,389
Sit. Just sit down. Sit.

172
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:25,294
You're doing this amazing independent thing.

173
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:28,166
Monica, what is so amazing?

174
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:32,299
I gave up, like, everything. And for what?

175
00:11:32,376 --> 00:11:34,293
You are just like Jack.

176
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,210
Jack from downstairs?

177
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,415
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.

178
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:42,184
Ah, the other Jack.

179
00:11:42,219 --> 00:11:46,383
Right. He gave up something but then he got those magic beans.

180
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:54,423
And then he woke up and there was this big plant outside of his window, full of possibilities.

182
00:11:55,232 --> 00:11:58,326
He lived in a village, and you live in the Village.

183
00:11:58,402 --> 00:12:05,137
Okay. But, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow. I gave up an orthodontist.

184
00:12:05,242 --> 00:12:07,756
Okay, I know I didn't love him....

185
00:12:07,756 --> 00:12:10,270
Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.

186
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:14,140
But, see, it was a plan. It was clear.

187
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:17,186
Everything was figured out. Now it's like....

188
00:12:17,254 --> 00:12:18,249
Floopy?

189
00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:19,244
Yeah.

190
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:24,157
We don't know where we're going.

191
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:29,291
It's all gonna come together and it's just gonna be un-floopy.

192
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,164
Yeah, like that's a word.

193
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:39,172
Okay. But Monica, what if it doesn't come together?

194
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,404
Pheebs?

195
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:46,372
Well, because you just-- I don't like this question.

196
00:12:47,284 --> 00:12:51,186
See, you guys? What if we don't get magic beans?

197
00:12:51,288 --> 00:12:56,191
I mean, what if all we've got are beans?

198
00:12:59,296 --> 00:13:02,322
Get him! Get him! Get him!

199
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:05,334
Yes! You're not laughing now, are you, pal?

200
00:13:06,136 --> 00:13:10,129
All you needed were guys hitting each other with sticks.

201
00:13:10,174 --> 00:13:12,267
Pass it! Pass it!

202
00:13:12,342 --> 00:13:14,793
He's open! He's open!

203
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:17,244
Shoot it! Shoot it!

204
00:13:22,252 --> 00:13:25,153
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing.

205
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,292
Excuse me?

206
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:42,168
It says to call if you're not satisfied with this candy bar.

207
00:13:42,206 --> 00:13:45,266
Well, I'm not completely satisfied.

208
00:13:47,211 --> 00:13:50,203
Well, the label promises nutty goodness.

209
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:55,413
It's an emergency. But you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.

210
00:13:58,222 --> 00:14:01,214
Hold on. Fill these out. Sit over there!

211
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:05,318
I don't want to make any trouble but I'm in a lot of pain.

212
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,795
My face is dented.

213
00:14:07,795 --> 00:14:10,161
Well, you'll have to wait your turn.

214
00:14:10,234 --> 00:14:12,731
How long do you think it will be?

215
00:14:12,731 --> 00:14:15,228
Any minute now.

216
00:14:17,341 --> 00:14:19,332
Hey, this--

217
00:14:31,355 --> 00:14:36,156
I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.

218
00:14:36,193 --> 00:14:41,290
No, you were right. I don't have a plan.

219
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:45,267
Pizza guy.

220
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:47,167
Food!

221
00:14:47,204 --> 00:14:48,233
Phoebe?

222
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:49,262
What?

223
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,336
Do you have a plan?

224
00:14:51,336 --> 00:14:53,366
I don't even have a ''pla.''

225
00:14:56,213 --> 00:14:58,374
One mushroom, green pepper and onion?

226
00:14:59,183 --> 00:15:02,311
No, no, no. That's not what we ordered!

227
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,419
We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese!

228
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:14,127
Wait. You're not G. Stephanopoulos? Man, my dad's gonna kill me!

229
00:15:14,231 --> 00:15:18,258
Wait! Did you say G. Stephanopoulos?

230
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:23,329
Yeah, this one goes across the street. I gave him yours. Bonehead! Bonehead!

231
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:27,338
When you do that, you're only hitting yourself.

232
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:35,340
Was this a small Mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?

233
00:15:35,385 --> 00:15:37,381
That sounds right.

234
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:39,377
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?

235
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,822
And a power tie?

236
00:15:41,822 --> 00:15:43,454
No, pretty much just a towel.

237
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,190
Oh, God!

238
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,186
You guys want me to take this back?

239
00:15:48,298 --> 00:15:53,201
What, are you nuts? We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!

240
00:15:56,406 --> 00:16:01,207
Pheebs, who's George Snuffleupagus?

241
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:05,307
That's Big Bird's friend.

242
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:08,798
I see pizza!

243
00:16:08,798 --> 00:16:10,345
I want to see. Let me see.

244
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:13,112
Hello! Who are we spying on?

245
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:16,215
White House adviser, Clinton's campaign guy.

246
00:16:16,326 --> 00:16:20,126
The one with the great hair, sexy smile, cute butt.

247
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,166
Oh, him! The little guy. Oh, I love him!

248
00:16:24,268 --> 00:16:26,850
Wait. Wait, I see a woman.

249
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,432
Tell me it's his mother.

250
00:16:30,173 --> 00:16:31,270
Definitely not his mother.

251
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,367
Oh, no!

252
00:16:33,143 --> 00:16:37,341
Wait, she's walking across the floor. She's walking, she's walking....

253
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:41,340
She's going for the pizza-- That's not for you, bitch!

254
00:16:56,366 --> 00:17:01,235
We've been here for over an hour, and people less sick have gone in.

255
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:05,206
That guy with the toe thing, who's he sleeping with?

256
00:17:08,145 --> 00:17:11,114
Oh, come on, Dora. Don't be mad.

257
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:19,316
I know we both said some things...we didn't mean but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.

259
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:23,251
You know, I feel like I've lost her.

260
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,125
Come on, push me.

261
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,120
No.

262
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:30,279
Push me.

263
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,359
We're gonna get in trouble.

264
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,228
Don't be a baby. Push me. Push me.

265
00:17:34,338 --> 00:17:40,140
All right. I'm gonna push you, okay? How about I push you like this?

266
00:17:41,378 --> 00:17:47,339
Now you're gonna be in a wheelchair the rest of your life, pally-wally....

267
00:17:49,286 --> 00:17:55,156
I am so very sorry. Can I sign you?

268
00:17:57,294 --> 00:17:58,278
Lights still out?

269
00:17:58,278 --> 00:17:59,262
Yeah.

270
00:17:59,363 --> 00:18:02,230
Well, maybe they're napping.

271
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:04,716
Please. They're having sex.

272
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:07,133
Shut up!

273
00:18:10,107 --> 00:18:14,305
So, what do you think George is like?

274
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:15,743
I think he's shy.

275
00:18:15,743 --> 00:18:17,142
Yeah.

276
00:18:17,214 --> 00:18:20,206
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out.

277
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:25,244
And then when you do, he's a preppy animal.

278
00:18:26,256 --> 00:18:27,740
What do you think of the guys?

279
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,224
Our guys?

280
00:18:29,326 --> 00:18:31,226
Yeah, our guys.

281
00:18:31,226 --> 00:18:33,126
I feel funny talking about that.

282
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,743
Oh, come on.

283
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:36,256
Okay. Well....

284
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,234
I think Joey's like a little kiddie ride.

285
00:18:39,336 --> 00:18:43,432
You just have to put the quarter in and it just goes.

286
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:52,247
He might surprise you. One time, he helped me put on my coat and he was really tender.

288
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:57,150
Come on, baby, come on. Let's go.

289
00:18:57,254 --> 00:18:59,188
Yes!

290
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:05,093
Chandler's one of those repressed guys who you'd have to seduce.

291
00:19:05,128 --> 00:19:10,088
I think it's an act. Chandler is more sophisticated than he seems.

292
00:19:15,205 --> 00:19:16,302
You know who's kind of sexy?

293
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:17,399
Don't.

294
00:19:18,141 --> 00:19:19,722
Ross.

295
00:19:19,722 --> 00:19:21,303
No, guys. Please, he is my brother.

296
00:19:21,344 --> 00:19:25,246
I know exactly what you mean. He can be really smooth.

297
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,260
Can't you just picture him in bed?

298
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:41,422
I really don't want to.

299
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:45,167
Come on, laugh. Laugh.

300
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:52,271
I remember the moonlight coming in the window, and her face had the most incredible glow.

302
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:56,334
The moon, the glow, the magical feeling. You did this.

303
00:19:57,147 --> 00:20:00,241
Could I get some painkillers over here, please?

304
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:04,286
He's right. Enough. What's the big deal about today?

305
00:20:04,354 --> 00:20:07,289
So you slept with her for the first time.

306
00:20:07,357 --> 00:20:10,383
You slept with her for seven years after that.

307
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,387
It's a little more complicated--

308
00:20:14,197 --> 00:20:18,395
What is it, that she left you for another woman that likes women?

309
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:24,300
Louder. There's a man on the 1 2th floor in a coma who didn't hear you.

310
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:28,201
Then, what?

311
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:34,376
My first time with Carol was was my....

313
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:36,409
What?

314
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:44,283
It was my first time.

315
00:20:44,427 --> 00:20:46,395
With Carol?

316
00:20:51,301 --> 00:20:52,393
Oh.

317
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:57,204
So, in your whole life, you've only been with one--?

318
00:20:58,408 --> 00:21:02,276
Oh, boy. Hockey was a big mistake.

319
00:21:03,146 --> 00:21:06,274
There's a bunch of stuff we could've done tonight.

320
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:10,244
Okay, I got one.

321
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:17,149
Do you remember that vegetarian pâté that I made that you loved so much?

323
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:21,392
Well, unless goose is a vegetable--!

324
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:28,394
Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.

325
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,185
What? You slept with Jason?

326
00:21:31,185 --> 00:21:33,164
You had already broken up.

327
00:21:33,276 --> 00:21:34,322
How long?

328
00:21:34,322 --> 00:21:35,368
Just a couple hours.

329
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:38,278
Oh, that's nice!

330
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:40,377
Okay, okay, okay, I got one!

331
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:47,379
Anyway, the valentine Tom left in your locker was really from me!

332
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,225
Excuse me?

333
00:21:50,293 --> 00:21:54,423
Hello! Like he was really gonna send you one.

334
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:59,293
She was a big girl!

335
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:06,166
Really? Well, at least big girls don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!

336
00:22:06,276 --> 00:22:09,245
I was laughing. You made me laugh!

337
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,146
Oh, my God! There he is! There he is!

338
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:13,796
Where?

339
00:22:13,796 --> 00:22:15,343
Where we've been looking all night.

340
00:22:16,152 --> 00:22:17,648
He's so cute.

341
00:22:17,648 --> 00:22:19,144
George, baby, drop the towel.

342
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:21,304
Come on, drop the towel.

343
00:22:21,304 --> 00:22:23,352
Drop it. Will you please drop it?

344
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,156
Wow!

345
00:22:28,398 --> 00:22:33,392
Man, can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?

346
00:22:34,371 --> 00:22:38,364
I think it's great. You know, it's sweet.

347
00:22:38,475 --> 00:22:40,466
It's romantic.

348
00:22:41,378 --> 00:22:42,402
Really?

349
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:46,273
You kidding? The guy's a freak. I judge him.

350
00:22:46,316 --> 00:22:47,300
Hey, man!

351
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,284
Hey, buddy!

352
00:22:52,222 --> 00:22:56,215
Oh, that's attractive.

353
00:22:57,327 --> 00:23:01,127
I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs.

354
00:23:02,365 --> 00:23:06,233
Admit it, all things considered, you had fun tonight.

355
00:23:06,336 --> 00:23:10,170
Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me which part was fun.

356
00:23:10,273 --> 00:23:11,365
Where's my puck?

357
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:13,638
The kid has it.

358
00:23:13,638 --> 00:23:15,134
The kid--

359
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:18,341
Excuse me, that's my puck.

360
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:23,245
I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.

361
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:27,453
You gotta do it, man.

362
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:31,393
I'm rubber, you're glue. Whatever you--

363
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:33,390
I can't do it.

364
00:23:34,197 --> 00:23:35,294
Listen, give me back my puck.

365
00:23:35,294 --> 00:23:36,391
No.

366
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:37,764
Yes, how about--?

367
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:38,361
No.

368
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:39,385
Give me my puck.

369
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:40,369
No.

370
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:42,371
No roughhousing in my ER!

371
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:45,300
Give me my puck!

372
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,375
Now that was fun.

373
00:23:58,221 --> 00:24:02,317
Okay, Monica. Right foot, red.

374
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:06,318
We could've played Monopoly, but no!

375
00:24:12,268 --> 00:24:14,168
Thanks.

376
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:24,177
Okay, Pheebs. Right hand, blue.

377
00:24:31,187 --> 00:24:35,180
Ross, switch with me and Phoebe could be number two.

378
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:41,353
Nothing. It's a Twister thing. The rules are on the back of the box.

379
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,394
Hello?

380
00:24:46,202 --> 00:24:48,170
It's the Visa card people.

381
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:50,239
Okay. Will you take my place?

382
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,207
All right. This is Rachel.

383
00:24:52,308 --> 00:24:54,208
No!

384
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:01,307
Hello? Oh, yeah. No, I know. I haven't been using it much.

385
00:25:01,351 --> 00:25:05,117
Oh, well, thanks. But I'm okay, really.

386
00:25:05,221 --> 00:25:06,267
To the green.

387
00:25:06,267 --> 00:25:07,313
Oh, no.

388
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:10,325
I've got magic beans.

389
00:25:12,362 --> 00:25:14,262
No, no, never mind.

390
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,231
To the left! To the left!

391
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:20,325
I'm fine.
