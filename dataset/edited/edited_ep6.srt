1
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:08,332
Oh, look! There's Joey's picture!

2
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,467
This is so exciting!

3
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:13,235
You can spot someone who's never seen his plays.

4
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:16,440
Notice, no fear. No sense of impending doom.

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:22,444
''The role of man number three will not be played by Vic Shapiro.''

6
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,287
We came on the wrong night.

7
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:29,257
I can't believe I forgot a magazine.

8
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:30,791
Come on, this might be good.

9
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,287
I don't know.

10
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:37,302
The exclamation point scares me. It's not just Freud, it's Freud!

11
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,373
Magic is about to happen!

12
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:46,468
Well, Eva we've done some excellent work here.

14
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:54,285
And I would have to say your problem is quite clear.

16
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:59,288
All you want is a dinkle

17
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:02,327
What you envy's a schwang

18
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:05,525
A thing through which you can tinkle

19
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,427
To play with or simply let hang

20
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,344
I feel violated.

21
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:32,247
Did anybody else feel like peeling their skin off to have something else to do?

23
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,341
Ross, 10:00.

24
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,286
Is it? It feels like 2.

25
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,373
No, 10:00!

26
00:02:38,373 --> 00:02:40,290
What?

27
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,456
There's a beautiful woman at 8, 9, 10:00!

28
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,458
Hello!

29
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,405
She's amazing! She makes the women I dream about look like fat, bald men.

30
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:55,464
Go over. She's not with anyone.

31
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:59,308
And what would my opening line be? Excuse me....

32
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:04,245
Come on, she's a person. You can do it.

33
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,319
Could she be more out of my league? Back me up.

34
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,220
He couldn't get a woman like that in a million years.

35
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:16,327
You always see these beautiful women with ''nothing'' guys.

36
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:19,262
You could be one of those guys.

37
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,360
You could do that.

38
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,355
You think?

39
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,231
Absolutely!

40
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,361
I can't believe I'm considering this.

41
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:26,904
I'm very aware of my tongue.

42
00:03:26,904 --> 00:03:28,337
Come on.

43
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,341
Here goes.

44
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:33,435
Stand back, everyone. Incoming ego shrapnel.

45
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,340
All right, I can do this.

46
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:41,299
Yes?

47
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:42,345
Hi.

48
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:47,259
Okay, next word would be Chandler.

50
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,556
Chandler is my name and....

51
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,297
Hi!

52
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,265
Yes, you said that.

53
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:59,294
Yes! Yes, I did. But what I didn't say....

54
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:05,309
What I wanted to say was would you like to go out with me? Thank you. Good night.

56
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,435
Chandler?

57
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,863
I didn't know you could dance!

58
00:04:11,863 --> 00:04:13,410
You were in a play!

59
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,421
What'd you think?

60
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,786
I didn't know you could dance!

61
00:04:17,786 --> 00:04:19,316
You were in a play!

62
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,258
It wasn't that bad. I was the lead.

63
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:26,424
It was better than the troll thing. At least you got to see my head.

64
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,848
You're right.

65
00:04:27,848 --> 00:04:29,230
We saw your head.

66
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,369
How about that accent?

67
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:36,374
Yeah. All of your W's were V's.

68
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,336
She said yes!

69
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,439
Awful play, man!

70
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:49,347
Her name's Aurora. She's Italian and she pronounces my name ''Chandler.''

71
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,449
I like that better.

72
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,458
The usher gave me this.

73
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,757
What is it?

74
00:04:56,757 --> 00:04:58,253
The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency.

75
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:01,197
An agency left its card. They wanna sign me!

76
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,394
Based on this play?

77
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,496
Based on this play!

78
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,299
Look! There's a note on the back.

79
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:13,210
''Loved your work. Call me a sap.''

80
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,307
She was obviously very moved!

81
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,250
You should call her fairly quickly.

82
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,447
Yeah! As soon as possible!

83
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,419
Come in!

84
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,328
Hi. I'm here to see Estelle Leonard.

85
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,527
Just a moment, let me see if she's in.

86
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,435
Hello.

87
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,306
You're Estelle?

88
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:45,471
I know you weren't expecting someone so fantastically beautiful.

90
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:53,275
Love lump. Take a load off already, darling. Sit already.

91
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,445
I can't tell you how excited I am to be here.

92
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,484
Why not?

93
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,256
What I meant was--

94
00:06:02,256 --> 00:06:04,286
You don't mind if I eat, do you?

95
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:13,429
Joey sweetheart, let me ask you a question.

97
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,403
Did you ever see the movie Sleepless in Seattle?

98
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,758
Wow! Do you represent those actors?

99
00:06:19,758 --> 00:06:21,305
No.

100
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:25,247
But you know the end, where they're happy?

101
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:28,219
That's gonna be you and me.

102
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,450
You mean you wanna sign me?

103
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:36,321
No, I wanna go to the top of the Empire State Building and make out.

104
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,321
Of course I wanna sign you!

105
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,312
Miss Leonard, I'm so--

106
00:06:41,312 --> 00:06:42,358
Oh, boy.

107
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,902
Ride them, cowboy.

108
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:45,369
I'm sorry!

109
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,474
I don't see it!

110
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,799
Try to look through it.

111
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:03,312
Unfocus your eyes.

112
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,290
Focus? There's nothing to focus on.

113
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,757
It's the Statue of Liberty!

114
00:07:08,757 --> 00:07:10,321
Right!

115
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:11,863
Where's the Statue of Liberty?

116
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:13,330
There.

117
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,333
I can't not see it now.

118
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,325
Hey, kids!

119
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,236
Come here. Do you see anything here?

120
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,854
It looks like a boat.

121
00:07:22,854 --> 00:07:24,401
A boat.

122
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,441
Right in front of the Statue of Liberty.

123
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:34,250
It's been seven seconds, and you haven't asked me how my date went.

124
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,413
How was your date, Chandler?

125
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,253
It was unbelievable!

126
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:42,226
I've never met anyone like her. She's had an amazing life!

127
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,229
She was in the Israeli army.

128
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,426
None of the bullets hit the engine, so we made it to the border.

129
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,362
But just barely, and I....

130
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,464
I've been talking about myself all night long. I'm sorry.

131
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,267
What about you? Tell me a story.

132
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:03,214
All right, once I got on the subway.

134
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:08,310
And it was at night and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn.

136
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:11,185
Just for the hell of it.

137
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,225
We talked until 2:00. It was perfect.

138
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,217
More or less.

139
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,422
Suddenly, we realized we were in Yemen.

140
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,424
I'm sorry, so ''we'' is...?

141
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,197
''We'' is me and Rick.

142
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,225
Who's Rick?

143
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,395
Who's Rick?

144
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:27,501
My husband.

145
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:31,922
Oh, so you're divorced?

146
00:08:31,922 --> 00:08:33,435
No.

147
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:38,240
I'm sorry. So you're widowed? Hopefully?

148
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,444
No, I'm still married.

149
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:51,422
So, how would your husband feel about you sitting here with me sliding your foot so far up my leg you can count the change in my pocket?

151
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,262
Don't worry.

152
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:58,235
He'd be okay with you because he's okay with Ethan.

153
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,263
Ethan? There's an Ethan?

154
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,402
Ethan is my boyfriend.

155
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,270
What?

156
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:15,420
What kind of relationship do you imagine us having if you have a husband and a boyfriend?

158
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:19,214
I suppose, mainly sexual.

159
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,388
Sorry it didn't work out.

160
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:27,290
What, not work out? I'm seeing her again on Thursday.

161
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,200
Didn't you listen to the story?

162
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,431
Didn't you listen? It's twisted!

163
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,231
How could you get involved with her?

164
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:40,301
I had trouble with it at first. But I get the good stuff.

165
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:46,351
All the fun, all the talking, all the sex and none of the responsibility.

167
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,732
This is every guy's fantasy!

168
00:09:48,732 --> 00:09:50,245
That's not true!

169
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,274
Ross, is this your fantasy?

170
00:09:52,274 --> 00:09:54,225
No, of course not.

171
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,429
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

172
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:02,232
You'd go out with someone going out with someone else?

173
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,363
I couldn't.

174
00:10:03,363 --> 00:10:04,358
Good for you.

175
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:10,365
When I'm with a woman, I need to know I'm going out with more people than her.

177
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:14,337
Once, I went out with a guy who just got divorced.

178
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,541
It was hard. His kids liked me better than him.

179
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,479
What does this have to do with Chandler?

180
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,388
Nothing.

181
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:26,390
I didn't have anything on that topic.

182
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,484
So I went another way.

183
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:33,454
You know, monogamy can be a tricky concept.

184
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,496
I mean, anthropologically speaking--

185
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,362
Fine. Now you'll never know.

186
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,304
We're kidding. Tell us.

187
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,340
We wanna know.

188
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,272
Come on!

189
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:48,279
All right. There's a theory put forth by Richard Leakey--

190
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,317
Are we greeting each other this way now? I like it.

191
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,424
Look! I cleaned!

192
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,262
I did the windows. I did the floors.

193
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:13,328
I used all the vacuum attachments but the round one. What's it for?

194
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,431
Nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.

195
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,232
What do you think?

196
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,891
It's very clean.

197
00:11:19,891 --> 00:11:21,438
Really, it looks great!

198
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,284
I see you moved the green ottoman.

199
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,384
How did that happen?

200
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,388
I don't know. It looked better there.

201
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,299
And it's an extra seat around the table.

202
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,367
Yeah, it's interesting.

203
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:51,307
But you know what? Just for fun let's see what it looked like in the old spot.

205
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,472
Just to compare.

206
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,308
Let's see.

207
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,415
Well, it looks good there too.

208
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,245
Let's leave it there for a while.

209
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,314
I can't believe you moved the green ottoman.

210
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:09,354
Be glad you didn't fan the magazines. She'll scratch your eyes out.

211
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,941
You guys, I am not that bad!

212
00:12:10,941 --> 00:12:12,454
Yeah, you are.

213
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,461
Remember, I lived with you? You were a little....

214
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,333
That is so unfair!

215
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:28,369
When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy.

216
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,444
Okay, so I'm responsible. I'm organized.

217
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,476
But hey, I can be a kook!

218
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,280
All right, you madcap gal!

219
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,249
Imagine this.

220
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:46,297
The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.

221
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:47,831
Why not?

222
00:12:47,831 --> 00:12:49,264
Because you're a kook!

223
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,498
You wait until they send a notice.

224
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,270
I could do that.

225
00:12:56,308 --> 00:13:00,244
Okay, then you let me go grocery shopping--

226
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,876
No problem.

227
00:13:01,876 --> 00:13:03,406
I'm not done yet.

228
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:09,244
And I buy detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.

229
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,516
Why would someone do that?

230
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,352
One might wonder.

231
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,422
But I would be fine with that.

232
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:24,368
A glass is on the table with no coaster. A cold drink. A hot day.

233
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:29,364
Beads of condensation are inching closer to the wood....

234
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,464
Stop it!

235
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,470
Oh, my God!

236
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,282
It's true. Who am I?

237
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,452
Monica, you're Mom.

238
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,284
Oh, my God!

239
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,466
Okay, I'll be there.

240
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,395
That was my agent.

241
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:06,300
My agent has just gotten me a job in the new AI Pacino movie!

242
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,862
That's great!

243
00:14:07,862 --> 00:14:09,312
What's the part?

244
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:13,408
Can you believe it? Pacino! This guy's why I became an actor!

245
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,419
''Out of order? You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!''

246
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,226
Seriously, what's the part?

247
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:26,230
''Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!''

248
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:29,324
Come on. Seriously, Joey, what's the part?

249
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,463
You're.... What?

250
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,434
I'm his butt double, okay?

251
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,475
I play AI Pacino's butt.

252
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:52,447
All right? He goes into the shower, and then I'm his butt.

254
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,283
Oh, my God!

255
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,451
Come on, you guys.

256
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:59,294
It's a real Pacino movie and that's big!

257
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,198
It's terrific. You deserve this.

258
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:07,194
After years of struggling you've cracked your way into show business.

259
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,239
Fine. Make jokes, I don't care.

260
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,875
This is a big break for me!

261
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,439
You're right. It is.

262
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,208
So, will you invite us to the big opening?

263
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:30,945
I need some moisturizer.

264
00:15:30,945 --> 00:15:32,429
For what?

265
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,223
Today's the big day!

266
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,462
You got any tweezers? I think I have a rogue hair.

267
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,375
God. Go in the bathroom. Use whatever you want.

268
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,378
Don't ever tell me what you did in there.

269
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,346
Thank you.

270
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,767
Joey's mom's on the phone.

271
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:54,251
In the bathroom.

272
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,867
You don't wanna go in there!

273
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:57,448
Come on, we're roommates.

274
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,317
My eyes! My eyes!

275
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,389
I warned you.

276
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,392
Who is being loud?

277
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,401
Oh, that would be Monica.

278
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,328
Can I borrow stuff? I wanna make Aurora breakfast.

279
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,339
You got the whole night?

280
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:18,410
Well, I only have 20 minutes until Ethan, so....

281
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,439
Do I sense resentment?

282
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:26,341
No. No resentment. Believe me it's worth it, okay?

284
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:31,355
In a relationship, you have moments you'll remember the rest of your life.

285
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:35,223
Every single second is like that with Aurora.

286
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,522
I've just wasted 35 of them talking to you.

287
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:41,323
So, Monica, can you help me with the door?

288
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:49,330
The old Monica would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush.

290
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,469
But I'm not gonna do that.

291
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:03,415
Excuse me? Can they warm it up? I'm concerned about goose bumps.

292
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,213
Everybody ready?

293
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,384
I wanna thank you for this opportunity.

294
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:15,196
I mean, I know this is just a first step, but I hope that someday--

295
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,256
Lose the robe.

296
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:20,270
Right. Okay. Losing the robe!

297
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,231
Okay, and the robe is lost.

298
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:26,411
I would like to get this in one take.

299
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,242
Let's roll it.

300
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,304
Water's working.

301
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,283
And action!

302
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,218
And cut!

303
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:39,289
Butt guy, what are you doing?

304
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,222
I'm showering.

305
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,351
No, that was clenching.

306
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,331
The way I see it, the guy's upset here, you know?

307
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:50,231
His wife's dead, his brother's missing.

308
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,238
I think his butt would be angry here.

309
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:57,307
I think his butt would like to get the shot before lunch.

310
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,277
Once again, rolling. Water working.

311
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,248
And action!

312
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,216
And cut! What was that?

313
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,381
I was going for quiet desperation.

314
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,283
But if you have to ask....

315
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,334
God, I love these fingers.

316
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,493
Thank you.

317
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:28,297
No, actually, I meant my fingers.

318
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,432
Look at them. Look at how happy they are.

319
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,779
Oh, my God, I'm late!

320
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:36,246
Oh, no!

321
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,832
Don't go.

322
00:18:37,832 --> 00:18:39,316
Okay.

323
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,331
I have to.

324
00:18:41,331 --> 00:18:42,343
Look, she's leaving.

325
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,416
I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.

326
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,408
I thought you talked to Rick.

327
00:18:47,408 --> 00:18:49,359
It's not Rick.

328
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,259
Ethan? He gets the whole day!

329
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,232
No, it's Andrew.

330
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:05,174
I know there'll be moments when I'll regret asking the following question, but....

332
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,843
And Andrew is?

333
00:19:06,843 --> 00:19:10,280
He's new.

335
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:15,284
So you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?

336
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,187
No, that's not exactly what I was--

337
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:22,284
Most women would kill for three guys like us.

339
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,908
So, what do you want?

340
00:19:24,908 --> 00:19:26,421
You.

341
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,296
You have me.

342
00:19:28,296 --> 00:19:29,393
No. Just you.

343
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,816
What do you mean?

344
00:19:31,816 --> 00:19:33,397
Lose the other guys.

345
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:37,298
Like, all of them?

346
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:40,411
Come on, we're great together. Why not?

347
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,204
Can't we have what we have now?

348
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:48,419
Why can't we talk and make love without feeling obligated to each other?

350
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:53,214
Up until tonight, I thought that's what you wanted too.

351
00:19:53,425 --> 00:20:02,322
Well, part of me wants that but it's like I'm two guys. One guy's saying, ''This is great!''

353
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,335
But there's this other guy.

354
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:10,433
The guy who wells up when the Grinch's heart grows and breaks that measuring device.

356
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:15,543
He's saying, you know, ''This is too hard. Get out!''

357
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:19,273
So, which one of the guys will you listen to?

358
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:25,246
I have to listen to both. They don't let each other finish.

359
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,483
Which one?

360
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,489
The second guy.

361
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,266
I see.

362
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:42,263
Call me if you change your mind.

363
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:54,275
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.

364
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:09,266
Look at it this way. You dumped her!

365
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:19,240
Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable.

367
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,440
Tell me why you did this again?

368
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,280
Movie star!

369
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:31,345
Wait! Aren't you the guy who plays the butt in the new Pacino movie?

370
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,349
Nope.

371
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:36,293
No? What happened, big guy?

372
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,363
Big guy?

373
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,456
It felt like a ''big guy'' moment.

374
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,302
I got fired!

375
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:48,464
They said I acted too much with it.

376
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,266
I told everybody about this!

377
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:53,827
Everybody's expecting to see me.

378
00:21:53,827 --> 00:21:55,277
Know what?

379
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,978
No one will be able to tell.

380
00:21:56,978 --> 00:21:58,576
My mom will.

381
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:04,512
There's something so sweet and disturbing about that.

382
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:12,456
I've done crappy plays for six years and I finally get my shot, and I blow it!

384
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:14,459
Maybe this wasn't it.

385
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:19,465
I think when it's your shot, you know it's your shot.

386
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:23,241
Did it feel like your shot?

387
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,437
Hard to tell. I was naked.

388
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:30,471
I don't think this was it. I don't think you just get one.

389
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:34,377
I believe things are gonna happen for you. I do.

390
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:38,446
You've got to think about the day some kid will go:

391
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:43,450
''I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!''

392
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:48,489
You think? That's so nice.

393
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:57,398
I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.

394
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:58,522
Good night.

395
00:22:58,522 --> 00:22:59,568
Good night.

396
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,406
You're gonna leave your shoes out here?

397
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:13,323
Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless, haphazard manner?

399
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:18,327
It doesn't matter. I'll get them tomorrow. Or not!

400
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,424
Whenever.

401
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:26,429
She is a kook.

402
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:43,252
If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes.

403
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,451
No, don't do this!

404
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,356
This is stupid!

405
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:52,295
I don't have to prove anything. I'm gonna get them.

406
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:55,366
But then everyone will know.

407
00:23:55,467 --> 00:24:00,234
Unless I get them, then wake up really early and put them back.

408
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,398
I need help!

409
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,240
-All you want is a dinkle

410
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,236
Not that song!

411
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,311
-All you envy's a schwang

412
00:24:12,311 --> 00:24:14,307
Come on, you guys.

413
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:18,321
A thing through which you can tinkle

414
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:21,348
Or play with or simply let hang

415
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:26,329
All you want is a dinkle

416
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:29,457
What you envy's a schwang

417
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:33,431
A thing through which you can tinkle

418
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:38,341
Or play with or simply let hang
