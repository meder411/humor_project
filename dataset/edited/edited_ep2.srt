1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,456
You don't understand.

2
00:00:04,232 --> 00:00:07,224
For us, kissing is as important as any part.

3
00:00:07,335 --> 00:00:08,427
Yeah, right!

4
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:12,431
You serious?

5
00:00:13,441 --> 00:00:14,373
Oh, yeah.

6
00:00:14,476 --> 00:00:16,376
Everything is in that first kiss.

7
00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:18,276
Absolutely.

8
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:26,377
For us, kissing's an opening act like the comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.

11
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:33,257
And it's not that we don't like the comedian.

12
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:38,355
It's just that that's not why we bought the ticket.

13
00:00:40,368 --> 00:00:48,306
The problem is, no matter how great the show was you girls are looking for the comedian again.

15
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:53,370
We're in the car, fighting traffic, just trying to stay awake.

16
00:00:55,383 --> 00:00:58,318
Word of advice: Bring back the comedian.

17
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,255
Or next time you'll find yourself listening to that album alone.

18
00:01:07,462 --> 00:01:10,329
Are we still talking about sex?

19
00:02:01,449 --> 00:02:03,417
No, it's good. It is good.

20
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:07,347
It's just that-- Doesn't she seem a little angry?

21
00:02:07,455 --> 00:02:09,218
Well, she has issues.

22
00:02:11,226 --> 00:02:12,215
Does she?

23
00:02:12,327 --> 00:02:14,420
Try to live with ''Mr. I'm Evolving.''

24
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:22,227
He's out while she's home getting the mastodon smell out of the carpet.

25
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,430
Marsha, see, these are cave people.

26
00:02:26,441 --> 00:02:28,466
Okay, they have issues like:

27
00:02:29,344 --> 00:02:32,438
''Gee, that glacier's getting kind of close.''

28
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,280
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?

29
00:02:36,351 --> 00:02:37,318
No.

30
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:38,285
Yes, it is. Carol, hi!

31
00:02:38,386 --> 00:02:42,379
Okay. Yes, it is. I'll catch up with you in the Ice Age.

32
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,440
Can I stay?

33
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,390
No.

34
00:02:59,307 --> 00:02:59,870
Hi.

35
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,433
Hi.

36
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,866
Is this a bad time?

37
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:13,444
No, it's the Stone Age.

39
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:19,455
You look great. I hate that.

40
00:03:20,428 --> 00:03:24,228
Sorry. Thanks. You look good too.

41
00:03:24,332 --> 00:03:30,233
Well, you know, in here, anyone who...stands erect....

43
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:34,837
What's new? Still a--

44
00:03:34,837 --> 00:03:36,333
A lesbian?

45
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:41,476
You never know. How's the family?

46
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,847
Marty's still totally paranoid.

47
00:03:44,847 --> 00:03:47,344
Carol, why are you here?

48
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,387
I'm pregnant.

49
00:03:50,387 --> 00:03:51,484
Pregnant.

50
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,200
She didn't leave in such a hurry after all.

51
00:04:03,238 --> 00:04:07,436
This is the Three's Company episode with a misunderstanding.

52
00:04:10,411 --> 00:04:13,346
Then I've already seen this one.

53
00:04:14,415 --> 00:04:16,315
Are you through with that?

54
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:19,318
Sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.

55
00:04:20,421 --> 00:04:22,355
Whose ball of paper is this?

56
00:04:22,423 --> 00:04:26,416
Mine. I wrote a note to myself, then I didn't need it.

57
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:29,453
So I balled it up and now I wish I was dead.

58
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:36,326
She already fluffed that pillow. You already fluffed-- It's fine.

59
00:04:37,238 --> 00:04:40,435
I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition.

60
00:04:40,475 --> 00:04:44,468
Parents can be cruel about the flatness of a child's pillow.

61
00:04:46,447 --> 00:04:50,247
Relax, you do this every time. The place looks great.

62
00:04:50,285 --> 00:04:55,388
You got a lasagna here that looks good enough to avoid touching.

64
00:04:58,493 --> 00:05:00,222
Monica? Hi!

65
00:05:02,196 --> 00:05:04,323
Monica, you're scaring me.

66
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,300
I mean, you're all chaotic and twirly, you know?

67
00:05:09,404 --> 00:05:10,428
Not in a good way.

68
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:18,345
Calm down. You don't see Ross getting twirly every time they come.

69
00:05:18,446 --> 00:05:22,348
That's because my parents think Ross can do no wrong.

70
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:24,408
You see, he's ''The Prince.''

71
00:05:24,452 --> 00:05:28,320
They had some big ceremony before I was born.

72
00:05:32,226 --> 00:05:33,323
What?

73
00:05:33,323 --> 00:05:34,420
Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.

74
00:05:39,434 --> 00:05:41,334
Has anybody seen my engagement ring?

75
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:43,234
It's beautiful.

76
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:51,268
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

77
00:05:51,346 --> 00:05:53,280
No, don't touch that.

78
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:00,183
Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back.

79
00:06:00,221 --> 00:06:05,284
''Hi, Barry, remember me? I'm the girl that stomped on your heart.''

80
00:06:05,393 --> 00:06:12,189
Now I must return the ring without the ring which makes it so much harder.

82
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:14,424
Easy, we'll find it. Won't we?

83
00:06:16,204 --> 00:06:21,236
Look, it's gonna be okay. You'll give it back and we'll eat ice cream.

85
00:06:21,236 --> 00:06:23,232
Okay. It's a pear-shaped diamond--

86
00:06:23,344 --> 00:06:26,336
Any diamond ring we find, we'll run it by you.

87
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:30,428
When did you have it last?

88
00:06:30,428 --> 00:06:32,407
Doy, right before she lost it.

89
00:06:35,256 --> 00:06:37,451
You don't get a lot of ''doy'' these days.

90
00:06:39,427 --> 00:06:42,225
I know I had it this morning.

91
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,322
I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with--

92
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:47,230
Dinah?

93
00:06:50,238 --> 00:06:51,785
Oh, don't be mad.

94
00:06:51,785 --> 00:06:53,332
You didn't.

95
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:55,454
Oh, I'm sorry.

96
00:06:55,454 --> 00:06:57,467
I gave you one job!

97
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,407
But look how straight those noodles are.

98
00:07:02,383 --> 00:07:07,286
That's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagna.

99
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,221
I just can't do it.

100
00:07:12,326 --> 00:07:16,194
Boys? We're going in.

101
00:07:24,338 --> 00:07:25,327
Hi.

102
00:07:27,341 --> 00:07:28,888
That is not a happy ''hi.''

103
00:07:28,888 --> 00:07:30,435
Carol's pregnant.

104
00:07:31,212 --> 00:07:32,304
I found it!

105
00:07:34,415 --> 00:07:37,441
What--?

106
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,343
Yeah.

107
00:07:40,354 --> 00:07:45,257
Do that for two hours, you might be where I am about now.

108
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,320
That puts that whole pillow thing in perspective.

109
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:54,265
How do you fit into this whole thing?

110
00:07:54,368 --> 00:07:57,235
Carol and Susan want me to be involved.

111
00:07:57,338 --> 00:08:02,173
But if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.

112
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:04,258
It's totally up to me.

113
00:08:04,258 --> 00:08:06,306
She is so great. I miss her.

114
00:08:11,385 --> 00:08:13,433
What does she mean by ''involved''?

115
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:15,481
Your job is done.

116
00:08:18,192 --> 00:08:19,420
And the most enjoyable.

117
00:08:21,395 --> 00:08:23,386
Phoebe, say something.

118
00:08:23,498 --> 00:08:29,200
They want me to go down to this sonogram thing with them tomorrow.

120
00:08:29,303 --> 00:08:34,203
Remember when life was simpler and she was just a lesbian?

122
00:08:35,243 --> 00:08:37,336
Those were the days.

123
00:08:38,212 --> 00:08:39,810
What are you gonna do?

124
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,408
I have no idea.

125
00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:45,408
No matter what I do, I'm still gonna be a father.

126
00:08:55,429 --> 00:08:57,454
This is still ruined, right?

127
00:09:03,348 --> 00:09:07,182
Martha Lugwin's daughter is gonna call you.

128
00:09:09,454 --> 00:09:11,371
What's that curry taste?

129
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:13,288
Curry.

130
00:09:17,395 --> 00:09:20,387
I think they're great. I really do.

131
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:24,191
The big Lugwin had a thing for you.

132
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:25,883
They all had a thing for him.

133
00:09:25,883 --> 00:09:27,464
Oh, Mom.

134
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:30,265
Why is this girl going to call me?

135
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:36,314
She just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking or food....

136
00:09:36,414 --> 00:09:39,212
I told her you have a restaurant--

137
00:09:39,284 --> 00:09:41,735
I don't have, I work in a restaurant.

138
00:09:41,735 --> 00:09:44,186
They don't have to know that.

139
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,756
Ross, help me with the spaghetti.

140
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,320
Yes.

141
00:09:51,396 --> 00:09:55,298
Oh, we're having spaghetti. That's easy.

142
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:58,335
We were going to have lasagna.

143
00:09:58,403 --> 00:09:59,899
I love lasagna.

144
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,395
We're not having it.

145
00:10:02,407 --> 00:10:05,399
Then why bring it up? He latches on.

146
00:10:08,212 --> 00:10:14,412
This will sound unbelievably selfish but did you plan to bring up the baby/lesbian thing?

148
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,317
It might take the heat off of me.

149
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:24,260
That Rachel. We saw her parents at the club.

150
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:26,354
They were not playing well.

151
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:31,428
I won't say what they spent but $40,000 is a lot for a wedding.

153
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:38,375
At least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar.

154
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:42,863
What's that supposed to mean?

155
00:10:42,863 --> 00:10:44,347
Nothing.

156
00:10:44,482 --> 00:10:45,978
It's an expression.

157
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,474
No, it's not.

158
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:51,278
Don't listen to her. You've always been independent.

159
00:10:51,456 --> 00:10:57,284
Even when you were a chubby kid and you had no friends, you were just fine.

161
00:10:58,463 --> 00:11:01,489
You'd read alone in your room. Your puzzles....

162
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:09,305
People like Ross need to shoot for the stars.

163
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:12,342
With his museum and his published papers.

164
00:11:12,443 --> 00:11:16,243
Others are satisfied with staying where they are.

165
00:11:16,314 --> 00:11:18,441
These people never get cancer.

166
00:11:20,218 --> 00:11:25,245
They're happy with what they have, content like cows.

168
00:11:27,225 --> 00:11:28,351
Cows, Dad?

169
00:11:29,227 --> 00:11:31,422
She knows how much I love cows.

170
00:11:34,332 --> 00:11:41,428
I read about women trying to have it all, and I thank God our ''Harmonica'' doesn't have that problem.

172
00:11:43,274 --> 00:11:45,373
I'm telling you, you'll be fine.

173
00:11:45,373 --> 00:11:47,472
Thank you, Daddy.

174
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:52,245
Oh, so this does work.

175
00:11:55,253 --> 00:11:57,448
So, Ross, what's going on with you?

176
00:11:58,456 --> 00:12:03,393
Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?

177
00:12:07,198 --> 00:12:13,393
Look, I realize you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me.

179
00:12:14,205 --> 00:12:16,400
And so, well, here's the deal.

180
00:12:18,443 --> 00:12:20,240
Carol's a lesbian.

181
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:24,405
She lives with a woman named Susan.

182
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:29,318
She's pregnant with my child.

183
00:12:30,321 --> 00:12:33,313
She and Susan are going to raise the baby.

184
00:12:37,328 --> 00:12:38,522
And you knew about this?

185
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:48,431
Folks are really that bad?

186
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:52,368
Well, you know, these people are pros.

187
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:56,276
They know what they do.

188
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,316
They take their time. They get the job done.

189
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,212
They say that you can't change your parents.

190
00:13:05,323 --> 00:13:08,315
Boy, if you could, I'd want yours.

191
00:13:10,294 --> 00:13:11,283
Must pee.

192
00:13:13,231 --> 00:13:15,199
It's worse when you're twins.

193
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:16,228
You're a twin?

194
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,223
We don't speak.

195
00:13:17,301 --> 00:13:20,293
She's this high-powered, driven, career-type.

196
00:13:20,404 --> 00:13:21,854
What does she do?

197
00:13:21,854 --> 00:13:23,304
She's a waitress.

198
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:25,875
Identical?

199
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,308
People say we look alike.

200
00:13:27,411 --> 00:13:28,503
But I don't see it.

201
00:13:30,214 --> 00:13:33,206
You guys, I kind of gotta clean up now.

202
00:13:33,317 --> 00:13:36,252
Chandler, as an only child, you don't have this.

203
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,418
No, although I did have an imaginary friend who my parents preferred.

205
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,219
Hit the lights, please.

206
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:55,237
How long was I in there?

207
00:13:56,274 --> 00:13:58,322
I'm just cleaning up.

208
00:13:58,322 --> 00:14:00,370
Oh, you need any help?

209
00:14:02,313 --> 00:14:04,178
Okay, sure. Thanks.

210
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:10,376
Anyway....

211
00:14:11,422 --> 00:14:15,188
So you nervous about Barry tomorrow?

212
00:14:15,326 --> 00:14:16,418
A little.

213
00:14:18,396 --> 00:14:20,193
A lot.

214
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:23,426
So, got any advice?

215
00:14:24,202 --> 00:14:27,296
You know, as someone who's recently been dumped.

216
00:14:28,306 --> 00:14:32,208
You may wanna steer clear of the word ''dumped.''

217
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:37,338
Chances are he's gonna be this broken shell of a man.

218
00:14:37,448 --> 00:14:43,216
You should try not to look too terrific. I know it'll be hard.

219
00:14:45,323 --> 00:14:49,350
Or I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring.

220
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:54,329
And you can go with Carol and Susan to the ob-gyn.

221
00:14:56,334 --> 00:14:58,461
You've got Carol tomorrow.

222
00:14:59,437 --> 00:15:01,354
When did it get so complicated?

223
00:15:01,354 --> 00:15:03,271
Got me.

224
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,288
Remember being in high school?

225
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:06,368
Yeah.

226
00:15:07,178 --> 00:15:12,178
Didn't you think you'd meet someone fall in love, and that'd be it?

228
00:15:17,221 --> 00:15:18,250
Ross?

229
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,279
Yes. Yes.

230
00:15:22,193 --> 00:15:25,424
Man, I never thought I'd be here.

231
00:15:32,303 --> 00:15:33,395
Me neither.

232
00:15:51,255 --> 00:15:53,314
Sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work.

233
00:15:53,424 --> 00:15:57,258
There was this big dinosaur thing. Anyway....

234
00:15:58,229 --> 00:15:58,524
Hi.

235
00:16:00,197 --> 00:16:01,744
You remember Susan.

236
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:03,291
How could I forget?

237
00:16:04,402 --> 00:16:07,269
Hello, Susan. Good shake, good shake.

238
00:16:09,307 --> 00:16:12,276
So, we're just waiting for--?

239
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,356
Dr. Oberman.

240
00:16:13,356 --> 00:16:14,402
And is he--?

241
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:16,174
She.

242
00:16:16,174 --> 00:16:17,169
Of course, ''she.''

243
00:16:18,382 --> 00:16:22,375
Is she familiar with our special situation?

244
00:16:23,187 --> 00:16:25,183
Yes, and she's very supportive.

245
00:16:25,183 --> 00:16:27,179
Okay, that's great.

246
00:16:28,392 --> 00:16:29,381
No, I'm-- Oh.

247
00:16:31,295 --> 00:16:32,319
Thanks.

248
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,350
That opens my cervix.

249
00:17:01,192 --> 00:17:02,187
Barry?

250
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,182
Come on in.

251
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:05,156
Are you sure?

252
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:06,151
It's fine.

253
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,289
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

254
00:17:12,203 --> 00:17:13,397
So, how are you doing?

255
00:17:15,172 --> 00:17:16,161
I'm....

256
00:17:17,274 --> 00:17:18,366
I'm okay.

257
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:21,291
You look great.

258
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,371
Yeah, well.

259
00:17:23,314 --> 00:17:25,475
Dr. Farber, Jason Greenspan's gagging.

260
00:17:26,217 --> 00:17:29,186
Be right there. Be back in a second.

261
00:17:34,258 --> 00:17:35,418
I dumped him.

262
00:17:54,278 --> 00:17:57,338
So, how's this all gonna work?

263
00:17:57,415 --> 00:18:00,282
The baby grows in a special place inside--

264
00:18:00,351 --> 00:18:01,375
Thank you.

265
00:18:02,153 --> 00:18:06,146
I mean, how's this gonna work, you know, with us?

266
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,259
When important decisions have to be made?

267
00:18:09,393 --> 00:18:11,276
Give me a ''for instance.''

268
00:18:11,276 --> 00:18:13,159
Well, I don't know.

269
00:18:13,264 --> 00:18:14,811
How about with the baby's name?

270
00:18:14,811 --> 00:18:16,358
Marlon.

271
00:18:17,168 --> 00:18:19,295
If it's a boy. Minnie, if it's a girl.

272
00:18:21,372 --> 00:18:23,203
As in ''Mouse''?

273
00:18:24,408 --> 00:18:26,171
As in my grandmother.

274
00:18:27,178 --> 00:18:30,170
Still, you say ''Minnie,'' you hear ''Mouse.''

275
00:18:32,216 --> 00:18:33,410
How about...?

276
00:18:34,285 --> 00:18:35,377
How about Julia?

277
00:18:36,387 --> 00:18:37,786
Julia.

278
00:18:37,786 --> 00:18:39,185
We agreed on Minnie.

279
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:42,191
We agreed we'd spend our lives together.

280
00:18:42,293 --> 00:18:44,420
Things change. Roll with the punches.

281
00:18:45,396 --> 00:18:47,387
I believe Julia's on the table?

282
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:52,198
Sorry about that.

283
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:57,400
So, what have you been up to?

284
00:18:58,209 --> 00:19:00,234
Oh, not much.

285
00:19:01,145 --> 00:19:02,208
I got a job.

286
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,271
That's great.

287
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:06,246
Why are you so tan?

288
00:19:09,253 --> 00:19:11,187
I went to Aruba.

289
00:19:11,288 --> 00:19:14,189
Oh, no. You went on our honeymoon alone?

290
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,280
No.

291
00:19:19,163 --> 00:19:20,357
I went with....

292
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:23,216
Now, this may hurt.

293
00:19:23,216 --> 00:19:24,166
Me?

294
00:19:24,201 --> 00:19:25,259
No.

295
00:19:28,205 --> 00:19:29,263
I went with Mindy.

296
00:19:30,174 --> 00:19:31,198
Mindy?

297
00:19:32,276 --> 00:19:33,402
My maid of honor, Mindy?

298
00:19:34,211 --> 00:19:37,180
Yeah, we're kind of a thing now.

299
00:19:41,318 --> 00:19:43,286
You got plugs!

300
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,289
Careful. They haven't quite taken yet.

301
00:19:46,423 --> 00:19:48,323
And you got lenses.

302
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:52,285
You hate sticking your finger in your eye.

303
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:54,194
Not for her.

304
00:19:57,434 --> 00:20:00,301
Listen, I really wanted to thank you.

305
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:02,331
Okay.

306
00:20:03,307 --> 00:20:08,244
A month ago, I wanted to hurt you more than I've ever wanted to.

307
00:20:08,312 --> 00:20:10,303
And I'm an orthodontist.

308
00:20:12,316 --> 00:20:15,444
You know, you were right. I thought we were happy.

309
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,448
We weren't happy.

310
00:20:18,422 --> 00:20:23,259
But with Mindy now I'm happy.

312
00:20:24,328 --> 00:20:24,874
Spit.

313
00:20:24,874 --> 00:20:25,420
What?

314
00:20:25,462 --> 00:20:27,327
Me.

315
00:20:29,466 --> 00:20:31,263
Anyway....

316
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:37,363
I guess this belongs to you. Or maybe some day Mindy.

317
00:20:37,474 --> 00:20:40,272
Like she'd settle for that.

318
00:20:44,348 --> 00:20:46,373
Yeah, that's true.

319
00:20:46,483 --> 00:20:54,390
But I think it's a nice ring and thank you for giving it to me.

321
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:57,452
Thank you for giving it back.

322
00:21:00,231 --> 00:21:01,289
Hello!

323
00:21:05,202 --> 00:21:06,766
Please, what's wrong with Helen?

324
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,330
Helen Geller?

325
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,374
I don't think so.

326
00:21:11,374 --> 00:21:13,308
It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

327
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,923
Thank you.

328
00:21:14,923 --> 00:21:16,436
No, I mean, it's not Geller.

329
00:21:17,414 --> 00:21:19,245
It'll be Helen Willick?

330
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:24,410
No, actually, we talked about Helen Willick Bunch.

331
00:21:26,257 --> 00:21:28,452
Wait a minute. Why is she in the title?

332
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,352
It's my baby too.

333
00:21:30,427 --> 00:21:33,453
Really? I don't remember you making any sperm.

334
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:39,266
And we all know what a challenge that is.

335
00:21:40,237 --> 00:21:41,852
You two, stop it.

336
00:21:41,852 --> 00:21:43,467
She gets a credit. I'm in there too.

337
00:21:44,241 --> 00:21:49,440
Helen Willick Bunch Geller? I think that borders on child abuse.

338
00:21:50,247 --> 00:21:53,478
Of course not. I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.

339
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:58,347
See what he does? He knows no one's gonna say all those names.

340
00:21:58,455 --> 00:22:01,219
They'll call her Geller. He gets his way.

341
00:22:01,292 --> 00:22:03,317
My way? You think this is my way?

342
00:22:03,394 --> 00:22:11,232
Of all the ways I ever imagined this moment being this is not my-- You know what? This is too hard.

344
00:22:11,335 --> 00:22:14,236
Knock, knock. How are we? Any nausea?

345
00:22:14,305 --> 00:22:15,272
A little.

346
00:22:15,272 --> 00:22:16,239
Just a little.

347
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:22,440
I was wondering about the mother-to-be, but thanks for sharing.

348
00:22:23,247 --> 00:22:24,794
Lie back.

349
00:22:24,794 --> 00:22:26,341
You know what? I'm gonna go.

350
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,217
I don't think I can be involved in this family thing.

351
00:22:42,232 --> 00:22:43,329
Oh, my God!

352
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:44,426
Look at that.

353
00:22:44,468 --> 00:22:46,333
I know.

354
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,539
Well, isn't that amazing?

355
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:04,378
What are we supposed to be seeing here?

356
00:23:05,489 --> 00:23:10,324
I don't know, but I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.

357
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:19,431
If you tilt your head and relax your eyes it kind of looks like an old potato.

359
00:23:20,337 --> 00:23:22,498
Then don't do that, all right?

360
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:27,433
Monica, what do you think?

361
00:23:30,414 --> 00:23:31,426
Are you welling up?

362
00:23:31,426 --> 00:23:32,438
No.

363
00:23:33,217 --> 00:23:34,764
You are. You're welling up.

364
00:23:34,764 --> 00:23:36,311
I'm not.

365
00:23:36,353 --> 00:23:37,786
You're gonna be an aunt.

366
00:23:37,786 --> 00:23:39,219
Oh, shut up.

367
00:23:40,424 --> 00:23:44,326
Hi, Mindy. Hi, it's Rachel.

368
00:23:44,428 --> 00:23:48,330
Yeah, I'm fine. I saw Barry today.

369
00:23:48,432 --> 00:23:53,335
Yeah, he told me. No, it's okay. Really, it's okay.

370
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:57,238
I hope you two are very happy. I really do.

371
00:23:57,341 --> 00:24:08,274
And, Min, you know, if everything works out and you guys get married and have kids I hope they have his hairline and your nose!

374
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:17,283
That was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now!
