1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,992
For us, kissing is as important as any part.

2
00:00:03,103 --> 00:00:04,195
Yeah, right!

3
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:08,199
You serious?

4
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,141
Oh, yeah.

5
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:12,144
Everything is in that first kiss.

6
00:00:12,144 --> 00:00:14,044
Absolutely.

7
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:22,145
For us, kissing's an opening act like the comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.

10
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:29,025
And it's not that we don't like the comedian.

11
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:34,123
It's just that that's not why we bought the ticket.

12
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:44,074
The problem is, no matter how great the show was you girls are looking for the comedian again.

14
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:49,138
We're in the car, fighting traffic, just trying to stay awake.

15
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,086
Word of advice: Bring back the comedian.

16
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:59,023
Or next time you'll find yourself listening to that album alone.

17
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,097
Are we still talking about sex?

18
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:09,192
The One With the Sonogram at the End

19
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:59,185
No, it's good. It is good.

20
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:03,115
It's just that-- Doesn't she seem a little angry?

21
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,986
Well, she has issues.

22
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:07,983
Does she?

23
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:10,188
Try to live with ''Mr. I'm Evolving.''

24
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:17,995
He's out while she's home getting the mastodon smell out of the carpet.

25
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,198
Marsha, see, these are cave people.

26
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,234
Okay, they have issues like:

27
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:28,206
''Gee, that glacier's getting kind of close.''

28
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:32,048
Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?

29
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:33,086
No.

30
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,053
Yes, it is. Carol, hi!

31
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:38,147
Okay. Yes, it is. I'll catch up with you in the Ice Age.

32
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,208
Can I stay?

33
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:40,158
No.

34
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:55,638
Hi.

35
00:02:55,638 --> 00:02:56,201
Hi.

36
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,634
Is this a bad time?

37
00:03:05,634 --> 00:03:09,212
No, it's the Stone Age.

39
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:15,223
You look great. I hate that.

40
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,996
Sorry. Thanks. You look good too.

41
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:26,001
Well, you know, in here, anyone who...stands erect....

43
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,605
What's new? Still a--

44
00:03:30,605 --> 00:03:32,101
A lesbian?

45
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,244
You never know. How's the family?

46
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:40,615
Marty's still totally paranoid.

47
00:03:40,615 --> 00:03:43,112
Carol, why are you here?

48
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,155
I'm pregnant.

49
00:03:46,155 --> 00:03:47,252
Pregnant.

50
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,968
She didn't leave in such a hurry after all.

51
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:03,204
This is the Three's Company episode with a misunderstanding.

52
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:09,114
Then I've already seen this one.

53
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,083
Are you through with that?

54
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:15,086
Sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.

55
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:18,123
Whose ball of paper is this?

56
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:22,184
Mine. I wrote a note to myself, then I didn't need it.

57
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,221
So I balled it up and now I wish I was dead.

58
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:32,094
She already fluffed that pillow. You already fluffed-- It's fine.

59
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,203
I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition.

60
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:40,236
Parents can be cruel about the flatness of a child's pillow.

61
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:46,015
Relax, you do this every time. The place looks great.

62
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:51,156
You got a lasagna here that looks good enough to avoid touching.

64
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:55,990
Monica? Hi!

65
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,091
Monica, you're scaring me.

66
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:05,068
I mean, you're all chaotic and twirly, you know?

67
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,196
Not in a good way.

68
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:14,113
Calm down. You don't see Ross getting twirly every time they come.

69
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:18,116
That's because my parents think Ross can do no wrong.

70
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,176
You see, he's ''The Prince.''

71
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,088
They had some big ceremony before I was born.

72
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,091
What?

73
00:05:29,091 --> 00:05:30,188
Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.

74
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,102
Has anybody seen my engagement ring?

75
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:39,002
It's beautiful.

76
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,036
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

77
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:49,048
No, don't touch that.

78
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:55,951
Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back.

79
00:05:55,989 --> 00:06:01,052
''Hi, Barry, remember me? I'm the girl that stomped on your heart.''

80
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:07,957
Now I must return the ring without the ring which makes it so much harder.

82
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,192
Easy, we'll find it. Won't we?

83
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:17,004
Look, it's gonna be okay. You'll give it back and we'll eat ice cream.

85
00:06:17,004 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay. It's a pear-shaped diamond--

86
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,104
Any diamond ring we find, we'll run it by you.

87
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,196
When did you have it last?

88
00:06:26,196 --> 00:06:28,175
Doy, right before she lost it.

89
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,219
You don't get a lot of ''doy'' these days.

90
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:37,993
I know I had it this morning.

91
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:41,090
I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with--

92
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:42,998
Dinah?

93
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,553
Oh, don't be mad.

94
00:06:47,553 --> 00:06:49,100
You didn't.

95
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,222
Oh, I'm sorry.

96
00:06:51,222 --> 00:06:53,235
I gave you one job!

97
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:57,175
But look how straight those noodles are.

98
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:03,054
That's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagna.

99
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,989
I just can't do it.

100
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,962
Boys? We're going in.

101
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,095
Hi.

102
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,656
That is not a happy ''hi.''

103
00:07:24,656 --> 00:07:26,203
Carol's pregnant.

104
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,072
I found it!

105
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:33,209
What--?

106
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,111
Yeah.

107
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:41,025
Do that for two hours, you might be where I am about now.

108
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:45,088
That puts that whole pillow thing in perspective.

109
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,033
How do you fit into this whole thing?

110
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,003
Carol and Susan want me to be involved.

111
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:57,941
But if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.

112
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,026
It's totally up to me.

113
00:08:00,026 --> 00:08:02,074
She is so great. I miss her.

114
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,201
What does she mean by ''involved''?

115
00:08:09,201 --> 00:08:11,249
Your job is done.

116
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,188
And the most enjoyable.

117
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,154
Phoebe, say something.

118
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:24,968
They want me to go down to this sonogram thing with them tomorrow.

120
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:29,971
Remember when life was simpler and she was just a lesbian?

122
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:33,104
Those were the days.

123
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,578
What are you gonna do?

124
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:37,176
I have no idea.

125
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:41,176
No matter what I do, I'm still gonna be a father.

126
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:53,222
This is still ruined, right?

127
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:02,973
Martha Lugwin's daughter is gonna call you.

128
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,162
What's that curry taste?

129
00:09:07,162 --> 00:09:09,079
Curry.

130
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:16,178
I think they're great. I really do.

131
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,982
The big Lugwin had a thing for you.

132
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:21,674
They all had a thing for him.

133
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:23,255
Oh, Mom.

134
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:26,056
Why is this girl going to call me?

135
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:32,105
She just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking or food....

136
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:35,003
I told her you have a restaurant--

137
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,526
I don't have, I work in a restaurant.

138
00:09:37,526 --> 00:09:39,977
They don't have to know that.

139
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:45,547
Ross, help me with the spaghetti.

140
00:09:45,547 --> 00:09:47,111
Yes.

141
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:51,089
Oh, we're having spaghetti. That's easy.

142
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,126
We were going to have lasagna.

143
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,690
I love lasagna.

144
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,186
We're not having it.

145
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:01,190
Then why bring it up? He latches on.

146
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:10,203
This will sound unbelievably selfish but did you plan to bring up the baby/lesbian thing?

148
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,108
It might take the heat off of me.

149
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:20,051
That Rachel. We saw her parents at the club.

150
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,145
They were not playing well.

151
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:27,219
I won't say what they spent but $40,000 is a lot for a wedding.

153
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:34,166
At least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar.

154
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,654
What's that supposed to mean?

155
00:10:38,654 --> 00:10:40,138
Nothing.

156
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,769
It's an expression.

157
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:43,265
No, it's not.

158
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:47,069
Don't listen to her. You've always been independent.

159
00:10:47,247 --> 00:10:53,075
Even when you were a chubby kid and you had no friends, you were just fine.

161
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:57,280
You'd read alone in your room. Your puzzles....

162
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:05,096
People like Ross need to shoot for the stars.

163
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:08,133
With his museum and his published papers.

164
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:12,034
Others are satisfied with staying where they are.

165
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:14,232
These people never get cancer.

166
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:21,036
They're happy with what they have, content like cows.

168
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,142
Cows, Dad?

169
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,213
She knows how much I love cows.

170
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:37,219
I read about women trying to have it all, and I thank God our ''Harmonica'' doesn't have that problem.

172
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,164
I'm telling you, you'll be fine.

173
00:11:41,164 --> 00:11:43,263
Thank you, Daddy.

174
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:48,036
Oh, so this does work.

175
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,239
So, Ross, what's going on with you?

176
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:59,184
Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?

177
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:09,184
Look, I realize you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me.

179
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:12,191
And so, well, here's the deal.

180
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,031
Carol's a lesbian.

181
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,196
She lives with a woman named Susan.

182
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,109
She's pregnant with my child.

183
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:29,104
She and Susan are going to raise the baby.

184
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,313
And you knew about this?

185
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,222
Folks are really that bad?

186
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:48,159
Well, you know, these people are pros.

187
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,067
They know what they do.

188
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:56,107
They take their time. They get the job done.

189
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:01,003
They say that you can't change your parents.

190
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,106
Boy, if you could, I'd want yours.

191
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,074
Must pee.

192
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,990
It's worse when you're twins.

193
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,019
You're a twin?

194
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:13,014
We don't speak.

195
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:16,084
She's this high-powered, driven, career-type.

196
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,645
What does she do?

197
00:13:17,645 --> 00:13:19,095
She's a waitress.

198
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:21,666
Identical?

199
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,099
People say we look alike.

200
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,294
But I don't see it.

201
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,997
You guys, I kind of gotta clean up now.

202
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:32,043
Chandler, as an only child, you don't have this.

203
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:37,209
No, although I did have an imaginary friend who my parents preferred.

205
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,010
Hit the lights, please.

206
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,028
How long was I in there?

207
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,113
I'm just cleaning up.

208
00:13:54,113 --> 00:13:56,161
Oh, you need any help?

209
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,969
Okay, sure. Thanks.

210
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,167
Anyway....

211
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:10,979
So you nervous about Barry tomorrow?

212
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:12,209
A little.

213
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,984
A lot.

214
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,217
So, got any advice?

215
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:23,087
You know, as someone who's recently been dumped.

216
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:27,999
You may wanna steer clear of the word ''dumped.''

217
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:33,129
Chances are he's gonna be this broken shell of a man.

218
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:39,007
You should try not to look too terrific. I know it'll be hard.

219
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:45,141
Or I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring.

220
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:50,120
And you can go with Carol and Susan to the ob-gyn.

221
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,252
You've got Carol tomorrow.

222
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,145
When did it get so complicated?

223
00:14:57,145 --> 00:14:59,062
Got me.

224
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,079
Remember being in high school?

225
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:02,159
Yeah.

226
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:07,969
Didn't you think you'd meet someone fall in love, and that'd be it?

228
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:14,041
Ross?

229
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,070
Yes. Yes.

230
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:21,215
Man, I never thought I'd be here.

231
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,186
Me neither.

232
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:49,105
Sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work.

233
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:53,049
There was this big dinosaur thing. Anyway....

234
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,315
Hi.

235
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,535
You remember Susan.

236
00:15:57,535 --> 00:15:59,082
How could I forget?

237
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:03,060
Hello, Susan. Good shake, good shake.

238
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:08,067
So, we're just waiting for--?

239
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:09,147
Dr. Oberman.

240
00:16:09,147 --> 00:16:10,193
And is he--?

241
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,965
She.

242
00:16:11,965 --> 00:16:12,960
Of course, ''she.''

243
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:18,166
Is she familiar with our special situation?

244
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,974
Yes, and she's very supportive.

245
00:16:20,974 --> 00:16:22,970
Okay, that's great.

246
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,172
No, I'm-- Oh.

247
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:28,110
Thanks.

248
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,141
That opens my cervix.

249
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:57,978
Barry?

250
00:16:57,978 --> 00:16:58,973
Come on in.

251
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:00,947
Are you sure?

252
00:17:00,947 --> 00:17:01,942
It's fine.

253
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,080
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

254
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:09,188
So, how are you doing?

255
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:11,952
I'm....

256
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,157
I'm okay.

257
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,082
You look great.

258
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:18,162
Yeah, well.

259
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:21,266
Dr. Farber, Jason Greenspan's gagging.

260
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:24,977
Be right there. Be back in a second.

261
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,209
I dumped him.

262
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,129
So, how's this all gonna work?

263
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:56,073
The baby grows in a special place inside--

264
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:57,166
Thank you.

265
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:01,937
I mean, how's this gonna work, you know, with us?

266
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,050
When important decisions have to be made?

267
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,067
Give me a ''for instance.''

268
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:08,950
Well, I don't know.

269
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,602
How about with the baby's name?

270
00:18:10,602 --> 00:18:12,149
Marlon.

271
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:15,086
If it's a boy. Minnie, if it's a girl.

272
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:18,994
As in ''Mouse''?

273
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:21,962
As in my grandmother.

274
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:25,961
Still, you say ''Minnie,'' you hear ''Mouse.''

275
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,201
How about...?

276
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,168
How about Julia?

277
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:33,577
Julia.

278
00:18:33,577 --> 00:18:34,976
We agreed on Minnie.

279
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:37,982
We agreed we'd spend our lives together.

280
00:18:38,084 --> 00:18:40,211
Things change. Roll with the punches.

281
00:18:41,187 --> 00:18:43,178
I believe Julia's on the table?

282
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,989
Sorry about that.

283
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,191
So, what have you been up to?

284
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,025
Oh, not much.

285
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:57,999
I got a job.

286
00:18:57,999 --> 00:18:59,062
That's great.

287
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,037
Why are you so tan?

288
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:06,978
I went to Aruba.

289
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,980
Oh, no. You went on our honeymoon alone?

290
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,071
No.

291
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,148
I went with....

292
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:19,007
Now, this may hurt.

293
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:19,957
Me?

294
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,050
No.

295
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,054
I went with Mindy.

296
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:26,989
Mindy?

297
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,193
My maid of honor, Mindy?

298
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,971
Yeah, we're kind of a thing now.

299
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,077
You got plugs!

300
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:42,080
Careful. They haven't quite taken yet.

301
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,114
And you got lenses.

302
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:48,076
You hate sticking your finger in your eye.

303
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,985
Not for her.

304
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,092
Listen, I really wanted to thank you.

305
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,122
Okay.

306
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:04,035
A month ago, I wanted to hurt you more than I've ever wanted to.

307
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:06,094
And I'm an orthodontist.

308
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:11,235
You know, you were right. I thought we were happy.

309
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,239
We weren't happy.

310
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:19,050
But with Mindy now I'm happy.

312
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:20,665
Spit.

313
00:20:20,665 --> 00:20:21,211
What?

314
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,118
Me.

315
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,054
Anyway....

316
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:33,154
I guess this belongs to you. Or maybe some day Mindy.

317
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:36,063
Like she'd settle for that.

318
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:42,164
Yeah, that's true.

319
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:50,181
But I think it's a nice ring and thank you for giving it to me.

321
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,243
Thank you for giving it back.

322
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:57,080
Hello!

323
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,557
Please, what's wrong with Helen?

324
00:21:02,557 --> 00:21:04,121
Helen Geller?

325
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:07,165
I don't think so.

326
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:09,099
It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

327
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,714
Thank you.

328
00:21:10,714 --> 00:21:12,227
No, I mean, it's not Geller.

329
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,036
It'll be Helen Willick?

330
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:20,201
No, actually, we talked about Helen Willick Bunch.

331
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,243
Wait a minute. Why is she in the title?

332
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:26,143
It's my baby too.

333
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:29,244
Really? I don't remember you making any sperm.

334
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:35,057
And we all know what a challenge that is.

335
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,643
You two, stop it.

336
00:21:37,643 --> 00:21:39,258
She gets a credit. I'm in there too.

337
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:45,231
Helen Willick Bunch Geller? I think that borders on child abuse.

338
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:49,269
Of course not. I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.

339
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:54,138
See what he does? He knows no one's gonna say all those names.

340
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:57,010
They'll call her Geller. He gets his way.

341
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,108
My way? You think this is my way?

342
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:07,023
Of all the ways I ever imagined this moment being this is not my-- You know what? This is too hard.

344
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:10,027
Knock, knock. How are we? Any nausea?

345
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:11,063
A little.

346
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,030
Just a little.

347
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:18,231
I was wondering about the mother-to-be, but thanks for sharing.

348
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:20,585
Lie back.

349
00:22:20,585 --> 00:22:22,132
You know what? I'm gonna go.

350
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:27,008
I don't think I can be involved in this family thing.

351
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,120
Oh, my God!

352
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,217
Look at that.

353
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:42,124
I know.

354
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:54,330
Well, isn't that amazing?

355
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,169
What are we supposed to be seeing here?

356
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,115
I don't know, but I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.

357
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:15,222
If you tilt your head and relax your eyes it kind of looks like an old potato.

359
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:18,289
Then don't do that, all right?

360
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,224
Monica, what do you think?

361
00:23:26,205 --> 00:23:27,217
Are you welling up?

362
00:23:27,217 --> 00:23:28,229
No.

363
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:30,555
You are. You're welling up.

364
00:23:30,555 --> 00:23:32,102
I'm not.

365
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:33,577
You're gonna be an aunt.

366
00:23:33,577 --> 00:23:35,010
Oh, shut up.

367
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:40,117
Hi, Mindy. Hi, it's Rachel.

368
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:44,121
Yeah, I'm fine. I saw Barry today.

369
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:49,126
Yeah, he told me. No, it's okay. Really, it's okay.

370
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:53,029
I hope you two are very happy. I really do.

371
00:23:53,132 --> 00:24:04,065
And, Min, you know, if everything works out and you guys get married and have kids I hope they have his hairline and your nose!

374
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:13,074
That was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now!
