1
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:17,848
I'm sorry!

2
00:00:17,848 --> 00:00:19,247
That is it!

3
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,445
You barge in here and you don't knock?

4
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:25,383
You have no respect for privacy. No, you wait!

5
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,857
Can I just say one thing?

6
00:00:26,857 --> 00:00:28,256
What?!

7
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:34,296
That's a relatively open weave. I can still see...your nippular areas.

9
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:33,288
Honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are other things.

11
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,395
When the phone rings and she takes a shower.

12
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,264
That's pretty much it.

13
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,852
But you tell it really well, sweetie.

14
00:01:43,852 --> 00:01:46,303
Thanks. Okay.

15
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,273
Now go away so we can talk about you.

16
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,274
Okay. I'll miss you.

17
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,926
Isn't he great?

18
00:01:54,926 --> 00:01:56,473
He's cute. He likes you so much.

19
00:01:56,583 --> 00:02:00,451
I know. He's so sweet. And so complicated, you know?

20
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:04,246
And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky.

21
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,416
Think you'll do it on his couch?

22
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,394
I don't know. That's a little weird.

23
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,327
It's vinyl.

24
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,460
Okay, you guys want anything else?

25
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,851
Could I have--?

26
00:02:18,851 --> 00:02:20,432
We're all out. Anybody else?

27
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,274
Did I miss something?

28
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:26,436
No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.

29
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,349
What were you doing seeing her boobies?

30
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:36,286
It was an accident. I wasn't across the street with a telescope.

31
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,291
Can we change the subject, please?

32
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:43,386
These aren't her ''boobies.'' These are her breasts.

33
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:48,300
Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.

34
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,360
I always liked ''Bazoombas.''

35
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,302
Gives them a Latin spin.

36
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:57,509
Can we drop this already, please?

37
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:02,312
Why are you embarrassed? They were very nice boobies.

38
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,249
''Nice''? They were ''nice''?

39
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,253
That's it? I mean, mittens are ''nice.''

40
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,418
Okay. Rock, hard place. Me.

41
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:22,458
You're so funny!

42
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,464
He's really funny.

43
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:29,240
I wouldn't wanna be there when the laughter stops.

44
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:32,342
Whoa, back up there, sparky.

45
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,347
What did you mean by that?

46
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:43,244
It seems that maybe you have intimacy issues that you use your humor to keep people at a distance.

48
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:49,360
I mean, I just met you. I don't know you from Adam.

49
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,352
Only child, right?

50
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,399
Parents divorced before you hit puberty.

51
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,903
How did you know that?

52
00:03:58,903 --> 00:04:00,336
It's textbook.

53
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,401
Hey, you guys. You all know my dad, right?

54
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,877
How long are you in the city?

55
00:04:08,877 --> 00:04:10,441
Two days. I got a job.

56
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:16,220
I'm better off staying with Joey than going back and forth on the ferry.

58
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,818
I don't know this one.

59
00:04:17,818 --> 00:04:19,314
This is my friend Roger.

60
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,375
Good to meet you.

61
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,325
You too.

62
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,378
What happened to the puppet guy?

63
00:04:23,378 --> 00:04:25,329
Dad.

64
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:30,332
Oh, excuse me. So, Ross, how's the wife?

65
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,337
0 for 2, huh?

66
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,266
Chandler, say something funny.

67
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,285
I gotta go. Miss you too.

68
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,368
I love you, but it's getting late--

69
00:04:51,368 --> 00:04:53,347
Say hi. Hey, Ma.

70
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,361
I made the appointment with Dr. Bassida and--

71
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:59,456
Excuse me?

72
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,328
Did you know this isn't Ma?

73
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,215
Her name's Ronni.

74
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,250
She's a pet mortician.

75
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,311
Sure.

76
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,325
So, how long you been...?

77
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:33,255
Remember when you were a kid, I'd take you to the navy yard?

78
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,284
Since then?

79
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:37,235
No, it's only been six years.

80
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:42,365
I wanted you to think of a nice memory so you'd know I'm not a terrible guy.

81
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,390
What are you doing?

82
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,436
Chopping garlic.

83
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,344
You don't crush it?

84
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:53,249
You're having an affair, I chop garlic. It's a wacky world.

85
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,379
Joe, you ever been in love?

86
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,841
I don't know.

87
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:01,291
Then you haven't.

88
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,691
You're burning tomatoes.

89
00:06:03,691 --> 00:06:05,187
You're one to talk.

90
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,394
Your dad's in love. The worst part is, it's with two different women.

91
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,440
Oh, man! Please tell me one of them is Ma.

92
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:20,235
Of course one of them's Ma. What's the matter with you?

93
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:32,415
It's like if you woke up and found out your dad leads this double life.

95
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:36,451
He's like actually some spy working for the CIA.

96
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,455
That'd be cool.

97
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,229
This blows!

98
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,461
Do you think Dad cheated?

99
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,431
I don't think so. That would involve sex.

100
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,334
I'd like to think that our parents don't do that.

101
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:57,339
I know. Why can't parents just stay parents?

102
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,386
Why do they have to become people? Why do they have--?

103
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:08,385
Why...can't you stop staring at my breasts?

105
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,287
What?

106
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,424
What?

107
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:18,302
Didn't you get a good enough look?

108
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:22,500
We're all adults here. There's only one way to resolve this.

109
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:27,338
Since you saw her boobies you have to show her your pee-pee.

110
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,418
You know, I don't see that happening.

111
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,452
Come on. He's right. Tit for tat.

112
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:50,266
Well, I'm not showing you my tat!

113
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,467
-It's Phoebe.
-And Rog!

114
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,333
Come on up.

115
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:02,278
Oh, good! Rog is here.

116
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,283
What's the matter with Rog?

117
00:08:06,283 --> 00:08:09,184
It's a little thing. I hate that guy!

118
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:13,290
So he was a little analytical. That's what he does.

119
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,292
Come on, he's not that bad.

120
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:21,298
You're wrong! Why would I marry her if I thought that she was a lesbian?

122
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:25,395
I don't know. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.

123
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,212
Why? Why would I--? Why?

124
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:39,207
I don't know. Maybe low self-esteem?

125
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:43,448
Maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling. Maybe--

126
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,418
Wait! Go back to that ''sibling'' thing.

127
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:49,257
Well, I don't know.

128
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:56,333
You could've sabotaged your marriage so the sibling would feel like less of a failure.

130
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:04,165
That's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures.

131
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,276
You think I'm a failure?

132
00:09:08,276 --> 00:09:09,373
Isn't he good?

133
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:13,181
Yeah. No, that's not what I was saying.

134
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,220
I thought you were on my side.

135
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:19,223
But maybe you sucked up to them so they'd favor you.

136
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:23,194
I married a lesbian to make you look good!

137
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,401
You're right. I mean, you're right.

138
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:42,403
It wasn't just the Weebles, but the Weeble Play Palace...and the Weeble's Cruise Ship with this lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.

141
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,310
And Mom just gave them all away.

142
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:50,354
That's tough, tough stuff.

143
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:54,222
Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta go.

144
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,278
Feel better.

145
00:09:56,278 --> 00:09:58,229
We're gonna be late, sweetie.

146
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,748
Thanks for everything, Mon.

147
00:09:59,748 --> 00:10:01,232
No problem.

148
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,359
Listen, it was great seeing you again.

149
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,468
Mon, easy on those cookies, okay?

150
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:12,438
Remember, they're just food, they're not love.

151
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,544
I hate that guy!

152
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,479
Good night, you guys.

153
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,386
Oh, look. It's the woman we ordered.

154
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,491
Hey, can we help you?

155
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:39,361
No, thanks. I'm just waiting for Joey Tribbiani.

156
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:42,365
I'm Joey Tribbiani.

157
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:47,402
Oh, no, not you. Big Joey. Oh, my God!

158
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,381
You're so much cuter than your pictures.

159
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,382
I'm Ronni.

160
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,514
Cheese Nip?

161
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:05,320
Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a nip.

162
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:17,241
Most people, when their pets pass on want them like they're sleeping.

164
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:21,336
Occasionally you get a person who wants them in a pose.

165
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,439
Like chasing their tail.

166
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:27,480
Or jumping to catch a Frisbee.

167
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:32,390
Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.

168
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,457
That's a good one!

169
00:11:34,457 --> 00:11:35,355
Hey.

170
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,486
Hey, Dad. Ronni's here.

171
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,292
Hi.

172
00:11:39,292 --> 00:11:40,287
Hey.

173
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:45,269
Hello, babe! What are you doing here?

174
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,272
Oh, you left your hair at my place.

175
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,467
I thought you'd need it tomorrow.

176
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,379
Thank you.

177
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,316
So, who's up for a big game of IKerplunk?

178
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,414
Look, I shouldn't have come.

179
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,257
I better go. I'll miss the train.

180
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,341
I don't want you taking that thing.

181
00:12:11,341 --> 00:12:13,354
Where do I stay? Here?

182
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,425
We'll go to a hotel.

183
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,238
We'll go to a hotel.

184
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,457
No, you won't.

185
00:12:21,457 --> 00:12:22,441
No, we won't.

186
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,470
If you go to a hotel, you'll be doing stuff.

187
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,542
I want you here so I can keep an eye on you.

188
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,777
You're gonna keep an eye on us?

189
00:12:30,777 --> 00:12:32,273
Right.

190
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:37,380
As long as you are under my roof you're gonna live by my rules.

192
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,557
That means no sleeping with your girlfriend.

193
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:47,364
Wow, he's strict.

194
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,459
Dad, you'll be in my room. You can stay in Chandler's room.

195
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,472
And Chandler will be?

196
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,364
Out here with me, bunking up.

197
00:12:56,475 --> 00:13:01,208
Oh, bunking up. If you smell s'mores, don't be alarmed.

198
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,408
Thanks. You're a good kid.

199
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,440
I'll show you to my room.

200
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:11,355
That sounds weird not followed by, ''No, it's late.''

201
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:20,421
This is just for tonight. Tomorrow you gotta change.

202
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,455
Change?

203
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,252
Break up with Ronni--

204
00:13:23,252 --> 00:13:24,236
I can't!

205
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:27,328
Then come clean with Ma! This is not right!

206
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,272
I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!

207
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,482
Hey, kickie!

208
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,827
What are you doing?

209
00:13:49,827 --> 00:13:51,260
Getting comfortable.

210
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:52,910
I can't sleep in my underwear.

211
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,457
Well, you're gonna.

212
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:06,235
I was thinking about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls....

213
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:12,213
Are they end-to-end, or tall, like pancakes?

214
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,410
You know, how I date all these women.

215
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:22,317
I always figured, when the right one comes along I'll be able to go the distance.

217
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,228
Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking--

218
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,356
You're not him, you're you.

219
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:32,326
When they wanted you in your father's business, did you cave?

220
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:32,932
No.

221
00:14:32,932 --> 00:14:33,426
No.

222
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:37,340
You chose the out-of-work-actor business.

223
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,370
That wasn't easy, but you did it.

224
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:49,287
I believe when the right woman comes along you'll have the guts to say, ''No, thanks, I'm married.''

226
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,411
You really think so?

227
00:14:56,411 --> 00:14:58,362
Yeah, I really do.

228
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,364
Thanks, Chandler.

229
00:14:59,364 --> 00:15:00,331
Get off!

230
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,279
Hi.

231
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,246
Hi. May I help you?

232
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:20,308
Joey said I could use your shower since Chandler's in ours.

233
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,216
Okay. Who are you?

234
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,416
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rapalono.

235
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,259
The mistress?

236
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:30,859
Come on in.

237
00:15:30,859 --> 00:15:31,456
Thanks.

238
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,232
I'm Rachel. Bathroom's there.

239
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,427
Ronni, how long has Chandler been in the shower?

240
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,437
Oh, like five minutes.

241
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,235
Perfect.

242
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:48,337
Fasten your seat belts, it's pee-pee time.

243
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,965
Hey, Mr. Trib.

244
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:56,478
Hey, good morning, dear.

245
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:02,325
Chandler Bing, it's time to see your thing.

246
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,887
What's with you?

247
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:17,434
I thought it was Chandler!

248
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:21,440
You were supposed to be in there so I'd see your thing!

249
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,250
Sorry, my thing was in there with me.

250
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,255
How's it going?

251
00:16:36,255 --> 00:16:37,250
Good.

252
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:41,459
Roger's having a dinner thing. He wanted me to invite you guys.

253
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,352
So, what's going on?

254
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:47,467
Nothing.

255
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,262
It's just....

256
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,367
It's Roger, you know?

257
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,378
There's something about--

258
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,471
We just feel that he's....

259
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,346
We hate that guy!

260
00:16:58,346 --> 00:16:59,443
We hate him!

261
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,299
We're sorry, Pheebs.

262
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:02,379
Okay.

263
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:08,223
Don't you think it's just that he's so perceptive it freaked you out?

265
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,227
No, we hate him!

266
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,387
I'm sorry.

267
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,741
Ma! What are you doing here?

268
00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:30,272
I came to give you this and this!

269
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,281
Big ring!

270
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:38,246
Why'd you fill your father's head with garbage about making things right?

272
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,415
Things were fine this way!

273
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,421
There's chicken in there. Put it away.

274
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,424
For God's sake, Joey! Really.

275
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,398
Hold on. You knew?

276
00:17:51,398 --> 00:17:53,428
Of course I knew. What do you think?

277
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,530
Your father is no James Bond.

278
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,299
You should've heard his stories.

279
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,174
''I'm sleeping over at my accountant's.''

280
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,226
What is that? Please!

281
00:18:03,226 --> 00:18:05,239
So then, how could you--?

282
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:08,218
Do you remember how your father used to be?

283
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,381
Always yelling. Nothing made him happy.

284
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:16,326
Not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle.

285
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:21,195
Now he's happy. I mean, it's nice. He has a hobby.

286
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:30,207
Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful but what the hell are you talking about?

288
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,293
I mean, what about you?

289
00:18:32,293 --> 00:18:34,244
Me? I'm fine.

290
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:42,446
Look, honey, in an ideal world there'd be no her and your father would look like Sting.

292
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,355
And something else:

293
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:53,458
Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along he's so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive.

295
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:58,363
He's been more loving. It's like every day is our anniversary.

296
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,351
I'm happy for you?

297
00:19:00,351 --> 00:19:02,165
Well, don't be!

298
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,276
Now everything's screwed up.

299
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:11,177
I just want it the way it was.

300
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,218
Ma, I'm sorry.

301
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,379
I just did what I thought you'd want.

302
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:22,226
I know you did, cookie. I know you did.

303
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:29,223
So tell me. Did you see her?

304
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,494
Yeah.

305
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,400
You're 10 times prettier than she is.

306
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,396
That's sweet.

307
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,337
Could I take her?

308
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:44,211
With this ring, no contest.

309
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,418
Oh, no! Don't ever do that!

310
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:58,343
What?

311
00:19:58,343 --> 00:19:59,224
I'm sorry.

312
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,425
I have a thing, which means you can't ever do that!

313
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,884
What's wrong, sweetie?

314
00:20:06,884 --> 00:20:08,431
Nothing.

315
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,338
No, what's wrong? Come on.

316
00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:11,435
Okay.

317
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:20,240
It's nothing. I'm fine. It's just-- It's my friends.

318
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:26,256
They have a liking problem with you in that they don't.

320
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:30,483
They don't?

321
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:36,291
But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see.

322
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:40,269
They don't see all the good and sweet stuff.

323
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:41,919
They think you're a little--

324
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,466
What?

325
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,305
Intense and creepy.

326
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,895
Oh.

327
00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:51,510
But I don't. Me, Phoebe.

328
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,402
I'm not at all surprised about that.

329
00:20:56,402 --> 00:20:58,518
That's why you're so great.

330
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:05,419
It's quite typical behavior when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.

332
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:19,435
You know, this kind of codependent, emotionally stunted sitting in your stupid coffeehouse, with your stupid big cups which might as well have nipples on them.

335
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:25,348
And you're all like, ''Oh, define me! Define me!

336
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,351
Love me! I need love!''

337
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,388
You talked to your dad?

338
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,482
He's gonna keep cheating on Ma like she wanted.

339
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,455
Ma will keep pretending she doesn't know.

340
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:40,463
And my sister, Tina, can't see her husband.

341
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,490
He got a restraining order.

342
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:47,370
Which has nothing to do with it. I found out today.

343
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:51,501
Things have changed here on Waltons' mountain.

344
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:54,874
So, Joey, are you okay?

345
00:21:54,874 --> 00:21:56,370
Yeah, I guess.

346
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,508
It's just-- You know, they're parents.

347
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,445
After a certain point, you gotta let go.

348
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:06,314
You gotta let them make their own mistakes.

349
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:10,258
And think, in a few years, we'll turn into them.

350
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,421
Oh, please.

351
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:19,428
If I turn into my parents, I'll be an alcoholic blond chasing men or I'll end up like my mom!

353
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,271
Hey.

354
00:22:25,271 --> 00:22:26,266
Hey, Pheebs.

355
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,245
How's it going?

356
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,248
Okay, except I broke up with Roger.

357
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,415
Yeah, right.

358
00:22:34,415 --> 00:22:35,478
No, no, really.

359
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,888
What happened?

360
00:22:39,888 --> 00:22:45,457
I don't know. I mean he's a good person, and he can be really sweet.

362
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,357
In some ways, I think he is so right for me.

363
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,494
It's just.... I hate that guy!

364
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:02,242
Hi, Joey. What's going on?

365
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:05,214
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback.

366
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,410
Next stop, Rachel Greene.

367
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:15,417
Joey, what the hell were you doing?

368
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,421
Sorry, wrong boobies!

369
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,239
Hello, Joey!

370
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:35,437
Hello, dear!
