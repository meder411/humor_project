1
00:00:01,421 --> 00:00:04,322
Do you think they have yesterday's Daily News?

2
00:00:04,424 --> 00:00:08,190
I just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.

3
00:00:09,295 --> 00:00:17,293
Oh, my God! Don't look now. Behind you there's a guy who can break our hearts and plunge us into depression.

5
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,338
Come to mama.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,401
He's coming. Be cool. Be cool. Be cool.

7
00:00:23,443 --> 00:00:24,825
Nice hat.

8
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,207
Thanks.

9
00:00:26,412 --> 00:00:27,862
We should do something. Whistle.

10
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,312
I'm not whistling.

11
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:30,338
Come on, do it!

12
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,475
Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.

13
00:00:38,324 --> 00:00:40,417
I can't believe you did that.

14
00:01:28,341 --> 00:01:29,774
It's all my fault.

15
00:01:29,774 --> 00:01:31,207
No, it's mine.

16
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,210
Why did I whoo-hoo?

17
00:01:33,246 --> 00:01:38,441
Was I hoping he'd turn around and say ''I love that sound. I must have you now''?

19
00:01:39,419 --> 00:01:42,320
I wish there was something we could do.

20
00:01:45,224 --> 00:01:46,248
Hello, coma guy.

21
00:01:48,227 --> 00:01:50,218
Get up, you Girl Scout! Up, up, up!

22
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:51,353
What are you doing?

23
00:01:51,464 --> 00:01:53,432
Maybe nobody's tried this.

24
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:58,462
I wish we at least knew his name.

25
00:01:59,238 --> 00:02:01,365
I hate that they're calling him John Doe.

26
00:02:01,474 --> 00:02:05,308
It's so sad. It's like he's a deer, a female deer.

27
00:02:06,212 --> 00:02:08,271
Oh, I was gonna stop.

28
00:02:10,183 --> 00:02:11,343
Look at that face.

29
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:14,180
Even sleeping he looks smart.

30
00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:17,381
Yeah, but the dents in his knuckles mean he's artistic.

31
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:22,284
Okay. He's a lawyer who teaches sculpting on the side.

32
00:02:22,395 --> 00:02:24,226
And he can dance.

33
00:02:25,198 --> 00:02:34,329
And he's the kind of guy who, when you're talking, he's listening not saying, ''I understand'' but really wondering what you look like naked.

36
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,405
I wish all guys could be like him.

37
00:02:41,314 --> 00:02:42,338
I know.

38
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,354
You don't even know this guy.

39
00:02:49,455 --> 00:02:53,323
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?

40
00:02:54,327 --> 00:02:55,419
He doesn't have anyone.

41
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:58,224
We feel kind of responsible.

42
00:02:58,431 --> 00:03:01,195
I can't believe you said ''whoo-hoo.''

43
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,265
I don't even say ''whoo-hoo.''

44
00:03:03,369 --> 00:03:05,200
Oh, she's coming up.

45
00:03:05,271 --> 00:03:10,174
When we return, we'll talk with the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.

46
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:12,267
Put the kids to bed for this one.

47
00:03:12,378 --> 00:03:16,212
Don't watch this. Weekend at Bernie's is on Showtime and HBO.

48
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:17,271
No way.

49
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,367
She's your mom.

50
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:21,318
Exactly. Weekend at Bernie's.

51
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:25,289
Dead guy getting hit in the groin 20, 30 times.

52
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:29,384
I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books.

53
00:03:30,196 --> 00:03:32,391
I can't get on a plane without one. This is so cool.

54
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:40,202
You wouldn't think so if you were 1 1  and your friends were passing around page 79 of Mistress Bitch.

56
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:42,433
I remember page 79.

57
00:03:43,242 --> 00:03:47,338
The thing after the opera with the girl with the trick hip?

58
00:03:50,216 --> 00:03:52,241
I love your mom. I think she's a blast.

59
00:03:52,351 --> 00:03:54,319
That's because she's not your mom.

60
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,444
Oh, please. She's the--

61
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:57,517
Hi, sweetie.

62
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,359
When did ''Rigatoni'' get back from Rome?

63
00:04:04,163 --> 00:04:04,709
Last night.

64
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:05,255
Really?

65
00:04:05,364 --> 00:04:08,390
So, his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?

66
00:04:09,202 --> 00:04:10,464
Just a dream I had.

67
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,259
But, phew!

68
00:04:13,406 --> 00:04:15,169
Hey, she's on.

69
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:19,371
Nora Bing.

70
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,376
Back to the book. What is this about you being arrested in London?

71
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:27,379
Your mom was arrested?

72
00:04:27,486 --> 00:04:29,420
I'm busy beaming with pride.

73
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:36,418
This is kind of embarrassing...but occasionally, after I've been intimate with a man...

75
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:39,389
Why would she say that's embarrassing?

76
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,425
...I just get this craving for kung pao chicken.

77
00:04:44,237 --> 00:04:46,228
That's too much information.

78
00:04:50,309 --> 00:04:54,302
Needless to say, he got a huge tip.

79
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,410
Oh, God, I love her!

80
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:01,181
I think I'm having a stroke.

81
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:05,189
So how is your book tour going?

82
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:09,284
Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate.

83
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:11,454
But I get to see my son, who I love.

84
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:17,301
This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.

85
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,406
Don't take this wrong, I just don't see you as a mom.

86
00:05:22,174 --> 00:05:25,473
-I don't mean that bad.
-Oh, no. I'm a fabulous mom.

87
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:28,313
I bought my son his first condoms.

88
00:05:34,387 --> 00:05:36,480
And then he burst into flames.

89
00:05:45,398 --> 00:05:49,494
Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit-reduction bill.

90
00:05:50,236 --> 00:05:55,196
The mayor wants to raise subway fares. The high today was 45.

91
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,233
And teams played sports.

92
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:26,200
What about Glen?

93
00:06:26,372 --> 00:06:27,396
He could be a Glen.

94
00:06:28,174 --> 00:06:29,402
Not special enough.

95
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:32,277
How about Agamemnon?

96
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:35,174
Way too special.

97
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:45,282
I'm famished. What do I want?

98
00:06:45,391 --> 00:06:48,417
Please, God, don't let it be kung pao chicken.

99
00:06:49,228 --> 00:06:52,197
You watched the show. What did you think?

100
00:06:52,231 --> 00:06:54,426
I think you need to come out of your shell.

101
00:06:57,403 --> 00:06:59,303
What is this dive?

102
00:06:59,405 --> 00:07:01,373
Only you could've picked this place.

103
00:07:02,274 --> 00:07:05,334
Come on. Shut up. It's fun. Give me a hug.

104
00:07:06,178 --> 00:07:09,375
I heard about the divorce. Lesbian, huh?

105
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:16,144
Well, you know what they say: Be careful what you wish for.

106
00:07:18,257 --> 00:07:19,724
I think we're ready for some tequila.

107
00:07:19,724 --> 00:07:21,191
I know I am.

108
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,255
Who's doing shots?

109
00:07:22,255 --> 00:07:23,250
Hit me.

110
00:07:23,295 --> 00:07:24,353
There you go. Ross?

111
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:27,357
I'm not really a shot-drinking kind of guy.

112
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:29,361
Hi. Sorry we're late.

113
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:33,270
We kind of just, you know, lost track of time.

114
00:07:35,374 --> 00:07:37,308
But a man can change.

115
00:07:43,282 --> 00:07:45,409
Anyone want me to appraise anything?

116
00:07:56,395 --> 00:07:59,330
Well, I'm gonna go to tinker-town.

117
00:07:59,398 --> 00:08:02,333
Mrs. Bing, I've read everything you've written.

118
00:08:03,135 --> 00:08:07,128
When I read Euphoria at Midnight, I wanted to become a writer.

119
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:10,140
Oh, please. If I can do it, anybody can.

120
00:08:10,276 --> 00:08:18,180
Start with half a dozen European cities throw in 30 euphemisms for male genitalia and you've got yourself a book.

123
00:08:19,285 --> 00:08:22,152
My mother, ladies and gentlemen.

124
00:08:25,157 --> 00:08:28,149
Yeah, any messages for room 226?

125
00:08:29,295 --> 00:08:30,825
You okay, slugger?

126
00:08:30,825 --> 00:08:32,355
Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

127
00:08:45,277 --> 00:08:47,177
What is with you tonight?

128
00:08:47,213 --> 00:08:49,408
Nothing. Nothing, nothing.

129
00:08:50,382 --> 00:08:52,179
Okay, thank you.

130
00:08:55,221 --> 00:08:57,451
It's the Italian hand-licker, isn't it?

131
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,315
No. It's the one he's licking.

132
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,328
She's supposed to be with you.

133
00:09:04,263 --> 00:09:05,321
You're good.

134
00:09:06,332 --> 00:09:11,235
I have sold 100 million copies of my books, and you know why?

135
00:09:11,437 --> 00:09:14,372
The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?

136
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:21,335
No, because I know how to write men that women fall in love with.

137
00:09:22,181 --> 00:09:24,149
I cannot sell a Paolo.

138
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,242
People will not turn 325 pages for a Paolo.

139
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:30,345
Come on. The guy's a secondary character.

140
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:34,250
He's just a complication you eventually kill off.

141
00:09:35,361 --> 00:09:36,385
When?

142
00:09:39,164 --> 00:09:41,257
He's not a hero.

143
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:43,361
You know who our hero is?

144
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:46,296
The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?

145
00:09:47,273 --> 00:09:48,365
No, it's you.

146
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:49,720
Please.

147
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,266
No, really.

148
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:53,174
Come on. You're smart. You're sexy.

149
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:54,329
Right.

150
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:55,279
Yes, you are.

151
00:09:55,381 --> 00:09:59,215
The fact that you don't think you are makes you sexier.

152
00:09:59,285 --> 00:10:03,278
Come on, kiddo. You're gonna be fine, believe me.

153
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,505
I'll just pee in the street.

154
00:10:34,253 --> 00:10:35,242
Is Chandler here?

155
00:10:35,454 --> 00:10:37,217
Wait. Come here.

156
00:10:38,424 --> 00:10:44,262
Okay, about last night you know Chandler, you didn't tell....

159
00:10:44,363 --> 00:10:48,459
We don't need to tell Chandler. It was just a kiss. No big deal, right?

160
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:50,462
Right. No big deal.

161
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,430
In bizarro world.

162
00:10:56,342 --> 00:10:57,331
You broke the code.

163
00:10:57,443 --> 00:10:58,876
What code?

164
00:10:58,876 --> 00:11:00,309
You don't kiss your friend's mom.

165
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:04,281
Sisters are okay. Maybe a hot-looking aunt.

166
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:06,477
But not a mom. Never a mom.

167
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:11,389
What are you guys doing out here?

168
00:11:12,191 --> 00:11:15,319
Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game.

169
00:11:17,196 --> 00:11:20,222
But apparently somebody overslept.

170
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:23,498
Well, you don't have your racquet.

171
00:11:24,236 --> 00:11:26,431
No. No, I don't because it's being restrung.

172
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:29,298
Somebody was supposed to bring me one.

173
00:11:30,342 --> 00:11:33,334
Well, you didn't call and leave your grip size.

174
00:11:35,447 --> 00:11:38,416
You guys are spending way too much time together.

175
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,251
I'm scum. I'm scum.

176
00:11:43,355 --> 00:11:44,401
How could you let this happen?

177
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:45,447
I don't know.

178
00:11:46,258 --> 00:11:48,226
It's not like she's a regular mom.

179
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:50,227
She's sexy. She's....

180
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:52,354
You don't think my mom's sexy?

181
00:11:53,465 --> 00:11:56,332
Well, not in the same way.

182
00:11:56,435 --> 00:12:00,371
I'll have you know, Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day.

183
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:05,268
You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?

184
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,271
Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here.

185
00:12:12,384 --> 00:12:14,181
What are you doing here?

186
00:12:15,387 --> 00:12:17,287
Not playing racquetball.

187
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:21,387
He forgot to leave his grip size.

188
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:23,383
He didn't get the goggles.

189
00:12:25,431 --> 00:12:28,229
Sounds like you two have issues.

190
00:12:31,303 --> 00:12:32,327
Goodbye, baby.

191
00:12:34,506 --> 00:12:37,236
Do they wait for me to do this?

192
00:12:43,315 --> 00:12:44,811
Are you gonna tell him?

193
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:46,307
Why would I tell him?

194
00:12:46,418 --> 00:12:49,216
If you don't, his mother might.

195
00:12:50,322 --> 00:12:52,415
What are you guys doing here?

196
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:55,418
He's not even wearing a jock strap.

197
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,191
What did I ask?

198
00:13:17,382 --> 00:13:19,213
What are you doing here?

199
00:13:19,284 --> 00:13:24,184
Nothing. I just thought I'd stop by, you know, after that I, you know.

201
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:26,189
So, what are you doing here?

202
00:13:27,226 --> 00:13:29,194
I'm not really here.

203
00:13:29,294 --> 00:13:33,390
I just thought I'd drop these off on the way. My way.

204
00:13:36,235 --> 00:13:41,201
Do you come here a lot without me?

206
00:13:41,306 --> 00:13:43,297
No, no, no.

207
00:13:46,411 --> 00:13:50,211
Do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?

208
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,214
How would I know? I wasn't here.

209
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:57,413
Really? Not even to change his pajamas?

210
00:14:01,393 --> 00:14:02,360
Oh, my God.

211
00:14:03,162 --> 00:14:05,357
You're my friend. I had to tell you.

212
00:14:06,165 --> 00:14:07,359
I can't believe it.

213
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:10,164
Paolo kissed my mom?

214
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,296
I don't know if you noticed, but he drank a lot.

215
00:14:14,406 --> 00:14:17,273
I mean, you know how he gets--

216
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:21,212
I can't do this. I did it.

217
00:14:21,313 --> 00:14:23,406
It was me. I'm sorry. I kissed your mom.

218
00:14:24,283 --> 00:14:25,272
What?

219
00:14:25,484 --> 00:14:37,191
I was upset about Rachel and I had too much tequila, and Nora Mrs. Mom, your Bing, was...being nice. But nothing happened.

222
00:14:37,296 --> 00:14:38,285
Nothing. Ask Joey.

223
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,914
Joey came in--

224
00:14:39,914 --> 00:14:41,398
You knew about this?

225
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:44,396
You know, knowledge is a tricky thing.

226
00:14:45,337 --> 00:14:47,430
Why didn't you tell me?

227
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,437
You're lucky I caught them, or else who knows what would've happened?

228
00:14:52,244 --> 00:14:53,336
Thanks, man. Big help.

229
00:14:54,313 --> 00:14:56,304
What the hell were you thinking?

230
00:14:56,415 --> 00:14:58,406
I wasn't. I don't know. I--

231
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:02,181
No one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.

232
00:15:02,254 --> 00:15:03,266
I know.

233
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:04,278
I can't believe you did this.

234
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:05,771
Me neither.

235
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,153
I'm mad at you too.

236
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:08,709
Why are you mad at me--?

237
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,159
Let me slam the door.

238
00:15:11,263 --> 00:15:15,256
I didn't kiss her. See what happens when you break the code?

239
00:15:28,413 --> 00:15:31,405
''A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Greene.''

240
00:15:32,184 --> 00:15:35,278
I thought I'd give it a shot. I'm on the first chapter.

241
00:15:35,387 --> 00:15:40,381
Do you think his ''love stick'' can be ''liberated from its denim prison''?

242
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:44,319
Yeah, I'd say so.

243
00:15:44,496 --> 00:15:48,193
And there's no ''J'' in ''engorged.''

244
00:15:53,338 --> 00:15:54,771
You going to the hospital tonight?

245
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:56,204
No. You?

246
00:15:56,408 --> 00:15:57,432
No. You?

247
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:02,270
You just asked me.

248
00:16:02,347 --> 00:16:04,338
Maybe it was a trick question.

249
00:16:06,285 --> 00:16:08,378
Rachel, can we do this now?

250
00:16:10,355 --> 00:16:12,346
I am so hot.

251
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:17,194
Here's my mom and dad on their wedding day.

252
00:16:17,296 --> 00:16:20,288
Now, you tell me she's not a knockout.

253
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:24,818
I can't believe this conversation.

254
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,469
Just try to picture her not pregnant.

255
00:16:28,373 --> 00:16:33,276
Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.

256
00:16:34,313 --> 00:16:35,280
Thanks.

257
00:16:37,382 --> 00:16:45,322
I'd like to start with a song about a man I recently met who's come to be very important to me.

259
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:54,331
You don't have to be awake To be my man

260
00:16:56,435 --> 00:17:01,338
Long as you have brain waves I'll be there to hold your hand

261
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:05,200
Though we just met the other day

262
00:17:05,344 --> 00:17:09,144
There's something I have got to say

263
00:17:10,182 --> 00:17:13,151
Thank you very much. I'm gonna take a short break.

264
00:17:15,354 --> 00:17:19,154
That was Phoebe Buffay, everybody.

265
00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:21,692
What the hell was that?

266
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:23,159
Phoebe just started--

267
00:17:23,228 --> 00:17:27,289
I was talking to Joey. All right, there, mother-kisser?

268
00:17:32,237 --> 00:17:33,363
''Mother-kisser.''

269
00:17:35,273 --> 00:17:36,297
I'll shut up.

270
00:17:36,408 --> 00:17:42,246
I know you're still mad at me but there were two people there that night.

272
00:17:42,414 --> 00:17:43,910
There were two sets of lips.

273
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,406
I expect this from her.

274
00:17:46,284 --> 00:17:48,411
She's always been a Freudian nightmare.

275
00:17:49,187 --> 00:17:52,213
Then why don't you say something?

276
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:55,259
Because it's complicated. It's complex.

277
00:17:55,394 --> 00:17:57,191
You kissed my mom.

278
00:18:00,432 --> 00:18:03,128
We're rehearsing a Greek play.

279
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:06,203
That's funny. Are we done now?

280
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:09,331
You mean you're not gonna tell her how you feel?

281
00:18:10,142 --> 00:18:16,271
Just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. You can't talk to her.

283
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:19,145
Okay. ''You can't''? Or you can't?

284
00:18:20,285 --> 00:18:21,377
Okay, that's my finger.

285
00:18:22,187 --> 00:18:24,348
Okay, that's my knee.

286
00:18:25,157 --> 00:18:26,249
Still doing the play.

287
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:36,293
What did you do with him?

288
00:18:40,405 --> 00:18:41,389
You're awake.

289
00:18:41,389 --> 00:18:42,373
Look at you.

290
00:18:43,175 --> 00:18:44,403
How do you feel?

291
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,201
A little woozy, but basically okay.

292
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:49,270
Gosh, you look good.

293
00:18:49,314 --> 00:18:50,406
I feel good.

294
00:18:52,217 --> 00:18:53,377
Who are you?

295
00:18:53,418 --> 00:18:54,368
Sorry.

296
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:55,318
I'm Phoebe.

297
00:18:55,387 --> 00:18:58,220
I'm Monica. I've been caring for you.

298
00:18:58,323 --> 00:18:59,290
We both have.

299
00:18:59,424 --> 00:19:00,874
The Etch A Sketch is from you?

300
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:02,324
Actually, me.

301
00:19:03,128 --> 00:19:04,225
I got you the foot massager.

302
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:05,322
I shaved you.

303
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,795
I read to you.

304
00:19:06,795 --> 00:19:08,160
I sang.

305
00:19:10,235 --> 00:19:11,327
Well, thanks.

306
00:19:12,137 --> 00:19:13,183
Oh, my pleasure.

307
00:19:13,183 --> 00:19:14,229
You're welcome.

308
00:19:14,272 --> 00:19:17,241
So I guess I'll see you around.

309
00:19:18,343 --> 00:19:20,243
What? That's it?

310
00:19:21,146 --> 00:19:22,272
''See you around''?

311
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,876
What do you want me to say?

312
00:19:23,876 --> 00:19:25,372
I don't know.

313
00:19:26,184 --> 00:19:29,149
Maybe ''That was nice.''

315
00:19:29,254 --> 00:19:30,346
''It meant something to me.''

316
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:33,254
''I'll call you.''

317
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:35,839
Okay. I'll call you.

318
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,386
I don't think you mean that.

319
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:43,167
This is so typical.

320
00:19:43,301 --> 00:19:47,465
You know, we give and we give and we give.

322
00:19:48,206 --> 00:19:50,265
And we just get nothing back.

323
00:19:50,308 --> 00:19:54,267
And then one day, you wake up, and it's, ''See you around.''

324
00:19:56,381 --> 00:19:58,178
Let's go, Phoebe.

325
00:20:00,218 --> 00:20:03,312
You know what? We thought you were different.

326
00:20:03,388 --> 00:20:05,481
But I guess it was just the coma.

327
00:20:16,301 --> 00:20:20,294
The car's waiting. I just wanted to drop off my book for your friends.

328
00:20:20,338 --> 00:20:24,240
Autographed. And give you a goodbye kiss.

329
00:20:24,342 --> 00:20:27,311
Here's the kiss, here's the goodbye....

330
00:20:27,445 --> 00:20:29,845
Anything you want from Lisbon?

331
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:32,245
Just knowing you're there is enough.

332
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:36,217
All right. Well, be good. I love you.

333
00:20:39,257 --> 00:20:41,350
You kissed my best Ross.

334
00:20:43,428 --> 00:20:46,226
Or something to that effect.

335
00:20:52,337 --> 00:20:54,271
Look, it was stupid.

336
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:55,351
Really stupid.

337
00:20:55,351 --> 00:20:56,363
Really stupid.

338
00:20:58,543 --> 00:21:01,205
I don't even know how it happened.

339
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:06,214
I'm sorry, honey. I promise it will never happen again.

340
00:21:06,318 --> 00:21:08,218
Really, really stupid.

341
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,413
Really, really stupid.

342
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,253
Are we okay now?

343
00:21:13,253 --> 00:21:14,316
Yeah.

344
00:21:14,492 --> 00:21:16,187
No.

345
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:24,325
The forbidden love of a man and his door.

346
00:21:26,304 --> 00:21:29,398
He told her off. And not just about the kiss.

347
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:30,430
You're kidding?

348
00:21:31,243 --> 00:21:34,337
He said, ''When are you gonna start being a mom?''

349
00:21:34,412 --> 00:21:35,436
Then she said:

350
00:21:36,248 --> 00:21:40,344
''The question is, when are you gonna realize I have a bomb?''

351
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,354
Are you sure she didn't say:

352
00:21:44,422 --> 00:21:49,359
''When are you gonna grow up and realize I am your mom?''

353
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:52,979
That makes more sense.

354
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,429
You think?

355
00:21:56,268 --> 00:21:57,360
What's going on now?

356
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:02,172
I don't know. I've been standing here spelling it out for you.

357
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,275
I don't hear anything. Wait.

358
00:22:05,377 --> 00:22:06,366
What do you see?

359
00:22:07,178 --> 00:22:09,271
It's hard to tell. They're tiny and upside down.

360
00:22:09,381 --> 00:22:10,405
Wait, wait, wait.

361
00:22:11,216 --> 00:22:14,208
They're walking away. They're walking away.

362
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:18,287
No, they're not. They're coming right at us. Run!

363
00:22:20,425 --> 00:22:21,858
Are you okay, kiddo?

364
00:22:21,858 --> 00:22:23,291
Yeah, I'm okay.

365
00:22:23,395 --> 00:22:25,295
All right. You be good.

366
00:22:25,397 --> 00:22:27,228
Drive safe.

367
00:22:29,234 --> 00:22:30,263
Mrs. Bing.

368
00:22:30,263 --> 00:22:31,292
Mr. Geller.

369
00:22:40,312 --> 00:22:41,404
You mean that?

370
00:22:42,347 --> 00:22:43,439
Yeah, why not?

371
00:22:46,318 --> 00:22:48,309
So I told her.

372
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,387
How did it go?

373
00:22:49,387 --> 00:22:50,354
Awful. Awful.

374
00:22:50,522 --> 00:22:52,353
Couldn't have gone worse.

375
00:22:53,425 --> 00:22:54,875
Well, how do you feel?

376
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,325
Pretty good.

377
00:22:58,363 --> 00:22:59,421
I told her.

378
00:23:00,198 --> 00:23:01,392
Well, see?

379
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,261
So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, me kissing your mom, huh?

380
00:23:06,371 --> 00:23:09,397
But we don't have to go down that road.

381
00:23:15,413 --> 00:23:22,380
This is just the first chapter and I want your absolute honest opinion. Okay?

383
00:23:23,288 --> 00:23:27,281
And on page two, he's not reaching for her ''heaving beasts.''

384
00:23:29,194 --> 00:23:30,491
She could have heaving beasts.

385
00:23:31,396 --> 00:23:34,388
Right, but in this case she doesn't.

386
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,289
What's a ''niffle''?

387
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:39,336
You can usually find them on the heaving beasts.

388
00:23:41,406 --> 00:23:43,431
Okay, so I'm not a great typist.

389
00:23:44,242 --> 00:23:48,235
Did you get to the part about his ''huge, throbbing pens''?

390
00:23:48,446 --> 00:23:52,405
You don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those.

391
00:23:53,351 --> 00:23:55,342
That's it. Give them back.

392
00:23:56,254 --> 00:24:00,384
Wait, I just got to the part about her ''public hair.''
