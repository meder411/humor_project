1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,029
Ross: How did it go?

2
00:00:01,029 --> 00:00:02,058
Phoebe: Not so good.

3
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:05,195
Phoebe: He walked me home and said, ''Let's do this again.''

4
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:09,176
Phoebe: He said, ''Let's do this again.'' That's good, right?

5
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:15,005
Monica: Translated, ''Let's do this again'' means, ''You'll never see me naked.''

6
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,175
Rachel: Since when?

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,078
Joey: Since always. It's, like, dating language.

8
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:24,182
Joey: Like, ''It's not you'' means, ''It is you.''

9
00:00:25,993 --> 00:00:32,022
Chandler: ''You're nice'' means, ''I'll be dating alcoholics and complaining about them to you.''

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,127
Phoebe: ''We should see other people'' means:

12
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:37,101
Phoebe: ''Ha-ha, I already am!''

13
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,098
Rachel: Everybody knows this?

14
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,132
Joey: Cushions the blow.

15
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:47,138
Chandler: Like your parents putting the dog to sleep and saying it went to a farm.

17
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:54,178
Ross: That's funny. Because our parents actually did send our dog off to live on a farm.

19
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:56,149
Monica: Ross?

20
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:00,187
Ross: Hello! The Milner's farm in Connecticut?

21
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:03,088
Ross: The Milners had this unbelievable farm.

22
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:05,997
Ross: They had horses and rabbits to chase.

23
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,192
Ross: And it was....

24
00:01:10,971 --> 00:01:12,996
Ross: Oh, my God! Chi-Chi!

25
00:01:15,109 --> 00:01:18,078
The One With the Thumb

26
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,995
Chandler: How does it feel knowing you're about to die?

27
00:02:09,063 --> 00:02:12,157
Joey: Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over.

28
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:17,165
Joey: But you'll live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.

29
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,998
Chandler: That was really good!

30
00:02:21,075 --> 00:02:22,975
Joey: Thanks. Let's keep going.

31
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:27,013
Chandler: So, what do you want from me, Dimon? Huh?

32
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:33,176
Joey: I just wanna go back to my cell, because in my cell I can smoke.

33
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,979
Chandler: Smoke away!

34
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:52,102
Chandler: I think this is why Dimon smokes in his cell alone.

35
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,052
Joey: What?

36
00:02:54,052 --> 00:02:55,064
Chandler: Relax your hand.

37
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:57,076
Let your wrist go.

38
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:59,044
Chandler: Not so much!

39
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:02,945
Chandler: All right. Now take a puff.

40
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,948
Chandler: Right.

41
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:08,517
Chandler: Give it to me.

42
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:10,047
Joey: I'm not giving you a cigarette.

43
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:14,049
Chandler: It's fine. Do you want to get this part or not? Here.

44
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:17,153
Chandler: Now, don't think of it as a cigarette.

45
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:21,998
Chandler: Think of it as the thing that has been missing from your hand.

46
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:24,194
Chandler: When you hold it, you feel right.

47
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:26,061
Chandler: You feel complete.

48
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:28,071
Joey: You miss it?

49
00:03:28,071 --> 00:03:29,168
Chandler: No, not so much.

50
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:33,970
Chandler: All right. Now we smoke.

51
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:39,008
Chandler: Oh, my God!

52
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:40,103
Give me that!

53
00:03:40,103 --> 00:03:41,087
No. You've got options.

54
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:43,019
You can smoke like this:

55
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,136
Chandler--

56
00:03:44,136 --> 00:03:45,182
Or hold it in your mouth.

57
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,022
Give me the cigarette!

58
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:47,707
You try.

59
00:03:47,707 --> 00:03:48,287
Thank you.

60
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:51,088
Okay, how's this?

61
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,959
Okay, that's not bad.

62
00:03:56,036 --> 00:04:00,063
All right, when you're finished, it's cool if you flick it.

63
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:08,046
All right, you keep practicing and I'll go put out the sofa.

65
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:14,077
I thought it was foot size.

66
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:21,093
Monica: No. It's the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.

68
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,157
Joey: That's ridiculous.

69
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,063
Ross: Can I use either thumb?

70
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:35,066
I'd rather go with the foot theory.

71
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:38,167
Rachel: All right. Don't tell me.

72
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:42,173
Rachel: Decaf cappuccino for Joey.

73
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:45,986
Rachel: Coffee, black.

74
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,984
Rachel: Latte.

75
00:04:50,024 --> 00:04:51,116
Rachel: And an iced tea.

76
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:53,493
Rachel: I'm getting good at this.

77
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,960
All: Excellent!

78
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:56,121
Rachel: Good for me!

79
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:11,560
Joey: You okay, Phoebe?

80
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,976
Phoebe: It's not worth--

81
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,240
Phoebe: It's my bank.

82
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,011
Monica: What did they do?

83
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:17,040
Phoebe: It's nothing--

84
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:20,985
Phoebe: I get my mail and open their monthly ''statement.''

85
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:22,988
Ross: Easy!

86
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:27,159
Phoebe: And there's $500 extra in my account.

87
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:31,088
Chandler: Satan's minions at work again!

88
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:34,065
Phoebe: Now I have to go deal with them--

89
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,080
Joey: What are you talking about? Keep it!

90
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,059
Phoebe: It's not mine.

91
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,106
Phoebe: If I kept it, I'd be stealing.

92
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:44,008
Rachel: But if you spent it, it would be like shopping.

93
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,207
Phoebe: Say I bought a great pair of shoes.

94
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:53,919
Phoebe: Know what I'd hear with every step? ''Not mine. Not mine. Not mine.''

95
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:57,047
Phoebe: Even if I was happy and skipping, I'd hear:

96
00:05:57,124 --> 00:06:00,059
Phoebe: ''Not-not mine. Not-not mine.''

97
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:02,027
Monica: We're with you. We got it.

98
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,123
Phoebe: I'd never be able to enjoy it. It'd be this giant karmic debt.

99
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,158
Rachel: Chandler, what are you doing?

100
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,061
Rachel: What are you doing?

101
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:17,075
All: Oh, gross!

102
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:18,610
Ross: What is this?

103
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,043
Chandler: I'm smoking!

104
00:06:20,147 --> 00:06:22,945
Phoebe: You've been so good for three years!

105
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,042
Chandler: And this is my reward.

106
00:06:27,054 --> 00:06:30,046
Ross: Think about what you went through when you quit.

107
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:33,991
Ross: Forget about you. Think about what we went through!

108
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,154
Chandler: So this time I won't quit.

109
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,629
All: Put it out!

110
00:06:37,629 --> 00:06:39,062
Chandler: I'm putting it out!

111
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,259
Phoebe: Oh, no!

112
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:44,095
Phoebe: I can't drink this now.

113
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,099
Monica: I'm gonna go. I've got a date.

114
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,940
Rachel: With Alan again? How's it going?

115
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:57,039
Monica: It's going pretty good. It's nice and we're having fun.

116
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:59,119
Joey: When do we get to meet him?

117
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:01,121
Monica: Let's see, it's Monday....

118
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:02,136
Monica: Never.

119
00:07:02,136 --> 00:07:03,051
All: Come on!

120
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:05,148
Monica: Not after what happened with Steve.

121
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:10,123
Chandler: What do you mean? We love Steve. Steve was sexy!

122
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,122
Chandler: Sorry.

123
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:17,226
Monica: I don't know how I feel yet. Let me figure it out.

124
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:19,939
Rachel: Then can we meet him?

125
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:20,962
Monica: No.

126
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,941
Monica: Sorry.

127
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:28,138
Joey: Joey. Let it go.

128
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:33,144
Why should they meet him?

129
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:40,151
I bring a guy home and they're like coyotes picking off the weak members of the herd.

131
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:49,197
Listen, as someone who's seen more than her share of bad beef I'll tell you, that is not such a terrible thing.

133
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,097
Your friends are just looking after you.

134
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:55,903
I wish that once I'd date a guy they liked.

135
00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:01,528
You realize the odds of that happening are slimmer if they never get to meet the guy.

137
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:03,109
Ross: I know.

138
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,050
Can't I whimper a little bit?

139
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,950
Whimper.

140
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,219
Okay, I'm done.

141
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:13,049
Let it go, Ross.

142
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,927
Ross: You didn't know Chi-Chi.

143
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,099
Monica: Do you all promise?

144
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:22,231
Monica: We promise.

145
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,959
All: We'll be good.

146
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:27,131
Monica: Chandler, do you promise to be good?

147
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:39,044
Joey: You can come in, but your filter-tip buddy stays outside!

148
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:51,959
Phoebe: ''Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling.

149
00:08:52,065 --> 00:09:04,906
Phoebe: We've credited you $500. We're sorry for the inconvenience and hope you'll accept this football phone as our gift.'' Do you believe it?

152
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:08,005
Phoebe: Now I have $1000 and a football phone.

153
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,908
Rachel: What bank is this?

154
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,113
Monica: Okay, it's him.

155
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:17,947
Monica: -Who is it?
-Alan.

156
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,925
Joey: Chandler! He's here!

157
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:23,952
Do I look okay?

158
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,023
One more button.

159
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:28,067
Closed! How about closed?

160
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:30,103
I didn't know.

161
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,070
Yeah.

162
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,139
Monica: Please be good.

163
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:37,143
Monica: Remember how much you all like me?

164
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:43,143
Monica: Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.

165
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,181
Alan: I've heard so much about all you guys.

166
00:09:57,164 --> 00:10:00,065
Monica: I'll call you tomorrow. Thanks.

167
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:07,064
Monica: Let's let the Alan-bashing begin.

168
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:10,007
Monica: Who's gonna take the first shot?

169
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:12,102
Monica: Come on!

170
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,081
Ross: I'll go.

171
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,210
Ross: Let's start with how he kept picking--

172
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,080
Ross: I'm sorry, I can't do this. We loved him.

173
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,124
All: We loved him!

174
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:29,094
Monica: Wait! We're talking about someone I'm going out with?

175
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:30,993
That pimento trick!

176
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:34,124
I'll never look at an olive the same way again.

177
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,099
Rachel: And did you notice?

178
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:44,110
Joey: Know what was great? His smile was crooked.

179
00:10:44,211 --> 00:10:46,207
Phoebe: Yes! Like the man in the shoe!

180
00:10:46,207 --> 00:10:48,203
Ross: What shoe?

181
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,108
Phoebe: From the rhyme.

182
00:10:51,218 --> 00:10:53,083
Phoebe: There was a man With a crooked smile

183
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,987
Phoebe: Who lived in a shoe For a while

184
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:06,056
Ross: So I think Alan is the yardstick by which future boyfriends will be measured.

186
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,155
Rachel: Future boyfriends?

187
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,515
Rachel: I think this could be ''it.''

188
00:11:09,515 --> 00:11:11,062
Monica: Really?

189
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:15,063
Chandler: I'd marry him for his David Hasselhoff impression alone.

190
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:18,077
Chandler: You know I'll be doing that at parties.

191
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:23,045
Ross: Know what I like most?

192
00:11:23,045 --> 00:11:24,108
All: What?

193
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:28,179
Ross: The way he makes me feel about myself.

194
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,234
Monica: How was the game?

195
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,071
Ross: Well....

196
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:57,048
We won!

197
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,953
Monica: Fantastic! Question. How is that possible?

198
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:03,001
Joey: Alan.

199
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:04,047
Ross: He was unbelievable!

200
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,992
Ross: Like the cartoon where Bugs Bunny plays every position.

201
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:12,157
Ross: It was first base, Alan. Second base, Alan....

202
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,199
Rachel: It was like he made us into a team.

203
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:23,966
Chandler: We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers a thing or two about softball.

204
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,273
Monica: Can I ask a question?

205
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,106
Monica: Do you think Alan is sometimes....

206
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,171
Ross: What?

207
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:33,116
Monica: I don't know. A little too ''Alan''?

208
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:37,088
Rachel: Oh, no. Not possible. You can never be too ''Alan.''

209
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:42,083
Ross: It's his innate ''Alan-ness'' that we adore.

210
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:45,120
Chandler: I, personally, could have a gallon of Alan.

211
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:54,019
Phoebe: Hey, Lizzy.

212
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:55,065
Lizzie: Hey, weird girl.

213
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,088
Phoebe: I brought alphabet soup.

214
00:12:57,088 --> 00:12:58,134
Lizzie: Pick out the vowels?

215
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,937
Phoebe: I left in the Y's. Because, ''sometimes Y.''

216
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:04,095
Phoebe: And something else.

217
00:13:04,095 --> 00:13:05,141
Lizzie: Saltines?

218
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:07,982
Phoebe: No, $1000 and a football phone.

219
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:09,979
Lizzie: What?

220
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,183
Lizzie: Oh, my God!

221
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,090
Lizzie: There's really money in here.

222
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,187
Phoebe: I know.

223
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:17,156
Lizzie: What are you doing?

224
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,092
Phoebe: I want you to have it. I don't want it.

225
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:22,697
Lizzie: I have to give you something.

226
00:13:22,697 --> 00:13:24,193
Lizzie: No, you don't--

227
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:26,586
Lizzie: Do you want my tinfoil hat?

228
00:13:26,586 --> 00:13:28,167
Phoebe: No, you need that.

229
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:29,725
Phoebe: It's okay. Thanks.

230
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,175
Lizzie: Let me do something.

231
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:37,006
Phoebe: I'll tell you what. Buy me a soda and we're even. Okay?

232
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:38,615
Lizzie: Okay.

233
00:13:38,615 --> 00:13:39,212
Lizzie: Okay.

234
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,072
Lizzie: Keep the change.

235
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:44,105
Thanks, Lizzy.

236
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:45,208
Lizzie: Want a pretzel?

237
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,503
Phoebe: No, I'm fine. Thanks.

238
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:48,987
Lizzie: See you.

239
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:59,022
Ross: A thumb?

240
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:07,036
Phoebe: I know. There it was, just floating like this tiny little hitchhiker.

242
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:12,034
Chandler: Maybe it's a contest. Like ''collect all five.''

243
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,563
Phoebe: Does anyone wanna see?

244
00:15:14,563 --> 00:15:16,047
All: No, thanks!

245
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,177
All: Don't do that. Come on!

246
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:22,148
Rachel: It's worse than the thumb.

247
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:25,054
Chandler: This is so unfair.

248
00:15:25,054 --> 00:15:26,151
Monica: Why is it unfair?

249
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,155
Chandler: So I have a flaw! Big deal!

250
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:32,158
Joey: Joey's knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?

251
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:34,962
Ross, over-pronouncing every word.

252
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:40,200
Monica, who snorts when she laughs. I mean, what the hell is that thing?

253
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:46,008
I accept those flaws. Why can't you accept me for this?

254
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:56,044
Joey: Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody, or just him?

255
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,959
Rachel: I could live without it.

256
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:08,958
Joey: Is it a little annoying? Or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?

257
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:14,129
Ross: Don't listen to him. I think it's endearing.

258
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:16,966
Joey: Oh, you do, do you?

259
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:26,075
Ross: There's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.

260
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:29,085
Rachel: Indeed there isn't.

261
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,057
Rachel: I should get back to work.

262
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:37,061
Phoebe: Otherwise someone might get what they ordered.

263
00:16:39,099 --> 00:16:43,092
Rachel: The hair comes out and the gloves come off.

264
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:01,109
Monica: Ever go out with a guy your friends really like?

265
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:03,054
Paula: No.

266
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:08,956
Monica: I'm going out with a guy my friends really like.

267
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,020
Paula: Are we talking about the coyotes here?

268
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:16,034
Paula: All right! A cow got through.

269
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,028
Monica: Can you believe it?

270
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:20,003
Monica: It's just, you know what?

271
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:23,008
Monica: I just don't feel the ''thing.''

272
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:25,943
Monica: They feel the thing. I don't feel it.

273
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:30,982
Paula: Honey, you should always feel the thing.

274
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:36,986
Paula: If that's how you feel about the guy, dump him.

275
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,620
Monica: It's gonna be really hard.

276
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,184
Paula: He'll get over it.

277
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,954
Monica: No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.

278
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,061
Joey: Don't you respect your body?

279
00:17:48,061 --> 00:17:50,057
Ross: Don't you see what you're doing?

280
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:54,038
Chandler: I've had it with your cancer, emphysema and heart disease.

281
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:58,901
Chandler: The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.

282
00:18:02,115 --> 00:18:04,049
Rachel: Alan wants to speak to you.

283
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,142
Chandler: Really? He does?

284
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:10,054
Chandler: Hey, buddy! What's up?

285
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:13,916
Chandler: She told you about that, huh?

286
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,927
Chandler: Well, yeah. I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now.

287
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,161
Chandler: It's not that--

288
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,137
Chandler: Well, that's true.

289
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:31,968
Chandler: Gee, you know, no one's ever put it like that before.

290
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:34,945
Chandler: Well, okay. Thanks.

291
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,954
Rachel: God, he's good.

292
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,111
Ross: If only he were a woman.

293
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:51,062
Rachel: Yeah.

294
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:57,091
Chandler: Lamb Chop!

295
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:00,930
Chandler: How old is that sock?

296
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,101
Chandler: If I had a sock on my hand for 30 years, it'd be talking too.

297
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:11,948
Ross: I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.

298
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,638
Monica: Where's Joey?

299
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:20,148
Chandler: Joey ate my last stick of gum so I killed him.

301
00:19:21,027 --> 00:19:23,052
Chandler: Do you think that was wrong?

302
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,028
Rachel: I think he's across the hall.

303
00:19:26,028 --> 00:19:27,125
Monica: Thanks.

304
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,025
Ross: There you go.

305
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:33,128
Chandler: I'm alive with pleasure now.

306
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,074
Ross: Pheebs, do you want the rest of that Pop-Tart?

307
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,146
Phoebe: Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?

308
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,950
Ross: Hey, I might.

309
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:47,042
I'm sorry.

310
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:51,954
Phoebe: The soda people gave me $ 7000 for the thumb.

311
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:56,152
Phoebe: And on my way over here I stepped in gum.

312
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:59,088
Phoebe: What is up with the universe?

313
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,194
Joey: What's going on?

314
00:20:01,194 --> 00:20:03,190
Monica: It's just nice when we're together.

315
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:07,097
Joey: It's nicer when everyone gets to wear underwear.

316
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,980
Monica: Please, guys, we have to talk.

317
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,283
Phoebe: Wait! I'm getting a déjà vu.

318
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,080
Phoebe: No, I'm not.

319
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:28,489
Monica: We have to talk.

320
00:20:28,489 --> 00:20:29,985
Phoebe: There it is!

321
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:34,132
Monica: Okay, it's about Alan.

322
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,035
Speaking of which, tell him we're on for the Renaissance Fair.

323
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:43,199
Monica: Before you get into that, there's something you should know.

324
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:48,046
Monica: There's really no easy way to say this.

325
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:52,208
Monica: I've decided to break up with Alan.

326
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:58,956
Ross: Is there somebody else?

327
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:05,260
Monica: No, it's just you know, things change. People change.

329
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:08,092
Rachel: We didn't change.

330
00:21:10,203 --> 00:21:13,195
Joey: So that's it? It's over?

331
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:16,064
Joey: Just like that?

332
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:22,173
Phoebe: You let your guard down. You start to care about someone, and....

333
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:26,600
Monica: I can go on pretending--

334
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,982
Joey: Okay!

335
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:29,079
No.

336
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:32,182
Monica: That wouldn't be fair to me, Alan, or to you.

337
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:34,216
Ross: Well, who wants fair?

338
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:39,021
Ross: I just want things back, you know, the way they were.

339
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:43,064
Monica: I'm sorry.

340
00:21:43,064 --> 00:21:45,094
Chandler: Oh, she's sorry. I feel better.

341
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:48,036
Rachel: I can't believe this!

342
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:53,044
Rachel: With the holidays coming up. I wanted him to meet my family.

343
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:56,982
Monica: I'll meet someone. There'll be other Alans.

344
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,074
All: Yeah, right!

345
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:05,007
Monica: Are you guys gonna be okay?

346
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:06,958
Ross: We'll be fine.

347
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,154
Ross: We're just gonna need a little time.

348
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,188
Monica: I understand.

349
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,569
Alan: Wow.

350
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:19,968
Monica: I'm really sorry.

351
00:22:20,073 --> 00:22:23,065
Alan: Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry too.

352
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,689
Alan: But I'm a little relieved.

353
00:22:24,689 --> 00:22:26,202
Monica: Relieved?

354
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:30,176
Alan: Yeah, well, I mean, I had a great time with you.

355
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:34,019
Alan: I just can't stand your friends.

356
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:43,223
Rachel: Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?

357
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:47,190
Rachel: That was fun.

358
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:51,193
Ross: He could row like a Viking.

359
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:02,039
Ross: So how'd it go?

360
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:04,148
Monica: You know.

361
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:06,981
Phoebe: Did he mention us?

362
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:14,049
