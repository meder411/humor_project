1
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,378
Guys, there's somebody I'd like you to meet.

2
00:00:30,256 --> 00:00:31,484
Wait, wait. What is that?

3
00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:33,754
That's Marcel. Wanna say hi?

4
00:00:33,754 --> 00:00:35,250
No, I don't.

5
00:00:35,294 --> 00:00:37,376
He's cute! Where'd you get him?

6
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,458
My friend Bethel saved him from a lab.

7
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:41,358
That is so cruel.

8
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:44,461
Why would a parent name their child Bethel?

9
00:00:48,274 --> 00:00:50,469
That monkey's got a Ross on his ass.

10
00:00:55,314 --> 00:00:58,283
Is he gonna live with you in your apartment?

11
00:00:58,384 --> 00:01:01,319
Yeah. It's been kind of quiet since Carol left.

12
00:01:01,421 --> 00:01:03,355
Why not get a roommate?

13
00:01:03,423 --> 00:01:08,451
You reach a certain age, having a roommate is just kind of pathet--

14
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:15,458
That's ''pathet.'' Sanskrit for ''really cool way to live.''

15
00:02:05,318 --> 00:02:07,411
I'm doing new material tonight.

16
00:02:07,453 --> 00:02:12,356
I have 1 2 songs about my mother's suicide and one about a snowman.

17
00:02:14,393 --> 00:02:17,328
You might wanna open with the snowman.

18
00:02:18,364 --> 00:02:19,393
Hi, Joey.

19
00:02:19,393 --> 00:02:20,422
Hey, buddy.

20
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:23,230
So how'd it go?

21
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,226
I didn't get the job.

22
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:29,241
How could you not? You were Santa last year.

23
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:34,235
Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager.

24
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:38,350
He's not even jolly. It's all political.

25
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:39,914
What are you gonna be?

26
00:02:39,914 --> 00:02:41,444
One of his helpers.

27
00:02:42,255 --> 00:02:45,247
It's just such a slap in the face, you know?

28
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:48,385
Do you know what you're doing for New Year's?

29
00:02:49,495 --> 00:02:52,396
Hey, what? What is wrong with New Year's?

30
00:02:52,465 --> 00:03:01,238
You have Paolo. You don't have to face the pressure of finding lips to kiss when the ball drops!

32
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,240
Man, I'm talking loud!

33
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,244
Paolo's gonna be in Rome this New Year's.

34
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:10,310
I'll be just as pathetic as you.

35
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,306
Yeah, you wish.

36
00:03:14,253 --> 00:03:16,312
I've got an idea. Dinner.

37
00:03:16,422 --> 00:03:20,324
It's perfect. We'll put it between lunch and breakfast.

38
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:25,458
I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday.

39
00:03:26,265 --> 00:03:30,326
I say this year, we make a pact. Just the six of us. Dinner.

40
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:30,915
Sure.

41
00:03:30,915 --> 00:03:31,461
Fine.

42
00:03:32,271 --> 00:03:34,364
I was hoping for more enthusiasm.

43
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:38,389
Phoebe, you're on.

44
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:39,435
Oh, good.

45
00:03:40,246 --> 00:03:46,275
Hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand Miss Phoebe Buffay.

47
00:03:49,455 --> 00:03:51,480
Hi. Thanks. Hi.

48
00:03:52,491 --> 00:03:56,393
I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me.

49
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:05,193
I made a man with eyes of coal

50
00:04:05,304 --> 00:04:08,330
And a smile so bewitching

51
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:11,401
How was I supposed to know

52
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,441
That my mom was dead in the kitchen?

53
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,314
My mother's ashes

54
00:04:24,457 --> 00:04:27,426
Even her eyelashes

55
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:34,222
Are resting in a little yellow jar

56
00:04:36,435 --> 00:04:39,370
And sometimes when it's freezing

57
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:42,366
I feel a little sneezy

58
00:04:43,276 --> 00:04:47,440
And now I-- Excuse me? Excuse me? Yeah, noisy boys.

59
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:53,284
Is it something you'd like to share with the group?

60
00:04:54,353 --> 00:04:56,480
No. No, that's okay.

61
00:04:57,256 --> 00:05:03,286
If it's important enough while I'm playing it's important enough for everyone else.

63
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:06,229
That guy's going home with a note.

64
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:12,819
I was just saying--

65
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:14,201
Speak up.

66
00:05:14,307 --> 00:05:15,296
Sorry, I--

67
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:20,405
I was saying you were the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.

68
00:05:21,213 --> 00:05:26,410
And he said that Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen.

70
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:30,216
I said I liked her in Splash, but not Wall Street.

71
00:05:30,323 --> 00:05:33,315
I thought she had a hard quality.

72
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:41,331
While Daryl is beautiful in a conventional way you are luminous with a kind of delicate grace.

74
00:05:44,236 --> 00:05:47,228
Then that's when you started yelling.

75
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,244
We're gonna take a short break.

76
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:04,279
That guy's going home with more than a note.

77
00:06:09,295 --> 00:06:11,195
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.

78
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:18,226
I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet.

79
00:06:18,304 --> 00:06:23,207
By my sixth date with Paolo, he'd already named both my breasts.

80
00:06:26,312 --> 00:06:28,405
Did I just share too much?

81
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:31,443
Just a smidge.

82
00:06:32,418 --> 00:06:36,252
David's, like, a scientist guy. He's very methodical.

83
00:06:36,322 --> 00:06:37,334
I think it's romantic.

84
00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:38,346
Me too!

85
00:06:38,424 --> 00:06:42,258
Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?

86
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:46,229
He's kind of like the guy I went to see that with.

87
00:06:51,237 --> 00:06:55,264
Except he's smarter and gentler and sweeter.

88
00:06:55,474 --> 00:06:58,375
I just wanna be with him all the time.

89
00:06:58,477 --> 00:07:02,208
You know, day and night. And night and day.

90
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:05,182
And special occasions.

91
00:07:07,286 --> 00:07:10,278
I see. You're gonna ask him to New Year's.

92
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,385
She's gonna break the pact.

93
00:07:12,385 --> 00:07:14,381
No! No, no.

94
00:07:14,427 --> 00:07:17,191
No. Yeah, could I just--?

95
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:20,916
Yeah. I already asked Janice.

96
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,400
What?

97
00:07:22,435 --> 00:07:25,336
This was a pact! This was your pact!

98
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:28,305
I couldn't handle the pressure. I snapped!

99
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,342
But that was the worst breakup in history!

100
00:07:31,444 --> 00:07:35,244
I'm not saying it was a good idea. I snapped!

101
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:39,317
Hi, sorry I'm late.

102
00:07:47,526 --> 00:07:49,426
Too many jokes.

103
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,354
Must mock Joey.

104
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,235
Nice shoes, huh?

105
00:07:58,237 --> 00:07:59,465
God, you're killing me!

106
00:08:01,407 --> 00:08:05,173
Ross, he's playing with my spatulas again!

107
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,728
He's not gonna hurt them, right?

108
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:10,179
Do you always have to bring him?

109
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:16,220
I didn't wanna leave him alone. We had our first fight this morning.

110
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:23,191
It has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean.

111
00:08:24,497 --> 00:08:27,295
He threw some feces.

112
00:08:30,336 --> 00:08:33,328
If you're working late, I can look in on him.

113
00:08:33,439 --> 00:08:35,304
That would be great!

114
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:39,343
But make sure it seems like you're there to see him.

115
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:41,402
You're not doing it for me.

116
00:08:42,214 --> 00:08:45,206
Okay. But if he asks, I'm not going to lie.

117
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:54,256
But you can't actually test this theory.

118
00:08:54,326 --> 00:09:00,813
Today's particle accelerators aren't powerful enough to simulate these conditions.

120
00:09:00,813 --> 00:09:03,162
I have a question then.

121
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:04,299
Yeah?

122
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:05,396
Do you plan on kissing me ever?

123
00:09:09,475 --> 00:09:18,282
That's definitely a valid question, and the answer would be yes. Yes, I was.

125
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:29,318
But I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss at a phenomenal moment because it's you.

127
00:09:29,395 --> 00:09:30,384
Sure.

128
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:35,189
The longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be.

129
00:09:35,234 --> 00:09:42,330
Now, it's just gotta be one of those things where I sweep everything off the table.

131
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:45,342
And I'm not really a sweeping sort of fella.

132
00:09:45,444 --> 00:09:49,437
David, I think you are a sweeping sort of fella.

133
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:54,311
I mean, you're a sweeper trapped inside a physicist's body.

134
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:55,884
Really?

135
00:09:55,884 --> 00:09:56,447
I'm sure.

136
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:00,214
You should just do it. Just throw me.

137
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:04,375
Now?

138
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,421
Yeah, right now. Just....

139
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:07,465
Okay. Okay. Okay.

140
00:10:10,436 --> 00:10:13,337
You know what? This is really expensive.

141
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,374
And this was a gift.

142
00:10:17,443 --> 00:10:18,939
Now you're just tidying up.

143
00:10:18,939 --> 00:10:20,435
Okay.

144
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,746
You want me to throw you--?

145
00:10:26,746 --> 00:10:28,242
I can hop.

146
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,397
Tell me something, what does ''no-date pact'' mean to you?

147
00:10:48,474 --> 00:10:52,376
It's just that Chandler and Phoebe have somebody.

148
00:10:52,478 --> 00:10:54,469
I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.

149
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:55,542
Your ex-boyfriend?

150
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:56,571
Yeah.

151
00:10:57,383 --> 00:10:59,413
You know more than one Fun Bobby?

152
00:10:59,413 --> 00:11:01,443
I happen to know a Fun Bob.

153
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,889
Okay. Here we go.

154
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:08,323
There's no room for milk.

155
00:11:13,432 --> 00:11:15,457
There. Now there is.

156
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:20,365
So on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.

157
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,286
Four.

158
00:11:22,286 --> 00:11:23,332
Five.

159
00:11:24,276 --> 00:11:26,437
Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.

160
00:11:27,246 --> 00:11:30,340
And I met this really hot single mom at the store.

161
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,444
What's an elf to do?

162
00:11:33,352 --> 00:11:37,448
So I'll be the only one alone when the ball drops?

163
00:11:38,257 --> 00:11:42,284
We'll have a big party, and no one will know who's with who.

164
00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:46,354
I'll know. This is so not what I needed right now.

165
00:11:46,465 --> 00:11:47,864
What's the matter?

166
00:11:47,864 --> 00:11:49,263
Oh, it's Marcel.

167
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:56,407
He's angry with me. I have no idea why. He keeps shutting me out.

168
00:11:56,475 --> 00:12:00,309
He's walking around all the time, dragging his hands.

169
00:12:01,213 --> 00:12:04,205
That's weird. I had a blast with him.

170
00:12:04,316 --> 00:12:05,311
Really?

171
00:12:05,311 --> 00:12:06,306
We played, watched TV.

172
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,218
That juggling thing is amazing.

173
00:12:12,224 --> 00:12:14,215
What juggling thing?

174
00:12:14,426 --> 00:12:17,418
With the socks? I figured you taught him that.

175
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,421
No.

176
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:25,233
It wasn't that big a deal. Just socks. And a melon.

177
00:12:29,274 --> 00:12:30,354
Phoebe!

178
00:12:30,354 --> 00:12:31,434
Max. Do you know everybody?

179
00:12:31,477 --> 00:12:34,344
No. Have you seen David?

180
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:36,373
He hasn't been around.

181
00:12:36,482 --> 00:12:40,441
If you see him, tell him to pack. We are going to Minsk.

182
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:42,316
Minsk?

183
00:12:42,316 --> 00:12:43,379
Minsk. It's in Russia.

184
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,380
I know where Minsk is.

185
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,491
We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.

186
00:12:52,297 --> 00:12:55,391
And if you're gonna do Minsk, that's the way to go.

187
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,481
So when do you leave?

188
00:12:57,481 --> 00:12:58,561
January 1st.

189
00:13:06,445 --> 00:13:08,925
Hello?

190
00:13:08,925 --> 00:13:11,405
What? Hey. Hi.

191
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:13,781
What are you doing here?

192
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:15,345
Max told me about Minsk.

193
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,355
Congratulations! This is so exciting!

194
00:13:19,525 --> 00:13:22,460
It'd be even more exciting if we were going.

195
00:13:23,228 --> 00:13:25,423
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?

196
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:32,362
Tell her. ''I don't wanna go to work with Lipson, Yamaguchi and Flank.

198
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,531
I wanna stay and make out with my girlfriend!''

199
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:38,436
Okay, thank you, Max. Thank you.

200
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,247
So you're really not going?

201
00:13:42,347 --> 00:13:45,339
I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just....

202
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,351
How can I leave you? I just found you.

203
00:13:48,387 --> 00:13:52,255
Oh, David. But what are you gonna do?

204
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:56,452
I don't know. You decide.

205
00:13:57,262 --> 00:13:58,377
Don't do that.

206
00:13:58,377 --> 00:13:59,492
But I'm asking you.

207
00:14:00,232 --> 00:14:01,813
I can't make a decision. Just--

208
00:14:01,813 --> 00:14:03,394
Okay. Stay.

209
00:14:06,205 --> 00:14:06,751
Stay.

210
00:14:06,751 --> 00:14:07,297
Stay.

211
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:17,407
Getting so good at that!

212
00:14:19,218 --> 00:14:21,243
It was Max's stuff.

213
00:14:29,228 --> 00:14:31,458
I love this artichoke thing.

214
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:35,359
Don't tell me what's in it. The diet starts tomorrow.

215
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:42,332
You remember Janice.

216
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:45,242
Vividly.

217
00:14:45,444 --> 00:14:47,395
How are you?

218
00:14:47,395 --> 00:14:49,346
I am fantastic.

219
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:50,370
Now.

220
00:14:52,284 --> 00:14:57,420
It's amazing. We've been back together for what like 10 minutes, and--

222
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,552
Is that all?

223
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:02,283
It's like we were never apart.

224
00:15:02,394 --> 00:15:06,194
Of course, we were, but-- Forgive and forget.

225
00:15:06,298 --> 00:15:08,391
Well, forget.

226
00:15:19,344 --> 00:15:19,890
Hi.

227
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,436
Hi, I'm Sandy.

228
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:23,306
Sandy, hi. Come on in.

229
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:35,338
You brought your kids.

230
00:15:35,338 --> 00:15:37,351
Yeah. That's okay, right?

231
00:15:39,431 --> 00:15:41,831
Party!

232
00:15:41,831 --> 00:15:44,231
That thing is not coming in here!

233
00:15:44,336 --> 00:15:46,429
This is how you greet guests?

234
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:51,369
If I showed up with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome?

235
00:15:52,277 --> 00:15:56,270
Your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.

236
00:15:56,348 --> 00:15:59,442
He was more embarrassed about that than anyone.

237
00:16:01,386 --> 00:16:07,384
And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened--

239
00:16:08,393 --> 00:16:11,419
All right. All right. Just keep him away from me.

240
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,289
Thank you. Come on, Marcel.

241
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:17,297
What do you say you and I mingle?

242
00:16:18,337 --> 00:16:22,433
All right, I'll catch up with you later.

243
00:16:28,246 --> 00:16:33,206
Oh, my gosh! Rachel, honey, are you okay?

244
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:35,786
Where's Paolo?

245
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,254
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.

246
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:40,448
And then your face exploded?

247
00:16:42,327 --> 00:16:43,351
No.

248
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:57,434
Okay. I was at the airport getting into a cab when this woman, this blond planet with a pocketbook starts yelling. Something about how it was her cab first.

251
00:16:57,476 --> 00:17:01,412
The next thing, she just starts pulling me out by my hair!

252
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:07,377
And I was blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up.

254
00:17:08,186 --> 00:17:12,384
So as I'm going to get into a cab, she tackles me!

255
00:17:13,191 --> 00:17:18,219
And I hit my head on the curb and cut my lip on my whistle.

256
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,293
Everybody having fun at the party?

257
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:27,771
Are people eating my dip?

258
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:29,204
Yes.

259
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,405
There.

260
00:17:36,314 --> 00:17:38,327
That looks okay, right?

261
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:40,340
You went a bit wide on the lipstick.

262
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:41,835
Oh, I did?

263
00:17:41,835 --> 00:17:43,251
Yeah.

264
00:17:43,321 --> 00:17:47,223
It's hard for me to tell. My eye's closing up.

265
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:49,260
Let me get it for you.

266
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:50,891
Ow!

267
00:17:50,891 --> 00:17:51,420
Okay.

268
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,255
You know what? It looks fine.

269
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:57,264
Okay, here we go.

270
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:01,305
Screw Paolo, screw the psycho cab lady.

271
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:04,375
It's New Year's Eve. Let's have a good time.

272
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:05,359
Okay, here we go.

273
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:06,309
Okay.

274
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:09,370
All right, there you go. This way.

275
00:18:10,482 --> 00:18:12,313
Here you go.

276
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:23,321
When I saw you at the store last week it was the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.

278
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,409
Wow, that's dirty.

279
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:29,388
Yeah.

280
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:34,498
Hey, kids.

281
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:42,246
He doesn't have to spend the whole evening with me but at least check in.

283
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:45,349
There you are!

284
00:18:47,219 --> 00:18:49,414
You got away from me.

285
00:18:50,222 --> 00:18:52,218
But you found me.

286
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:54,214
Here, Ross, take our picture.

287
00:18:54,326 --> 00:18:57,420
Smile. You're on Janice Camera.

288
00:18:58,363 --> 00:19:00,194
IKill me. IKill me now.

289
00:19:05,203 --> 00:19:07,467
Hi, I'm Rachel.

290
00:19:08,206 --> 00:19:10,299
So whose friend are you?

291
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:17,307
Look at me, spilling everywhere.

292
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:21,218
Everybody, it's Fun Bobby!

293
00:19:24,322 --> 00:19:29,488
Hey, sorry I'm late. But my grandfather died about two hours ago.

295
00:19:30,228 --> 00:19:35,427
But I couldn't get a flight out till tomorrow, so here I am.

296
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:41,432
Hey, Fun Bobby! How's it going, man? Whoa! Who died?

297
00:19:46,211 --> 00:19:48,509
It's gonna be an open casket, you know?

298
00:19:50,215 --> 00:19:52,513
So at least I'll get to see him again.

299
00:19:57,222 --> 00:20:00,316
Bobby? Fun Bobby?

300
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,419
Let me talk to you for just a sec.

301
00:20:04,262 --> 00:20:09,466
I recently lost a grandparent myself so I really know exactly how you feel.

303
00:20:10,268 --> 00:20:13,237
But you're really bringing the party down.

304
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:15,385
I'm sorry.

305
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:16,431
Yeah, yeah, okay.

306
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:19,533
There you go. There you go.

307
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:26,239
I'm gonna blow this one up and write ''Reunited'' in glitter.

308
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,285
All right, Janice, that's it!

309
00:20:28,386 --> 00:20:31,253
Janice. Janice.

310
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:36,259
Hey, Janice, when I invited you, I didn't think it meant--

311
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,386
Oh, no!

312
00:20:42,467 --> 00:20:45,265
I'm sorry you misunderstood.

313
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,395
You listen to me! You listen to me!

314
00:20:47,505 --> 00:20:52,408
One of these times, it's just gonna be your last chance with me!

315
00:20:54,412 --> 00:20:56,380
Will you give me the thing?

316
00:21:00,252 --> 00:21:01,298
Hi, Max.

317
00:21:01,298 --> 00:21:02,344
Yoko.

318
00:21:07,425 --> 00:21:10,451
I've decided to go to Minsk without you.

319
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,327
Wow.

320
00:21:13,327 --> 00:21:19,267
It won't be the same...but it will still be Minsk. Happy New Year.

322
00:21:20,472 --> 00:21:22,423
Are you all right?

323
00:21:22,423 --> 00:21:24,374
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

324
00:21:29,547 --> 00:21:31,344
Come on.

325
00:21:33,385 --> 00:21:35,415
You're going to Minsk.

326
00:21:35,415 --> 00:21:37,445
No, I'm not going to Minsk.

327
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:39,450
You are so going to Minsk.

328
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:43,450
You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just for me.

329
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:46,457
If I go, I have to break up with you.

330
00:21:46,564 --> 00:21:48,031
And I can't break up with you.

331
00:21:48,031 --> 00:21:49,498
Yes, you can.

332
00:21:50,302 --> 00:21:54,398
Just say, ''Phoebe, I love you, but my work is my life.

333
00:21:54,472 --> 00:21:56,372
That's what I have to do.''

334
00:21:56,474 --> 00:22:00,308
And I say, ''Your work? How can you say that?''

335
00:22:01,413 --> 00:22:06,441
Then you say, ''I have no choice. Can't you understand that?''

336
00:22:07,218 --> 00:22:11,211
And I say, ''No! No! I can't understand that!''

337
00:22:11,323 --> 00:22:11,886
Ow.

338
00:22:11,886 --> 00:22:12,449
Sorry.

339
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:17,328
And then you put your arms around me.

340
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:19,329
Then you put your arms around me.

341
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:21,229
Oh, sorry.

342
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:26,335
And then you tell me you love me and you'll never forget me.

343
00:22:26,438 --> 00:22:28,463
I'll never forget you.

344
00:22:30,342 --> 00:22:38,238
Then you say that you have to go because you don't wanna start the year with me if you can't finish it.

346
00:22:44,356 --> 00:22:47,553
I'm gonna miss you, you scientist guy.

347
00:22:50,362 --> 00:22:52,353
Hi, Dick Clark in Times Square.

348
00:22:52,464 --> 00:22:57,367
We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square.

349
00:22:57,469 --> 00:22:59,369
It gets better every....

350
00:22:59,471 --> 00:23:01,405
Here you go, kids.

351
00:23:02,207 --> 00:23:04,402
And then the peacock bit me.

352
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,310
Please kiss me at midnight!

353
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:14,317
You seen Sandy?

354
00:23:14,317 --> 00:23:20,348
I don't know how to tell you this but she's in the bedroom getting it on with Max.

356
00:23:20,425 --> 00:23:23,223
Oh, I did know how to tell you.

357
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:25,893
Hey, everybody, the ball is dropping.

358
00:23:25,893 --> 00:23:27,457
What?

359
00:23:28,466 --> 00:23:31,458
The ball is dropping!

360
00:23:33,338 --> 00:23:35,465
In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.

361
00:23:36,241 --> 00:23:38,436
And the moment of joy is upon us.

362
00:23:39,344 --> 00:23:42,279
Looks like that no-date pact worked out.

363
00:23:42,447 --> 00:23:45,280
Everybody looks so happy. I hate that!

364
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,443
Not everybody is happy. Hey, Bobby!

365
00:23:47,485 --> 00:23:53,390
--four, three, two one! Happy New Year!

367
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:04,234
I thought I'd throw this out. I'm no math whiz but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.

369
00:24:05,303 --> 00:24:08,238
I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.

370
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:10,290
I can't kiss anyone.

371
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,241
So, I'm kissing everyone?

372
00:24:13,211 --> 00:24:16,237
No, you can't kiss Ross. That's your brother.

373
00:24:16,314 --> 00:24:18,509
So now everybody's getting kissed but me.

374
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,308
Somebody kiss me.

375
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:24,320
Somebody kiss me! It's midnight! Somebody kiss me!

376
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:26,356
All right! All right!

377
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:28,350
There!

378
00:24:35,233 --> 00:24:37,360
I wanted this to work so much.

379
00:24:38,336 --> 00:24:40,236
I'm still in there.

00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:43,263

It's hard that something you love so much doesn't love you back.

383
00:24:53,351 --> 00:24:56,377
I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
