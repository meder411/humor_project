1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:16,272
Terry, I know I haven't worked here very long but would it be possible if I got a $100 advance on my salary?

3
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:18,246
An advance?

4
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:21,286
So I can spend Thanksgiving with my family.

5
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:25,381
Every year we ski in Vail, and my father pays for my ticket.

6
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:32,254
But I've started this independent thing which is actually why I took this ''job.''

8
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:36,367
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart!

9
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:39,464
You're a terrible, terrible waitress.

10
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:43,274
Really, really awful.

11
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:47,503
I hear what you're saying. I'm with you.

12
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:54,283
But I'm trying really hard, and I think I'm doing better.

13
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,412
I really do.

14
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,985
Does anybody need coffee?

15
00:00:57,985 --> 00:00:59,481
Yeah, over here.

16
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,287
Look at that.

17
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,476
Excuse me, sir? Hi. You come in here all the time.

18
00:01:56,516 --> 00:02:02,216
Do you think there's a possibility that you could advance me my tips?

19
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:08,353
Okay, okay. That's fine. Fine. Sorry about that spill before!

20
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,420
Only 98.50 to go!

21
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:17,464
Did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?

22
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,250
What? No, they're not.

23
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,229
Yes, the Blymans invited them.

24
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:23,468
You're wrong.

25
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,360
I am not wrong.

26
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,243
You're wrong.

27
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,349
No, I just talked to them.

28
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,243
I'm calling Mom.

29
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:39,420
Hey, hey.

30
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,449
Hey!

31
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:47,255
And this from the Cry for Help Department: Are you wearing makeup?

32
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:54,397
Yes, I am. As of today, I'm officially Joey Tribbiani, actor/model.

33
00:02:54,507 --> 00:03:00,309
That's funny. I was thinking you look more like, Joey Tribbiani, man/woman.

34
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,282
What were you modeling for?

35
00:03:03,282 --> 00:03:05,250
Posters for the free clinic.

36
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:09,219
So you're gonna be one of those healthy guys?

37
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,251
The asthma guy's really cute.

38
00:03:11,251 --> 00:03:13,247
Know which one you'll be?

39
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,352
No, but I hear Lyme disease is open, so you know....

40
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,347
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.

41
00:03:19,347 --> 00:03:21,264
Thanks.

42
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:29,231
You were right. How can they do this? It's Thanksgiving!

43
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:33,439
What if I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.

44
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:37,273
Will you make mashed potatoes with the lumps?

45
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:42,352
They're not actually supposed to-- I'll work on the lumps.

46
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,284
Joey, you're going home?

47
00:03:44,284 --> 00:03:45,279
Yeah.

48
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:49,454
Chandler, you're still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays?

49
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,444
Every single one of them.

50
00:03:52,444 --> 00:03:54,492
Phoebe, you'll be with your grandma?

51
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,360
And her boyfriend.

52
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:00,496
We're celebrating Thanksgiving in December because he's lunar.

53
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,304
So you're free Thursday then?

54
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,393
Yeah. Oh, can I come?

55
00:04:08,393 --> 00:04:09,439
Yeah.

56
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,882
Rach, are you gonna make it to Vail?

57
00:04:13,882 --> 00:04:16,413
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop.

58
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:18,821
Only $102 to go.

59
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:20,419
I thought it was 98.50?

60
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,419
Yeah, well, it was, but I-- I broke a cup, so....

61
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,313
Well, I'm off to Carol's.

62
00:04:27,313 --> 00:04:29,361
Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?

63
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:38,242
Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife and will want to bring her ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.

65
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,244
Hi. Is Carol here?

66
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,920
No, she's at a faculty meeting.

67
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,485
I just came by to pick up my skull.

68
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:58,287
Well, not mine, but....

69
00:04:58,498 --> 00:04:59,413
Come in.

70
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:00,328
Thanks.

71
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,427
Carol borrowed it, and I have to get it back to the museum.

72
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,718
What's it look like?

73
00:05:07,718 --> 00:05:10,198
Kind of like a big face without skin.

74
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:15,244
Yes. I'm familiar with the concept.

75
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,781
We can just look for it.

76
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:18,214
Okay.

77
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:28,353
Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about being a lesbian.

78
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,428
Well, you know, you have to take a course.

79
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,328
Otherwise they don't let you do it.

80
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:50,443
Hey, Yertle the Turtle! A classic.

81
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,447
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.

82
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:59,247
The baby that hasn't been born yet?

83
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,294
Wouldn't that mean you're crazy?

84
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,290
You don't think they can hear sounds in there?

85
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,393
You're not serious? I mean, you really talk to it?

86
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:16,402
Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice.

87
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:24,213
Well, that's just-- Do you talk about me?

88
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,365
Yeah. All the time.

89
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:28,213
Really?

90
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:33,418
But, we just refer to you as ''Bobo the Sperm Guy.''

91
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,367
If she's talking to it, I just think I should get some belly time too.

92
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,433
Not that I believe this.

93
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:55,379
I believe it. I think the baby can hear everything.

94
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,915
Really?

95
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:58,382
I'll show you. This'll seem weird.

96
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:06,280
But you put your head inside this turkey and we'll all talk and you'll hear everything we say.

98
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:12,195
I'd just like to say I'm totally behind this experiment.

99
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:16,234
In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.

100
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:20,771
Hey.

101
00:07:20,771 --> 00:07:22,204
Rach, did you make your money?

102
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:26,244
No, not even close. Forget Vail. Forget seeing my family.

103
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:30,213
Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.

104
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,352
Rach, here's your mail.

105
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:37,253
Thanks. You can put it on the table.

106
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:41,225
No. Here's your mail!

107
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,454
Thanks. You can put it on the table!

108
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,257
Would you just open it!

109
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:55,466
Oh, my God! You guys are great!

110
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,335
We all chipped in.

111
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,776
We did?

112
00:07:59,776 --> 00:08:01,175
You owe me $20.

113
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,407
Thank you. Thank you so much!

114
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:12,214
Chandler, got your traditional holiday feast. Tomato soup grilled-cheese fixings and a family-size bag of Funyuns.

116
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:17,422
This is your Thanksgiving dinner? What is it with you and this holiday?

117
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,711
I'm 9 years old.

118
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:22,224
I hate this story!

119
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:29,197
We've finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have a mouthful of pumpkin pie.

121
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:33,210
And then my parents tell me they're getting divorced.

122
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,336
Oh, my God!

123
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:40,215
Very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.

124
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:46,357
What's this? I never saw this at Mom's.

125
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,909
It's a yam.

126
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:49,359
Hello....

127
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:55,426
This isn't a yam. Yam comes in purple cans.

128
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:59,261
They don't-- They don't come in these.

129
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:04,273
Ross, don't take this the wrong way or anything, but back off.

130
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,316
Hi.

131
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,843
We used to work together.

132
00:09:21,843 --> 00:09:23,293
We did?

133
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:27,230
Yeah, at Macy's. You're the Obsession girl, right?

134
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,796
Yes.

135
00:09:28,796 --> 00:09:30,292
I was the Aramis guy.

136
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,801
Aramis. Aramis. Aramis.

137
00:09:33,801 --> 00:09:36,298
Yeah, right!

138
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,790
You're the best in the business.

139
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,337
Get out.

140
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:45,406
You're amazing! You know when to spritz. You know when to lay back.

141
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:49,449
Really? You don't know what that means to me.

142
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:56,427
You smell great tonight. What are you wearing?

143
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,327
Nothing.

144
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,341
Listen, do you wanna go get a drink?

145
00:10:10,341 --> 00:10:13,242
Yeah, that would be--

146
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,911
What's wrong?

147
00:10:15,911 --> 00:10:17,475
I have to do something.

148
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,376
What?

149
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,505
Leave.

150
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:25,456
Wait, wait, wait!

151
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,326
So I guess you all saw it.

152
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:10,982
What?

153
00:11:10,982 --> 00:11:11,528
Saw what?

154
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:16,469
No, we're just laughing. You know how laughter can be infectious.

155
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:40,489
Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.

156
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,269
''Tonight, on a very special Blossom. ''

157
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,506
Looking good! Okay!

158
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:59,479
Cider's mulling, turkey's turkeying, yams are yamming....

159
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,412
What?

160
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:06,357
I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.

161
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,257
Get out and stop annoying me!

162
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,262
Oh, that's closer.

163
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,331
I got the tickets!

164
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:18,426
Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop!

165
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,937
Oh, you must stop shooping.

166
00:12:20,937 --> 00:12:23,337
Okay, I'm gonna get my stuff.

167
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,239
Will you come in?

168
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:29,371
I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.

169
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:33,350
Look out! Incoming pumpkin pie!

170
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:44,361
We laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny.

171
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:49,360
Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any Tator Tots.

172
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,835
That's not a question.

173
00:12:51,835 --> 00:12:54,269
My mom makes them. It's a tradition.

174
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:59,470
You get a piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce and a Tot!

175
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:06,308
I mean, it's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.

176
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,216
All right. Fine.

177
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:15,260
Tonight's potatoes will be mashed, with lumps and in the form of Tots.

178
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:20,357
All right, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.

179
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,327
Okay, Mom never hit.

180
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,433
Okay, all done.

181
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:35,470
Phoebe, did you whip the pota--? Ross needs lumps!

182
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,442
Oh, I'm sorry! I just--

183
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:43,278
I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.

184
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,447
Why do that?

185
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:50,285
Because then they'd be just like my mom used to make it, before she died.

186
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,456
Okay. Three kinds of potatoes coming up.

187
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,397
Okay. Goodbye, you guys! Thanks for everything!

188
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:05,200
Oh, God, look at-- Sorry! I'm so sorry.

189
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:10,204
An unbelievable thing happened! Underdog got away!

190
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,381
The balloon?

191
00:14:12,381 --> 00:14:14,446
No, no, the actual cartoon character.

192
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:18,222
Of course the balloon!

193
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:23,227
He broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park.

194
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,860
I'm going to the roof. Who's with me?

195
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,458
I can't!

196
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:31,226
An 80-foot dog over the city? How often does that happen?

197
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,429
Almost never.

198
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,835
Got the keys?

199
00:14:34,835 --> 00:14:36,331
Okay.

200
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,339
Anytime you're ready.

201
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:47,250
Okay. Okay, here we go.

202
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:55,288
Okay. Where am I talking to here?

203
00:14:56,262 --> 00:15:00,426
There is one way that offers a certain acoustical advantage, but....

204
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,198
Just aim for the bump.

205
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,427
Okay.

206
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:10,240
Okay. Okay. Okay, here goes.

207
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:21,308
You know, I can't do this. This is--

208
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:24,322
It's too weird. I feel stupid.

209
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:29,258
It's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it.

210
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:33,320
Hello, baby. Hello. Hello.

211
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:38,327
--the moment we first saw the dog shadow fall over the park!

212
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,363
But did they have to shoot him down? That was just mean.

213
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:49,439
Right now the turkey should be crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.

215
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,476
Why are we standing here?

216
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:56,243
We're waiting for you to open the door. You have the keys.

217
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,481
No, I don't.

218
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,324
Yes, you do. When we left, you said, ''Got the keys.''

219
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:07,289
No, I didn't. I asked, ''Got the keys?''

220
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:11,293
No, no, no. You said, ''Got the keys!''

221
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:14,431
Do either of you have the keys?

222
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:16,903
The oven is on!

223
00:16:16,903 --> 00:16:18,399
I've gotta get my ticket!

224
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:19,940
Wait! We have a copy of your key.

225
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,436
Get it!

226
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,512
That tone won't make me go any faster.

227
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,279
Joey.

228
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:27,308
That one will.

229
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:35,215
And everyone's telling me, ''You gotta pick a major.''

230
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,458
So on a dare, I picked paleontology.

231
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:45,363
And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, face it, you're a fetus.

232
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:49,464
You're happy you don't have gills anymore.

233
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:54,268
You don't have to talk to it. You can sing--

234
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:58,248
Please. I am not singing to your stomach, okay?

235
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,284
How's it going?

236
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,286
Here we come

237
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,379
Walking down the street

238
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,421
Get the funniest looks from Everyone we meet

239
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,388
Hey, hey--

240
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,816
Hey, did you just feel that?

241
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:16,300
I did.

242
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:17,852
Does it always--?

243
00:17:17,852 --> 00:17:19,302
That was the first.

244
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,396
Keep singing! Keep singing!

245
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:26,241
Hey, hey, you're my baby And I can't wait to meet you

246
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:30,441
When you come out I'll buy you a bagel Then we'll go to the zoo

247
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,330
It did it again!

248
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,410
I felt it that time!

249
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:38,354
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy I'm the one without any breasts

250
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:46,424
This is great. It's 5:00. My plane is pulling away from the gate.

251
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,779
Maybe you can take a later flight.

252
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:50,326
There is none.

253
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,370
You can go tomorrow.

254
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,304
Tomorrow is not Thanksgiving!

255
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:58,366
If I'm gonna cheer you up, you have to meet me halfway.

256
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,242
Can you go any faster?

257
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,373
I got one keyhole and a zillion keys! You do the math.

258
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:09,285
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?

259
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,186
For an emergency just like this.

260
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,291
All right. Listen, smirky!

261
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:23,290
If not for your stupid balloon, I'd be on a plane watching a woman do this...right now. But I'm not!

263
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,337
You said you had the keys!

264
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:31,308
No, I didn't! I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys!

265
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:35,336
That's it! Enough with the keys. No one say keys!

266
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,317
Why would I have the keys?!

267
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,882
Aside from the fact you said you did?

268
00:18:41,882 --> 00:18:43,412
I didn't!

269
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:44,769
You should've.

270
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:45,315
Why?

271
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:45,851
Because!

272
00:18:45,851 --> 00:18:46,345
Why?

273
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:51,362
Everything's my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making dinner?

274
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:55,457
Everyone wants a different kind of potato, so I'm making them.

275
00:18:56,268 --> 00:19:01,171
Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? No!

276
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,173
No! No!

277
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:08,269
Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his Tots--

278
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:12,306
It's my first Thanksgiving, and I--

279
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:15,409
It's all burnt, and I can't....

280
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:23,192
Monica, only dogs can hear you now. Look, the door's open. Here we go.

281
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,717
All right, Chandler, don't lose this.

282
00:19:29,717 --> 00:19:31,201
No--

283
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,199
Well, the turkey's burnt!

284
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,406
Potatoes are ruined! Potatoes are ruined! Potatoes are ruined!

285
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,216
Here we come

286
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,251
Walking down the--

287
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,448
This doesn't smell like Mom's.

288
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:59,263
It doesn't, does it? You wanted lumps? Here you go, buddy. You got one!

289
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,945
Don't yell at me. You burned dinner!

290
00:20:01,945 --> 00:20:04,459
Hey, don't make her squeak again!

291
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:10,535
God, this is great! The plane is gone. I guess I'm stuck here with you guys.

292
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:15,269
We all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice!

293
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:20,374
Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious dinner?

294
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,015
You call that delicious?

295
00:20:22,015 --> 00:20:23,545
You be quiet!

296
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,257
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

297
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:31,262
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.

298
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:38,496
Skiing.

299
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:43,407
Shoop, shoop, shoop....

300
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,373
Shoop.

301
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:47,876
Eww.

302
00:20:47,876 --> 00:20:48,473
What?

303
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:52,512
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven.

304
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,999
Who cares?

305
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:56,580
He just sat in gravy.

306
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,416
Oh, my God! He's not alone.

307
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:07,424
Ugly Naked Guy is having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.

308
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,426
I gotta see this!

309
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,329
All right, Ugly Naked Guy!

310
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,368
Ugly naked dancing!

311
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,437
It's nice that he has someone.

312
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,356
Shall I carve?

313
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,488
By all means.

314
00:21:35,488 --> 00:21:36,483
All right.

315
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:45,395
Who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?

316
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:49,372
I don't even want to know about the dark cheese.

317
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,890
Does anybody wanna split this?

318
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,306
I will.

319
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:53,941
You guys have to make a wish.

320
00:21:53,941 --> 00:21:55,505
Make a wish?

321
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,476
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.

322
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:06,322
You got the bigger half! What did you wish for?

323
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,416
The bigger half.

324
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:13,330
All right, I'd like to propose a toast.

325
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,526
A little toast here. Ding, ding!

326
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:23,230
This isn't the Thanksgiving you planned but for me, this has been really great.

328
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:29,281
I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.

329
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:43,284
If you'd gone to Vail or if you had been with your family or if you didn't have syphilis and stuff...we wouldn't be together.

332
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:51,302
I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.

334
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,817
That's so sweet!

335
00:22:53,817 --> 00:22:55,364
Thank you.

336
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,906
Here's to a lousy Christmas!

337
00:22:58,906 --> 00:23:00,436
And a crappy New Year!

338
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:02,326
Hear, hear!

339
00:23:02,326 --> 00:23:03,406
Hear, hear!

340
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,982
All right! You guys, it's starting to snow.

341
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,987
And look, Ugly Naked Guy is hanging candy canes.

342
00:23:51,064 --> 00:23:52,861
Where?

343
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:56,062
Oh. Well.

344
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:58,094
That's festive.

345
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:04,002
Guys, there's somebody I'd like you to meet.

346
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,108
Wait, wait. What is that?

347
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:10,378
That's Marcel. Wanna say hi?

348
00:24:10,378 --> 00:24:11,874
No, I don't.

349
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:14,000
He's cute! Where'd you get him?

350
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,082
My friend Bethel saved him from a lab.

351
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:17,982
That is so cruel.

352
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:21,085
Why would a parent name their child Bethel?

353
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:27,093
That monkey's got a Ross on his ass.

354
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:34,907
Is he gonna live with you in your apartment?

355
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:37,943
Yeah. It's been kind of quiet since Carol left.

356
00:24:38,045 --> 00:24:39,979
Why not get a roommate?

357
00:24:40,047 --> 00:24:45,075
You reach a certain age, having a roommate is just kind of pathet--

358
00:24:48,055 --> 00:24:52,082
That's ''pathet.'' Sanskrit for ''really cool way to live.''

359
00:25:41,942 --> 00:25:44,035
I'm doing new material tonight.

360
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:48,980
I have 1 2 songs about my mother's suicide and one about a snowman.

361
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:53,952
You might wanna open with the snowman.

362
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:56,017
Hi, Joey.

363
00:25:56,017 --> 00:25:57,046
Hey, buddy.

364
00:25:57,858 --> 00:25:59,854
So how'd it go?

365
00:25:59,854 --> 00:26:01,850
I didn't get the job.

366
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:05,865
How could you not? You were Santa last year.

367
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,859
Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager.

368
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:14,974
He's not even jolly. It's all political.

369
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:16,538
What are you gonna be?

370
00:26:16,538 --> 00:26:18,068
One of his helpers.

371
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:21,871
It's just such a slap in the face, you know?

372
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:25,009
Do you know what you're doing for New Year's?

373
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:29,020
Hey, what? What is wrong with New Year's?

374
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:37,862
You have Paolo. You don't have to face the pressure of finding lips to kiss when the ball drops!

376
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:39,864
Man, I'm talking loud!

377
00:26:41,034 --> 00:26:44,868
Paolo's gonna be in Rome this New Year's.

378
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:46,934
I'll be just as pathetic as you.

379
00:26:46,934 --> 00:26:48,930
Yeah, you wish.

380
00:26:50,877 --> 00:26:52,936
I've got an idea. Dinner.

381
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:56,948
It's perfect. We'll put it between lunch and breakfast.

382
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:02,082
I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday.

383
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:06,950
I say this year, we make a pact. Just the six of us. Dinner.

384
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:07,539
Sure.

385
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:08,085
Fine.

386
00:27:08,895 --> 00:27:10,988
I was hoping for more enthusiasm.

387
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,013
Phoebe, you're on.

388
00:27:15,013 --> 00:27:16,059
Oh, good.

389
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:22,899
Hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand Miss Phoebe Buffay.

391
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,104
Hi. Thanks. Hi.

392
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:33,017
I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me.

393
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:41,817
I made a man with eyes of coal

394
00:27:41,928 --> 00:27:44,954
And a smile so bewitching

395
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:48,025
How was I supposed to know

396
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:51,065
That my mom was dead in the kitchen?

397
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:00,938
My mother's ashes

398
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:04,050
Even her eyelashes

399
00:28:04,885 --> 00:28:10,846
Are resting in a little yellow jar

400
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,994
And sometimes when it's freezing

401
00:28:16,897 --> 00:28:18,990
I feel a little sneezy

402
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:24,064
And now I-- Excuse me? Excuse me? Yeah, noisy boys.

403
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:29,908
Is it something you'd like to share with the group?

404
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:33,104
No. No, that's okay.

405
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,910
If it's important enough while I'm playing it's important enough for everyone else.

407
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,853
That guy's going home with a note.

408
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:49,443
I was just saying--

409
00:28:49,443 --> 00:28:50,825
Speak up.

410
00:28:50,931 --> 00:28:51,920
Sorry, I--

411
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:57,029
I was saying you were the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.

412
00:28:57,837 --> 00:29:03,034
And he said that Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen.

414
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:06,840
I said I liked her in Splash, but not Wall Street.

415
00:29:06,947 --> 00:29:09,939
I thought she had a hard quality.

416
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:17,955
While Daryl is beautiful in a conventional way you are luminous with a kind of delicate grace.

418
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,852
Then that's when you started yelling.

419
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:33,868
We're gonna take a short break.

420
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:40,903
That guy's going home with more than a note.

421
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,819
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.

422
00:29:51,858 --> 00:29:54,850
I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet.

423
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:59,831
By my sixth date with Paolo, he'd already named both my breasts.

424
00:30:02,936 --> 00:30:05,029
Did I just share too much?

425
00:30:06,873 --> 00:30:08,067
Just a smidge.

426
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:12,876
David's, like, a scientist guy. He's very methodical.

427
00:30:12,946 --> 00:30:13,958
I think it's romantic.

428
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:14,970
Me too!

429
00:30:15,048 --> 00:30:18,882
Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?

430
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:22,853
He's kind of like the guy I went to see that with.

431
00:30:27,861 --> 00:30:31,888
Except he's smarter and gentler and sweeter.

432
00:30:32,098 --> 00:30:34,999
I just wanna be with him all the time.

433
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:38,832
You know, day and night. And night and day.

434
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:41,806
And special occasions.

435
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,902
I see. You're gonna ask him to New Year's.

436
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:49,009
She's gonna break the pact.

437
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:51,005
No! No, no.

438
00:30:51,051 --> 00:30:53,815
No. Yeah, could I just--?

439
00:30:56,056 --> 00:30:57,540
Yeah. I already asked Janice.

440
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,024
What?

441
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:01,960
This was a pact! This was your pact!

442
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:04,929
I couldn't handle the pressure. I snapped!

443
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:07,966
But that was the worst breakup in history!

444
00:31:08,068 --> 00:31:11,868
I'm not saying it was a good idea. I snapped!

445
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:15,941
Hi, sorry I'm late.

446
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,050
Too many jokes.

447
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:28,978
Must mock Joey.

448
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:33,859
Nice shoes, huh?

449
00:31:34,861 --> 00:31:36,089
God, you're killing me!

450
00:31:38,031 --> 00:31:41,797
Ross, he's playing with my spatulas again!

451
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:44,352
He's not gonna hurt them, right?

452
00:31:44,352 --> 00:31:46,803
Do you always have to bring him?

453
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:52,844
I didn't wanna leave him alone. We had our first fight this morning.

454
00:31:54,047 --> 00:31:59,815
It has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean.

455
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:03,919
He threw some feces.

456
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,952
If you're working late, I can look in on him.

457
00:32:10,063 --> 00:32:11,928
That would be great!

458
00:32:12,065 --> 00:32:15,967
But make sure it seems like you're there to see him.

459
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:18,026
You're not doing it for me.

460
00:32:18,838 --> 00:32:21,830
Okay. But if he asks, I'm not going to lie.

461
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:30,880
But you can't actually test this theory.

462
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:37,437
Today's particle accelerators aren't powerful enough to simulate these conditions.

464
00:32:37,437 --> 00:32:39,786
I have a question then.

465
00:32:39,826 --> 00:32:40,923
Yeah?

466
00:32:40,923 --> 00:32:42,020
Do you plan on kissing me ever?

467
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:54,906
That's definitely a valid question, and the answer would be yes. Yes, I was.

469
00:32:59,045 --> 00:33:05,942
But I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss at a phenomenal moment because it's you.

471
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:07,008
Sure.

472
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,813
The longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be.

473
00:33:11,858 --> 00:33:18,954
Now, it's just gotta be one of those things where I sweep everything off the table.

475
00:33:19,065 --> 00:33:21,966
And I'm not really a sweeping sort of fella.

476
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:26,061
David, I think you are a sweeping sort of fella.

477
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:30,935
I mean, you're a sweeper trapped inside a physicist's body.

478
00:33:31,945 --> 00:33:32,508
Really?

479
00:33:32,508 --> 00:33:33,071
I'm sure.

480
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:36,838
You should just do it. Just throw me.

481
00:33:39,953 --> 00:33:40,999
Now?

482
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:42,045
Yeah, right now. Just....

483
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:44,089
Okay. Okay. Okay.

484
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,961
You know what? This is really expensive.

485
00:33:51,064 --> 00:33:52,998
And this was a gift.

486
00:33:54,067 --> 00:33:55,563
Now you're just tidying up.

487
00:33:55,563 --> 00:33:57,059
Okay.

488
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,370
You want me to throw you--?

489
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,866
I can hop.

490
00:34:20,994 --> 00:34:25,021
Tell me something, what does ''no-date pact'' mean to you?

491
00:34:25,098 --> 00:34:29,000
It's just that Chandler and Phoebe have somebody.

492
00:34:29,102 --> 00:34:31,093
I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.

493
00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:32,166
Your ex-boyfriend?

494
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:33,195
Yeah.

495
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:36,037
You know more than one Fun Bobby?

496
00:34:36,037 --> 00:34:38,067
I happen to know a Fun Bob.

497
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,513
Okay. Here we go.

498
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:44,947
There's no room for milk.

499
00:34:50,056 --> 00:34:52,081
There. Now there is.

500
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:56,989
So on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.

501
00:34:57,864 --> 00:34:58,910
Four.

502
00:34:58,910 --> 00:34:59,956
Five.

503
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,061
Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.

504
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,964
And I met this really hot single mom at the store.

505
00:35:07,874 --> 00:35:09,068
What's an elf to do?

506
00:35:09,976 --> 00:35:14,072
So I'll be the only one alone when the ball drops?

507
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:18,908
We'll have a big party, and no one will know who's with who.

508
00:35:18,985 --> 00:35:22,978
I'll know. This is so not what I needed right now.

509
00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:24,488
What's the matter?

510
00:35:24,488 --> 00:35:25,887
Oh, it's Marcel.

511
00:35:28,094 --> 00:35:33,031
He's angry with me. I have no idea why. He keeps shutting me out.

512
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:36,933
He's walking around all the time, dragging his hands.

513
00:35:37,837 --> 00:35:40,829
That's weird. I had a blast with him.

514
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,935
Really?

515
00:35:41,935 --> 00:35:42,930
We played, watched TV.

516
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:45,842
That juggling thing is amazing.

517
00:35:48,848 --> 00:35:50,839
What juggling thing?

518
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:54,042
With the socks? I figured you taught him that.

519
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,045
No.

520
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:01,857
It wasn't that big a deal. Just socks. And a melon.

521
00:36:05,898 --> 00:36:06,978
Phoebe!

522
00:36:06,978 --> 00:36:08,058
Max. Do you know everybody?

523
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:10,968
No. Have you seen David?

524
00:36:11,871 --> 00:36:12,997
He hasn't been around.

525
00:36:13,106 --> 00:36:17,065
If you see him, tell him to pack. We are going to Minsk.

526
00:36:17,877 --> 00:36:18,940
Minsk?

527
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,003
Minsk. It's in Russia.

528
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:23,004
I know where Minsk is.

529
00:36:24,884 --> 00:36:28,115
We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.

530
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:32,015
And if you're gonna do Minsk, that's the way to go.

531
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:34,105
So when do you leave?

532
00:36:34,105 --> 00:36:35,185
January 1st.

533
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:45,549
Hello?

534
00:36:45,549 --> 00:36:48,029
What? Hey. Hi.

535
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:50,405
What are you doing here?

536
00:36:50,405 --> 00:36:51,969
Max told me about Minsk.

537
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:54,979
Congratulations! This is so exciting!

538
00:36:56,149 --> 00:36:59,084
It'd be even more exciting if we were going.

539
00:36:59,852 --> 00:37:02,047
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?

540
00:37:03,856 --> 00:37:08,986
Tell her. ''I don't wanna go to work with Lipson, Yamaguchi and Flank.

542
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:12,155
I wanna stay and make out with my girlfriend!''

543
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:15,060
Okay, thank you, Max. Thank you.

544
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:18,871
So you're really not going?

545
00:37:18,971 --> 00:37:21,963
I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just....

546
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:24,975
How can I leave you? I just found you.

547
00:37:25,011 --> 00:37:28,879
Oh, David. But what are you gonna do?

548
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:33,076
I don't know. You decide.

549
00:37:33,886 --> 00:37:35,001
Don't do that.

550
00:37:35,001 --> 00:37:36,116
But I'm asking you.

551
00:37:36,856 --> 00:37:38,437
I can't make a decision. Just--

552
00:37:38,437 --> 00:37:40,018
Okay. Stay.

553
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:43,375
Stay.

554
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:43,921
Stay.

555
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:54,031
Getting so good at that!

556
00:37:55,842 --> 00:37:57,867
It was Max's stuff.

557
00:38:05,852 --> 00:38:08,082
I love this artichoke thing.

558
00:38:08,855 --> 00:38:11,983
Don't tell me what's in it. The diet starts tomorrow.

559
00:38:16,863 --> 00:38:18,956
You remember Janice.

560
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:21,866
Vividly.

561
00:38:22,068 --> 00:38:24,019
How are you?

562
00:38:24,019 --> 00:38:25,970
I am fantastic.

563
00:38:26,005 --> 00:38:26,994
Now.

564
00:38:28,908 --> 00:38:34,044
It's amazing. We've been back together for what like 10 minutes, and--

566
00:38:34,044 --> 00:38:35,176
Is that all?

567
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:38,907
It's like we were never apart.

568
00:38:39,018 --> 00:38:42,818
Of course, we were, but-- Forgive and forget.

569
00:38:42,922 --> 00:38:45,015
Well, forget.

570
00:38:55,968 --> 00:38:56,514
Hi.

571
00:38:56,514 --> 00:38:57,060
Hi, I'm Sandy.

572
00:38:57,837 --> 00:38:59,930
Sandy, hi. Come on in.

573
00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:11,962
You brought your kids.

574
00:39:11,962 --> 00:39:13,975
Yeah. That's okay, right?

575
00:39:16,055 --> 00:39:18,455
Party!

576
00:39:18,455 --> 00:39:20,855
That thing is not coming in here!

577
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,053
This is how you greet guests?

578
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:27,993
If I showed up with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome?

579
00:39:28,901 --> 00:39:32,894
Your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.

580
00:39:32,972 --> 00:39:36,066
He was more embarrassed about that than anyone.

581
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:44,008
And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened--

583
00:39:45,017 --> 00:39:48,043
All right. All right. Just keep him away from me.

584
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:50,913
Thank you. Come on, Marcel.

585
00:39:51,123 --> 00:39:53,921
What do you say you and I mingle?

586
00:39:54,961 --> 00:39:59,057
All right, I'll catch up with you later.

587
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:09,830
Oh, my gosh! Rachel, honey, are you okay?

588
00:40:09,942 --> 00:40:12,410
Where's Paolo?

589
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,878
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.

590
00:40:15,047 --> 00:40:17,072
And then your face exploded?

591
00:40:18,951 --> 00:40:19,975
No.

592
00:40:20,953 --> 00:40:34,058
Okay. I was at the airport getting into a cab when this woman, this blond planet with a pocketbook starts yelling. Something about how it was her cab first.

595
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:38,036
The next thing, she just starts pulling me out by my hair!

596
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:44,001
And I was blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up.

598
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:49,008
So as I'm going to get into a cab, she tackles me!

599
00:40:49,815 --> 00:40:54,843
And I hit my head on the curb and cut my lip on my whistle.

600
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:00,917
Everybody having fun at the party?

601
00:41:02,962 --> 00:41:04,395
Are people eating my dip?

602
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:05,828
Yes.

603
00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:12,029
There.

604
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:14,951
That looks okay, right?

605
00:41:14,951 --> 00:41:16,964
You went a bit wide on the lipstick.

606
00:41:17,043 --> 00:41:18,459
Oh, I did?

607
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:19,875
Yeah.

608
00:41:19,945 --> 00:41:23,847
It's hard for me to tell. My eye's closing up.

609
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:25,884
Let me get it for you.

610
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:27,515
Ow!

611
00:41:27,515 --> 00:41:28,044
Okay.

612
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:30,879
You know what? It looks fine.

613
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:33,888
Okay, here we go.

614
00:41:33,993 --> 00:41:37,929
Screw Paolo, screw the psycho cab lady.

615
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:40,999
It's New Year's Eve. Let's have a good time.

616
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:41,983
Okay, here we go.

617
00:41:41,983 --> 00:41:42,933
Okay.

618
00:41:43,002 --> 00:41:45,994
All right, there you go. This way.

619
00:41:47,106 --> 00:41:48,937
Here you go.

620
00:41:52,044 --> 00:41:59,945
When I saw you at the store last week it was the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.

622
00:42:02,054 --> 00:42:04,033
Wow, that's dirty.

623
00:42:04,033 --> 00:42:06,012
Yeah.

624
00:42:09,962 --> 00:42:11,122
Hey, kids.

625
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:18,870
He doesn't have to spend the whole evening with me but at least check in.

627
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:21,973
There you are!

628
00:42:23,843 --> 00:42:26,038
You got away from me.

629
00:42:26,846 --> 00:42:28,842
But you found me.

630
00:42:28,842 --> 00:42:30,838
Here, Ross, take our picture.

631
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:34,044
Smile. You're on Janice Camera.

632
00:42:34,987 --> 00:42:36,818
IKill me. IKill me now.

633
00:42:41,827 --> 00:42:44,091
Hi, I'm Rachel.

634
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,923
So whose friend are you?

635
00:42:50,803 --> 00:42:53,931
Look at me, spilling everywhere.

636
00:42:55,908 --> 00:42:57,842
Everybody, it's Fun Bobby!

637
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:06,112
Hey, sorry I'm late. But my grandfather died about two hours ago.

639
00:43:06,852 --> 00:43:12,051
But I couldn't get a flight out till tomorrow, so here I am.

640
00:43:12,925 --> 00:43:18,056
Hey, Fun Bobby! How's it going, man? Whoa! Who died?

641
00:43:22,835 --> 00:43:25,133
It's gonna be an open casket, you know?

642
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:29,137
So at least I'll get to see him again.

643
00:43:33,846 --> 00:43:36,940
Bobby? Fun Bobby?

644
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:40,043
Let me talk to you for just a sec.

645
00:43:40,886 --> 00:43:46,090
I recently lost a grandparent myself so I really know exactly how you feel.

647
00:43:46,892 --> 00:43:49,861
But you're really bringing the party down.

648
00:43:50,963 --> 00:43:52,009
I'm sorry.

649
00:43:52,009 --> 00:43:53,055
Yeah, yeah, okay.

650
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:56,157
There you go. There you go.

651
00:43:57,903 --> 00:44:02,863
I'm gonna blow this one up and write ''Reunited'' in glitter.

652
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:04,909
All right, Janice, that's it!

653
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,877
Janice. Janice.

654
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:12,883
Hey, Janice, when I invited you, I didn't think it meant--

655
00:44:12,985 --> 00:44:15,010
Oh, no!

656
00:44:19,091 --> 00:44:21,889
I'm sorry you misunderstood.

657
00:44:21,994 --> 00:44:24,019
You listen to me! You listen to me!

658
00:44:24,129 --> 00:44:29,032
One of these times, it's just gonna be your last chance with me!

659
00:44:31,036 --> 00:44:33,004
Will you give me the thing?

660
00:44:36,876 --> 00:44:37,922
Hi, Max.

661
00:44:37,922 --> 00:44:38,968
Yoko.

662
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:47,075
I've decided to go to Minsk without you.

663
00:44:48,854 --> 00:44:49,951
Wow.

664
00:44:49,951 --> 00:44:55,891
It won't be the same...but it will still be Minsk. Happy New Year.

666
00:44:57,096 --> 00:44:59,047
Are you all right?

667
00:44:59,047 --> 00:45:00,998
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

668
00:45:06,171 --> 00:45:07,968
Come on.

669
00:45:10,009 --> 00:45:12,039
You're going to Minsk.

670
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:14,069
No, I'm not going to Minsk.

671
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,074
You are so going to Minsk.

672
00:45:16,115 --> 00:45:20,074
You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just for me.

673
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:23,081
If I go, I have to break up with you.

674
00:45:23,188 --> 00:45:24,655
And I can't break up with you.

675
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:26,122
Yes, you can.

676
00:45:26,926 --> 00:45:31,022
Just say, ''Phoebe, I love you, but my work is my life.

677
00:45:31,096 --> 00:45:32,996
That's what I have to do.''

678
00:45:33,098 --> 00:45:36,932
And I say, ''Your work? How can you say that?''

679
00:45:38,037 --> 00:45:43,065
Then you say, ''I have no choice. Can't you understand that?''

680
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:47,835
And I say, ''No! No! I can't understand that!''

681
00:45:47,947 --> 00:45:48,510
Ow.

682
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:49,073
Sorry.

683
00:45:50,983 --> 00:45:53,952
And then you put your arms around me.

684
00:45:54,053 --> 00:45:55,953
Then you put your arms around me.

685
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:57,853
Oh, sorry.

686
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:02,959
And then you tell me you love me and you'll never forget me.

687
00:46:03,062 --> 00:46:05,087
I'll never forget you.

688
00:46:06,966 --> 00:46:14,862
Then you say that you have to go because you don't wanna start the year with me if you can't finish it.

690
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:24,177
I'm gonna miss you, you scientist guy.

691
00:46:26,986 --> 00:46:28,977
Hi, Dick Clark in Times Square.

692
00:46:29,088 --> 00:46:33,991
We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square.

693
00:46:34,093 --> 00:46:35,993
It gets better every....

694
00:46:36,095 --> 00:46:38,029
Here you go, kids.

695
00:46:38,831 --> 00:46:41,026
And then the peacock bit me.

696
00:46:42,034 --> 00:46:43,934
Please kiss me at midnight!

697
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:50,941
You seen Sandy?

698
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:56,972
I don't know how to tell you this but she's in the bedroom getting it on with Max.

700
00:46:57,049 --> 00:46:59,847
Oh, I did know how to tell you.

701
00:47:00,953 --> 00:47:02,517
Hey, everybody, the ball is dropping.

702
00:47:02,517 --> 00:47:04,081
What?

703
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:08,082
The ball is dropping!

704
00:47:09,962 --> 00:47:12,089
In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.

705
00:47:12,865 --> 00:47:15,060
And the moment of joy is upon us.

706
00:47:15,968 --> 00:47:18,903
Looks like that no-date pact worked out.

707
00:47:19,071 --> 00:47:21,904
Everybody looks so happy. I hate that!

708
00:47:21,974 --> 00:47:24,067
Not everybody is happy. Hey, Bobby!

709
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:30,014
--four, three, two one! Happy New Year!

711
00:47:32,084 --> 00:47:40,858
I thought I'd throw this out. I'm no math whiz but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.

713
00:47:41,927 --> 00:47:44,862
I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.

714
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:46,914
I can't kiss anyone.

715
00:47:46,914 --> 00:47:48,865
So, I'm kissing everyone?

716
00:47:49,835 --> 00:47:52,861
No, you can't kiss Ross. That's your brother.

717
00:47:52,938 --> 00:47:55,133
So now everybody's getting kissed but me.

718
00:47:55,874 --> 00:47:56,932
Somebody kiss me.

719
00:47:57,042 --> 00:48:00,944
Somebody kiss me! It's midnight! Somebody kiss me!

720
00:48:01,046 --> 00:48:02,980
All right! All right!

721
00:48:03,882 --> 00:48:04,974
There!

722
00:48:11,857 --> 00:48:13,984
I wanted this to work so much.

723
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,860
I'm still in there.

724
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:19,887
Changing his diapers. Picking his fleas.

725
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:22,897
But he's just phoning it in.

726
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:29,898
It's hard that something you love so much doesn't love you back.

727
00:48:29,975 --> 00:48:33,001
I think that bitch cracked my tooth.

728
00:48:38,878 --> 00:48:41,779
Do you think they have yesterday's Daily News?

729
00:48:41,881 --> 00:48:45,647
I just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.

730
00:48:46,752 --> 00:48:54,750
Oh, my God! Don't look now. Behind you there's a guy who can break our hearts and plunge us into depression.

732
00:48:55,895 --> 00:48:57,795
Come to mama.

733
00:48:58,697 --> 00:49:00,858
He's coming. Be cool. Be cool. Be cool.

734
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,282
Nice hat.

735
00:49:02,282 --> 00:49:03,664
Thanks.

736
00:49:03,869 --> 00:49:05,319
We should do something. Whistle.

737
00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:06,769
I'm not whistling.

738
00:49:06,806 --> 00:49:07,795
Come on, do it!

739
00:49:07,873 --> 00:49:09,932
Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.

740
00:49:15,781 --> 00:49:17,874
I can't believe you did that.

741
00:50:05,798 --> 00:50:07,231
It's all my fault.

742
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:08,664
No, it's mine.

743
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,667
Why did I whoo-hoo?

744
00:50:10,703 --> 00:50:15,898
Was I hoping he'd turn around and say ''I love that sound. I must have you now''?

746
00:50:16,876 --> 00:50:19,777
I wish there was something we could do.

747
00:50:22,681 --> 00:50:23,705
Hello, coma guy.

748
00:50:25,684 --> 00:50:27,675
Get up, you Girl Scout! Up, up, up!

749
00:50:27,786 --> 00:50:28,810
What are you doing?

750
00:50:28,921 --> 00:50:30,889
Maybe nobody's tried this.

751
00:50:33,826 --> 00:50:35,919
I wish we at least knew his name.

752
00:50:36,695 --> 00:50:38,822
I hate that they're calling him John Doe.

753
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:42,765
It's so sad. It's like he's a deer, a female deer.

754
00:50:43,669 --> 00:50:45,728
Oh, I was gonna stop.

755
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,800
Look at that face.

756
00:50:48,941 --> 00:50:51,637
Even sleeping he looks smart.

757
00:50:51,744 --> 00:50:54,838
Yeah, but the dents in his knuckles mean he's artistic.

758
00:50:55,748 --> 00:50:59,741
Okay. He's a lawyer who teaches sculpting on the side.

759
00:50:59,852 --> 00:51:01,683
And he can dance.

760
00:51:02,655 --> 00:51:11,786
And he's the kind of guy who, when you're talking, he's listening not saying, ''I understand'' but really wondering what you look like naked.

763
00:51:14,667 --> 00:51:16,862
I wish all guys could be like him.

764
00:51:18,771 --> 00:51:19,795
I know.

765
00:51:24,877 --> 00:51:26,811
You don't even know this guy.

766
00:51:26,912 --> 00:51:30,780
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?

767
00:51:31,784 --> 00:51:32,876
He doesn't have anyone.

768
00:51:32,985 --> 00:51:35,681
We feel kind of responsible.

769
00:51:35,888 --> 00:51:38,652
I can't believe you said ''whoo-hoo.''

770
00:51:38,857 --> 00:51:40,722
I don't even say ''whoo-hoo.''

771
00:51:40,826 --> 00:51:42,657
Oh, she's coming up.

772
00:51:42,728 --> 00:51:47,631
When we return, we'll talk with the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.

773
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:49,724
Put the kids to bed for this one.

774
00:51:49,835 --> 00:51:53,669
Don't watch this. Weekend at Bernie's is on Showtime and HBO.

775
00:51:53,739 --> 00:51:54,728
No way.

776
00:51:54,873 --> 00:51:56,824
She's your mom.

777
00:51:56,824 --> 00:51:58,775
Exactly. Weekend at Bernie's.

778
00:51:58,844 --> 00:52:02,746
Dead guy getting hit in the groin 20, 30 times.

779
00:52:03,849 --> 00:52:06,841
I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books.

780
00:52:07,653 --> 00:52:09,848
I can't get on a plane without one. This is so cool.

781
00:52:10,656 --> 00:52:17,659
You wouldn't think so if you were 1 1  and your friends were passing around page 79 of Mistress Bitch.

783
00:52:17,763 --> 00:52:19,890
I remember page 79.

784
00:52:20,699 --> 00:52:24,795
The thing after the opera with the girl with the trick hip?

785
00:52:27,673 --> 00:52:29,698
I love your mom. I think she's a blast.

786
00:52:29,808 --> 00:52:31,776
That's because she's not your mom.

787
00:52:31,877 --> 00:52:32,901
Oh, please. She's the--

788
00:52:33,712 --> 00:52:34,974
Hi, sweetie.

789
00:52:36,915 --> 00:52:39,816
When did ''Rigatoni'' get back from Rome?

790
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,166
Last night.

791
00:52:42,166 --> 00:52:42,712
Really?

792
00:52:42,821 --> 00:52:45,847
So, his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?

793
00:52:46,659 --> 00:52:47,921
Just a dream I had.

794
00:52:48,727 --> 00:52:49,716
But, phew!

795
00:52:50,863 --> 00:52:52,626
Hey, she's on.

796
00:52:55,668 --> 00:52:56,828
Nora Bing.

797
00:52:58,737 --> 00:53:02,833
Back to the book. What is this about you being arrested in London?

798
00:53:03,676 --> 00:53:04,836
Your mom was arrested?

799
00:53:04,943 --> 00:53:06,877
I'm busy beaming with pride.

800
00:53:07,846 --> 00:53:13,875
This is kind of embarrassing...but occasionally, after I've been intimate with a man...

802
00:53:14,753 --> 00:53:16,846
Why would she say that's embarrassing?

803
00:53:17,856 --> 00:53:20,882
...I just get this craving for kung pao chicken.

804
00:53:21,694 --> 00:53:23,685
That's too much information.

805
00:53:27,766 --> 00:53:31,759
Needless to say, he got a huge tip.

806
00:53:34,707 --> 00:53:35,867
Oh, God, I love her!

807
00:53:35,908 --> 00:53:38,638
I think I'm having a stroke.

808
00:53:39,745 --> 00:53:42,646
So how is your book tour going?

809
00:53:42,748 --> 00:53:46,741
Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate.

810
00:53:46,852 --> 00:53:48,911
But I get to see my son, who I love.

811
00:53:50,856 --> 00:53:54,758
This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.

812
00:53:54,927 --> 00:53:58,863
Don't take this wrong, I just don't see you as a mom.

813
00:53:59,631 --> 00:54:02,930
-I don't mean that bad.
-Oh, no. I'm a fabulous mom.

814
00:54:03,836 --> 00:54:05,770
I bought my son his first condoms.

815
00:54:11,844 --> 00:54:13,937
And then he burst into flames.

816
00:54:22,855 --> 00:54:26,951
Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit-reduction bill.

817
00:54:27,693 --> 00:54:32,653
The mayor wants to raise subway fares. The high today was 45.

818
00:54:33,665 --> 00:54:35,690
And teams played sports.

819
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,657
What about Glen?

820
00:55:03,829 --> 00:55:04,853
He could be a Glen.

821
00:55:05,631 --> 00:55:06,859
Not special enough.

822
00:55:07,766 --> 00:55:09,734
How about Agamemnon?

823
00:55:09,935 --> 00:55:12,631
Way too special.

824
00:55:20,646 --> 00:55:22,739
I'm famished. What do I want?

825
00:55:22,848 --> 00:55:25,874
Please, God, don't let it be kung pao chicken.

826
00:55:26,685 --> 00:55:29,654
You watched the show. What did you think?

827
00:55:29,688 --> 00:55:31,883
I think you need to come out of your shell.

828
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:36,760
What is this dive?

829
00:55:36,862 --> 00:55:38,830
Only you could've picked this place.

830
00:55:39,731 --> 00:55:42,791
Come on. Shut up. It's fun. Give me a hug.

831
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:46,832
I heard about the divorce. Lesbian, huh?

832
00:55:48,607 --> 00:55:53,601
Well, you know what they say: Be careful what you wish for.

833
00:55:55,714 --> 00:55:57,181
I think we're ready for some tequila.

834
00:55:57,181 --> 00:55:58,648
I know I am.

835
00:55:58,717 --> 00:55:59,712
Who's doing shots?

836
00:55:59,712 --> 00:56:00,707
Hit me.

837
00:56:00,752 --> 00:56:01,810
There you go. Ross?

838
00:56:02,721 --> 00:56:04,814
I'm not really a shot-drinking kind of guy.

839
00:56:05,624 --> 00:56:06,818
Hi. Sorry we're late.

840
00:56:06,859 --> 00:56:10,727
We kind of just, you know, lost track of time.

841
00:56:12,831 --> 00:56:14,765
But a man can change.

842
00:56:20,739 --> 00:56:22,866
Anyone want me to appraise anything?

843
00:56:33,852 --> 00:56:36,787
Well, I'm gonna go to tinker-town.

844
00:56:36,855 --> 00:56:39,790
Mrs. Bing, I've read everything you've written.

845
00:56:40,592 --> 00:56:44,585
When I read Euphoria at Midnight, I wanted to become a writer.

846
00:56:44,696 --> 00:56:47,597
Oh, please. If I can do it, anybody can.

847
00:56:47,733 --> 00:56:55,637
Start with half a dozen European cities throw in 30 euphemisms for male genitalia and you've got yourself a book.

850
00:56:56,742 --> 00:56:59,609
My mother, ladies and gentlemen.

851
00:57:02,614 --> 00:57:05,606
Yeah, any messages for room 226?

852
00:57:06,752 --> 00:57:08,282
You okay, slugger?

853
00:57:08,282 --> 00:57:09,812
Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

854
00:57:22,734 --> 00:57:24,634
What is with you tonight?

855
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:26,865
Nothing. Nothing, nothing.

856
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:29,636
Okay, thank you.

857
00:57:32,678 --> 00:57:34,908
It's the Italian hand-licker, isn't it?

858
00:57:35,747 --> 00:57:37,772
No. It's the one he's licking.

859
00:57:38,817 --> 00:57:40,785
She's supposed to be with you.

860
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,778
You're good.

861
00:57:43,789 --> 00:57:48,692
I have sold 100 million copies of my books, and you know why?

862
00:57:48,894 --> 00:57:51,829
The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?

863
00:57:53,832 --> 00:57:58,792
No, because I know how to write men that women fall in love with.

864
00:57:59,638 --> 00:58:01,606
I cannot sell a Paolo.

865
00:58:01,707 --> 00:58:04,699
People will not turn 325 pages for a Paolo.

866
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:07,802
Come on. The guy's a secondary character.

867
00:58:08,613 --> 00:58:11,707
He's just a complication you eventually kill off.

868
00:58:12,818 --> 00:58:13,842
When?

869
00:58:16,621 --> 00:58:18,714
He's not a hero.

870
00:58:19,624 --> 00:58:20,818
You know who our hero is?

871
00:58:21,626 --> 00:58:23,753
The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?

872
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:25,822
No, it's you.

873
00:58:26,631 --> 00:58:27,177
Please.

874
00:58:27,177 --> 00:58:27,723
No, really.

875
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:30,631
Come on. You're smart. You're sexy.

876
00:58:30,836 --> 00:58:31,786
Right.

877
00:58:31,786 --> 00:58:32,736
Yes, you are.

878
00:58:32,838 --> 00:58:36,672
The fact that you don't think you are makes you sexier.

879
00:58:36,742 --> 00:58:40,735
Come on, kiddo. You're gonna be fine, believe me.

880
00:59:00,665 --> 00:59:01,962
I'll just pee in the street.

881
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:12,699
Is Chandler here?

882
00:59:12,911 --> 00:59:14,674
Wait. Come here.

883
00:59:15,881 --> 00:59:21,719
Okay, about last night you know Chandler, you didn't tell....

886
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:25,916
We don't need to tell Chandler. It was just a kiss. No big deal, right?

887
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:27,919
Right. No big deal.

888
00:59:28,727 --> 00:59:29,887
In bizarro world.

889
00:59:33,799 --> 00:59:34,788
You broke the code.

890
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,333
What code?

891
00:59:36,333 --> 00:59:37,766
You don't kiss your friend's mom.

892
00:59:37,836 --> 00:59:41,738
Sisters are okay. Maybe a hot-looking aunt.

893
00:59:41,773 --> 00:59:43,934
But not a mom. Never a mom.

894
00:59:46,878 --> 00:59:48,846
What are you guys doing out here?

895
00:59:49,648 --> 00:59:52,776
Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game.

896
00:59:54,653 --> 00:59:57,679
But apparently somebody overslept.

897
00:59:59,658 --> 01:00:00,955
Well, you don't have your racquet.

898
01:00:01,693 --> 01:00:03,888
No. No, I don't because it's being restrung.

899
01:00:04,696 --> 01:00:06,755
Somebody was supposed to bring me one.

900
01:00:07,799 --> 01:00:10,791
Well, you didn't call and leave your grip size.

901
01:00:12,904 --> 01:00:15,873
You guys are spending way too much time together.

902
01:00:18,877 --> 01:00:20,708
I'm scum. I'm scum.

903
01:00:20,812 --> 01:00:21,858
How could you let this happen?

904
01:00:21,858 --> 01:00:22,904
I don't know.

905
01:00:23,715 --> 01:00:25,683
It's not like she's a regular mom.

906
01:00:25,784 --> 01:00:27,684
She's sexy. She's....

907
01:00:27,786 --> 01:00:29,811
You don't think my mom's sexy?

908
01:00:30,922 --> 01:00:33,789
Well, not in the same way.

909
01:00:33,892 --> 01:00:37,828
I'll have you know, Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day.

910
01:00:39,631 --> 01:00:42,725
You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?

911
01:00:44,736 --> 01:00:47,728
Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here.

912
01:00:49,841 --> 01:00:51,638
What are you doing here?

913
01:00:52,844 --> 01:00:54,744
Not playing racquetball.

914
01:00:56,848 --> 01:00:58,844
He forgot to leave his grip size.

915
01:00:58,844 --> 01:01:00,840
He didn't get the goggles.

916
01:01:02,888 --> 01:01:05,686
Sounds like you two have issues.

917
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:09,784
Goodbye, baby.

918
01:01:11,963 --> 01:01:14,693
Do they wait for me to do this?

919
01:01:20,772 --> 01:01:22,268
Are you gonna tell him?

920
01:01:22,268 --> 01:01:23,764
Why would I tell him?

921
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:26,673
If you don't, his mother might.

922
01:01:27,779 --> 01:01:29,872
What are you guys doing here?

923
01:01:30,782 --> 01:01:32,875
He's not even wearing a jock strap.

924
01:01:38,657 --> 01:01:40,648
What did I ask?

925
01:01:54,839 --> 01:01:56,670
What are you doing here?

926
01:01:56,741 --> 01:02:01,641
Nothing. I just thought I'd stop by, you know, after that I, you know.

928
01:02:01,746 --> 01:02:03,646
So, what are you doing here?

929
01:02:04,683 --> 01:02:06,651
I'm not really here.

930
01:02:06,751 --> 01:02:10,847
I just thought I'd drop these off on the way. My way.

931
01:02:13,692 --> 01:02:18,658
Do you come here a lot without me?

933
01:02:18,763 --> 01:02:20,754
No, no, no.

934
01:02:23,868 --> 01:02:27,668
Do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?

935
01:02:28,873 --> 01:02:31,671
How would I know? I wasn't here.

936
01:02:31,776 --> 01:02:34,870
Really? Not even to change his pajamas?

937
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:39,817
Oh, my God.

938
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:42,814
You're my friend. I had to tell you.

939
01:02:43,622 --> 01:02:44,816
I can't believe it.

940
01:02:45,824 --> 01:02:47,621
Paolo kissed my mom?

941
01:02:48,727 --> 01:02:51,753
I don't know if you noticed, but he drank a lot.

942
01:02:51,863 --> 01:02:54,730
I mean, you know how he gets--

943
01:02:56,735 --> 01:02:58,669
I can't do this. I did it.

944
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:00,863
It was me. I'm sorry. I kissed your mom.

945
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:02,729
What?

946
01:03:02,941 --> 01:03:14,648
I was upset about Rachel and I had too much tequila, and Nora Mrs. Mom, your Bing, was...being nice. But nothing happened.

949
01:03:14,753 --> 01:03:15,742
Nothing. Ask Joey.

950
01:03:15,887 --> 01:03:17,371
Joey came in--

951
01:03:17,371 --> 01:03:18,855
You knew about this?

952
01:03:19,658 --> 01:03:21,853
You know, knowledge is a tricky thing.

953
01:03:22,794 --> 01:03:24,887
Why didn't you tell me?

954
01:03:25,697 --> 01:03:28,894
You're lucky I caught them, or else who knows what would've happened?

955
01:03:29,701 --> 01:03:30,793
Thanks, man. Big help.

956
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:33,761
What the hell were you thinking?

957
01:03:33,872 --> 01:03:35,863
I wasn't. I don't know. I--

958
01:03:35,907 --> 01:03:39,638
No one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.

959
01:03:39,711 --> 01:03:40,723
I know.

960
01:03:40,723 --> 01:03:41,735
I can't believe you did this.

961
01:03:41,846 --> 01:03:43,228
Me neither.

962
01:03:43,228 --> 01:03:44,610
I'm mad at you too.

963
01:03:44,716 --> 01:03:46,166
Why are you mad at me--?

964
01:03:46,166 --> 01:03:47,616
Let me slam the door.

965
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:52,713
I didn't kiss her. See what happens when you break the code?

966
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:08,862
''A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Greene.''

967
01:04:09,641 --> 01:04:12,735
I thought I'd give it a shot. I'm on the first chapter.

968
01:04:12,844 --> 01:04:17,838
Do you think his ''love stick'' can be ''liberated from its denim prison''?

969
01:04:19,751 --> 01:04:21,776
Yeah, I'd say so.

970
01:04:21,953 --> 01:04:25,650
And there's no ''J'' in ''engorged.''

971
01:04:30,795 --> 01:04:32,228
You going to the hospital tonight?

972
01:04:32,228 --> 01:04:33,661
No. You?

973
01:04:33,865 --> 01:04:34,889
No. You?

974
01:04:37,736 --> 01:04:39,727
You just asked me.

975
01:04:39,804 --> 01:04:41,795
Maybe it was a trick question.

976
01:04:43,742 --> 01:04:45,835
Rachel, can we do this now?

977
01:04:47,812 --> 01:04:49,803
I am so hot.

978
01:04:51,716 --> 01:04:54,651
Here's my mom and dad on their wedding day.

979
01:04:54,753 --> 01:04:57,745
Now, you tell me she's not a knockout.

980
01:04:59,624 --> 01:05:02,275
I can't believe this conversation.

981
01:05:02,275 --> 01:05:04,926
Just try to picture her not pregnant.

982
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:10,733
Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.

983
01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:12,737
Thanks.

984
01:05:14,839 --> 01:05:22,779
I'd like to start with a song about a man I recently met who's come to be very important to me.

986
01:05:27,886 --> 01:05:31,788
You don't have to be awake To be my man

987
01:05:33,892 --> 01:05:38,795
Long as you have brain waves I'll be there to hold your hand

988
01:05:40,632 --> 01:05:42,657
Though we just met the other day

989
01:05:42,801 --> 01:05:46,601
There's something I have got to say

990
01:05:47,639 --> 01:05:50,608
Thank you very much. I'm gonna take a short break.

991
01:05:52,811 --> 01:05:56,611
That was Phoebe Buffay, everybody.

992
01:05:57,682 --> 01:05:59,149
What the hell was that?

993
01:05:59,149 --> 01:06:00,616
Phoebe just started--

994
01:06:00,685 --> 01:06:04,746
I was talking to Joey. All right, there, mother-kisser?

995
01:06:09,694 --> 01:06:10,820
''Mother-kisser.''

996
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:13,754
I'll shut up.

997
01:06:13,865 --> 01:06:19,703
I know you're still mad at me but there were two people there that night.

999
01:06:19,871 --> 01:06:21,367
There were two sets of lips.

1000
01:06:21,367 --> 01:06:22,863
I expect this from her.

1001
01:06:23,741 --> 01:06:25,868
She's always been a Freudian nightmare.

1002
01:06:26,644 --> 01:06:29,670
Then why don't you say something?

1003
01:06:29,747 --> 01:06:32,716
Because it's complicated. It's complex.

1004
01:06:32,851 --> 01:06:34,648
You kissed my mom.

1005
01:06:37,889 --> 01:06:40,585
We're rehearsing a Greek play.

1006
01:06:41,726 --> 01:06:43,660
That's funny. Are we done now?

1007
01:06:43,728 --> 01:06:46,788
You mean you're not gonna tell her how you feel?

1008
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:53,728
Just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. You can't talk to her.

1010
01:06:53,838 --> 01:06:56,602
Okay. ''You can't''? Or you can't?

1011
01:06:57,742 --> 01:06:58,834
Okay, that's my finger.

1012
01:06:59,644 --> 01:07:01,805
Okay, that's my knee.

1013
01:07:02,614 --> 01:07:03,706
Still doing the play.

1014
01:07:12,624 --> 01:07:13,750
What did you do with him?

1015
01:07:17,862 --> 01:07:18,846
You're awake.

1016
01:07:18,846 --> 01:07:19,830
Look at you.

1017
01:07:20,632 --> 01:07:21,860
How do you feel?

1018
01:07:22,667 --> 01:07:24,658
A little woozy, but basically okay.

1019
01:07:24,736 --> 01:07:26,727
Gosh, you look good.

1020
01:07:26,771 --> 01:07:27,863
I feel good.

1021
01:07:29,674 --> 01:07:30,834
Who are you?

1022
01:07:30,875 --> 01:07:31,825
Sorry.

1023
01:07:31,825 --> 01:07:32,775
I'm Phoebe.

1024
01:07:32,844 --> 01:07:35,677
I'm Monica. I've been caring for you.

1025
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:36,747
We both have.

1026
01:07:36,881 --> 01:07:38,331
The Etch A Sketch is from you?

1027
01:07:38,331 --> 01:07:39,781
Actually, me.

1028
01:07:40,585 --> 01:07:41,682
I got you the foot massager.

1029
01:07:41,682 --> 01:07:42,779
I shaved you.

1030
01:07:42,887 --> 01:07:44,252
I read to you.

1031
01:07:44,252 --> 01:07:45,617
I sang.

1032
01:07:47,692 --> 01:07:48,784
Well, thanks.

1033
01:07:49,594 --> 01:07:50,640
Oh, my pleasure.

1034
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:51,686
You're welcome.

1035
01:07:51,729 --> 01:07:54,698
So I guess I'll see you around.

1036
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,700
What? That's it?

1037
01:07:58,603 --> 01:07:59,729
''See you around''?

1038
01:07:59,837 --> 01:08:01,333
What do you want me to say?

1039
01:08:01,333 --> 01:08:02,829
I don't know.

1040
01:08:03,641 --> 01:08:06,606
Maybe ''That was nice.''

1042
01:08:06,711 --> 01:08:07,803
''It meant something to me.''

1043
01:08:08,846 --> 01:08:10,711
''I'll call you.''

1044
01:08:11,749 --> 01:08:13,296
Okay. I'll call you.

1045
01:08:13,296 --> 01:08:14,843
I don't think you mean that.

1046
01:08:18,656 --> 01:08:20,624
This is so typical.

1047
01:08:20,758 --> 01:08:24,922
You know, we give and we give and we give.

1049
01:08:25,663 --> 01:08:27,722
And we just get nothing back.

1050
01:08:27,765 --> 01:08:31,724
And then one day, you wake up, and it's, ''See you around.''

1051
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:35,635
Let's go, Phoebe.

1052
01:08:37,675 --> 01:08:40,769
You know what? We thought you were different.

1053
01:08:40,845 --> 01:08:42,938
But I guess it was just the coma.

1054
01:08:53,758 --> 01:08:57,751
The car's waiting. I just wanted to drop off my book for your friends.

1055
01:08:57,795 --> 01:09:01,697
Autographed. And give you a goodbye kiss.

1056
01:09:01,799 --> 01:09:04,768
Here's the kiss, here's the goodbye....

1057
01:09:04,902 --> 01:09:07,302
Anything you want from Lisbon?

1058
01:09:07,302 --> 01:09:09,702
Just knowing you're there is enough.

1059
01:09:09,874 --> 01:09:13,674
All right. Well, be good. I love you.

1060
01:09:16,714 --> 01:09:18,807
You kissed my best Ross.

1061
01:09:20,885 --> 01:09:23,683
Or something to that effect.

1062
01:09:29,794 --> 01:09:31,728
Look, it was stupid.

1063
01:09:31,796 --> 01:09:32,808
Really stupid.

1064
01:09:32,808 --> 01:09:33,820
Really stupid.

1065
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,662
I don't even know how it happened.

1066
01:09:38,836 --> 01:09:43,671
I'm sorry, honey. I promise it will never happen again.

1067
01:09:43,775 --> 01:09:45,675
Really, really stupid.

1068
01:09:45,777 --> 01:09:47,870
Really, really stupid.

1069
01:09:49,647 --> 01:09:50,710
Are we okay now?

1070
01:09:50,710 --> 01:09:51,773
Yeah.

1071
01:09:51,949 --> 01:09:53,644
No.

1072
01:09:58,756 --> 01:10:01,782
The forbidden love of a man and his door.

1073
01:10:03,761 --> 01:10:06,855
He told her off. And not just about the kiss.

1074
01:10:06,898 --> 01:10:07,887
You're kidding?

1075
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:11,794
He said, ''When are you gonna start being a mom?''

1076
01:10:11,869 --> 01:10:12,893
Then she said:

1077
01:10:13,705 --> 01:10:17,801
''The question is, when are you gonna realize I have a bomb?''

1078
01:10:19,877 --> 01:10:21,811
Are you sure she didn't say:

1079
01:10:21,879 --> 01:10:26,816
''When are you gonna grow up and realize I am your mom?''

1080
01:10:28,986 --> 01:10:30,436
That makes more sense.

1081
01:10:30,436 --> 01:10:31,886
You think?

1082
01:10:33,725 --> 01:10:34,817
What's going on now?

1083
01:10:35,727 --> 01:10:39,629
I don't know. I've been standing here spelling it out for you.

1084
01:10:40,832 --> 01:10:42,732
I don't hear anything. Wait.

1085
01:10:42,834 --> 01:10:43,823
What do you see?

1086
01:10:44,635 --> 01:10:46,728
It's hard to tell. They're tiny and upside down.

1087
01:10:46,838 --> 01:10:47,862
Wait, wait, wait.

1088
01:10:48,673 --> 01:10:51,665
They're walking away. They're walking away.

1089
01:10:51,876 --> 01:10:55,744
No, they're not. They're coming right at us. Run!

1090
01:10:57,882 --> 01:10:59,315
Are you okay, kiddo?

1091
01:10:59,315 --> 01:11:00,748
Yeah, I'm okay.

1092
01:11:00,852 --> 01:11:02,752
All right. You be good.

1093
01:11:02,854 --> 01:11:04,685
Drive safe.

1094
01:11:06,691 --> 01:11:07,720
Mrs. Bing.

1095
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:08,749
Mr. Geller.

1096
01:11:17,769 --> 01:11:18,861
You mean that?

1097
01:11:19,804 --> 01:11:20,896
Yeah, why not?

1098
01:11:23,775 --> 01:11:25,766
So I told her.

1099
01:11:25,877 --> 01:11:26,844
How did it go?

1100
01:11:26,844 --> 01:11:27,811
Awful. Awful.

1101
01:11:27,979 --> 01:11:29,810
Couldn't have gone worse.

1102
01:11:30,882 --> 01:11:32,332
Well, how do you feel?

1103
01:11:32,332 --> 01:11:33,782
Pretty good.

1104
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:36,878
I told her.

1105
01:11:37,655 --> 01:11:38,849
Well, see?

1106
01:11:39,657 --> 01:11:43,718
So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, me kissing your mom, huh?

1107
01:11:43,828 --> 01:11:46,854
But we don't have to go down that road.

1108
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:59,837
This is just the first chapter and I want your absolute honest opinion. Okay?

1110
01:12:00,745 --> 01:12:04,738
And on page two, he's not reaching for her ''heaving beasts.''

1111
01:12:06,651 --> 01:12:07,948
She could have heaving beasts.

1112
01:12:08,853 --> 01:12:11,845
Right, but in this case she doesn't.

1113
01:12:12,757 --> 01:12:13,746
What's a ''niffle''?

1114
01:12:13,858 --> 01:12:16,793
You can usually find them on the heaving beasts.

1115
01:12:18,863 --> 01:12:20,888
Okay, so I'm not a great typist.

1116
01:12:21,699 --> 01:12:25,692
Did you get to the part about his ''huge, throbbing pens''?

1117
01:12:25,903 --> 01:12:29,862
You don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those.

1118
01:12:30,808 --> 01:12:32,799
That's it. Give them back.

1119
01:12:33,711 --> 01:12:37,841
Wait, I just got to the part about her ''public hair.''

1120
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:41,170
No, no, we're done!

1121
01:14:29,357 --> 01:14:32,155
Aunt Silv, stop yelling!

1122
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:37,389
If you'd told me vegetarian lasagna l would've made vegetarian lasagna.

1124
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:42,394
The meat's only every third layer. Maybe you could scrape.

1125
01:14:43,404 --> 01:14:46,339
Ross, did you really read all these baby books?

1126
01:14:47,141 --> 01:14:54,274
You could plunk me down in any woman's uterus, no compass and l could find my way out like that!

1128
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:56,306
This is cool.

1129
01:14:57,118 --> 01:15:01,214
It says in some parts of the world people eat the placenta.

1130
01:15:03,157 --> 01:15:05,216
And we're done with the yogurt.

1131
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:08,117
Sorry.

1132
01:15:08,329 --> 01:15:12,129
l did this as a favor. l am not a caterer.

1133
01:15:12,233 --> 01:15:15,327
What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas?

1134
01:15:16,237 --> 01:15:18,330
Nice talk, Aunt Silv.

1135
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,367
You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?

1136
01:15:22,376 --> 01:15:27,370
Ross, listen. Do you know that right now your baby is only this big?

1137
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:30,140
This is your baby. ''Hi, Daddy.''

1138
01:15:30,351 --> 01:15:31,340
Hello.

1139
01:15:32,186 --> 01:15:35,155
''How come you don't live with Mommy?''

1140
01:15:36,357 --> 01:15:39,349
''How come Mommy lives with that other lady?''

1141
01:15:44,231 --> 01:15:46,222
''What's a lesbian?''

1142
01:15:51,238 --> 01:15:53,297
Honey, you can say it. Poconos.

1143
01:15:53,407 --> 01:15:58,208
Poconos. It's like ''poke a nose.''

1144
01:16:00,214 --> 01:16:03,206
Poke a nose.

1145
01:16:11,325 --> 01:16:12,741
So did l hear Poconos?

1146
01:16:12,741 --> 01:16:14,157
Yes.

1147
01:16:14,261 --> 01:16:17,321
My sister's giving us her place for the weekend.

1148
01:16:18,132 --> 01:16:19,326
First weekend together.

1149
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:20,765
It's a big step.

1150
01:16:20,765 --> 01:16:22,164
l know.

1151
01:16:23,170 --> 01:16:25,218
It's just a weekend. Big deal.

1152
01:16:25,218 --> 01:16:27,266
Wasn't this supposed to be a fling?

1153
01:16:27,441 --> 01:16:31,276
Shouldn't it be flung by now?

1155
01:16:32,246 --> 01:16:34,237
We are way past a ''fling.''

1156
01:16:34,348 --> 01:16:38,341
I'm feeling things I've read about in Danielle Steel books.

1157
01:16:38,452 --> 01:16:41,353
When I'm with him, I'm just totally....

1158
01:16:42,123 --> 01:16:44,284
Nauseous. I'm physically nauseous.

1159
01:16:45,326 --> 01:16:49,126
What am l supposed to do? Call Immigration?

1160
01:16:50,131 --> 01:16:51,393
l could call Immigration.

1161
01:16:57,104 --> 01:16:58,196
What?

1162
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,141
Ugly Naked Guy is making shadow puppets.

1163
01:17:04,111 --> 01:17:05,408
Look, it's Abraham Lincoln.

1164
01:17:07,248 --> 01:17:08,340
Oh, right!

1165
01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:11,311
Go. Go!

1166
01:17:17,124 --> 01:17:24,354
l love babies with their little baby shoes and their little baby toes and their little hands....

1168
01:17:25,132 --> 01:17:28,260
Okay, you're gonna have to stop that. Forever.

1169
01:17:38,345 --> 01:17:40,142
Need a new table.

1170
01:17:40,381 --> 01:17:42,110
You think?

1171
01:17:49,223 --> 01:17:50,218
Come on in.

1172
01:17:50,218 --> 01:17:51,213
Hello.

1173
01:17:51,325 --> 01:17:57,127
l brought the books and Monica sends her love along with this lasagna.

1175
01:17:57,198 --> 01:18:01,191
Great! ls it vegetarian? Because Susan doesn't eat meat.

1176
01:18:03,237 --> 01:18:05,296
I'm pretty sure that it is.

1177
01:18:10,211 --> 01:18:14,113
Nineteen weeks, the breasts are starting to swell.

1178
01:18:15,216 --> 01:18:17,241
According to the literature.

1179
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:19,269
l got the results of the amnio.

1180
01:18:19,269 --> 01:18:21,220
Tell me. ls everything...?

1181
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:23,318
Totally and completely healthy.

1182
01:18:23,318 --> 01:18:25,314
That is great!

1183
01:18:31,131 --> 01:18:33,326
When did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?

1184
01:18:34,134 --> 01:18:36,125
That's our friend Tanya.

1185
01:18:45,279 --> 01:18:48,077
Of course, it's your friend Tanya.

1186
01:18:50,184 --> 01:18:52,152
Don't you wanna know about the sex?

1187
01:18:52,152 --> 01:18:54,120
The sex?

1188
01:18:55,289 --> 01:19:00,090
I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together.

1189
01:19:00,127 --> 01:19:02,186
But when you throw in Tanya....

1190
01:19:05,132 --> 01:19:07,225
The sex of the baby, Ross.

1191
01:19:09,303 --> 01:19:11,294
You know the sex of the baby?

1192
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:13,720
Want to know?

1193
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:14,300
No.

1194
01:19:15,109 --> 01:19:17,134
l don't want to. Absolutely not.

1195
01:19:17,211 --> 01:19:22,248
You shouldn't know until you look down there and see, ''Oh, there it is.''

1197
01:19:23,150 --> 01:19:24,310
Or isn't.

1198
01:19:27,254 --> 01:19:28,300
Hello, Ross.

1199
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:29,346
Susan.

1200
01:19:30,157 --> 01:19:31,124
So?

1201
01:19:31,358 --> 01:19:33,121
So did you hear?

1202
01:19:33,227 --> 01:19:35,218
Yes, we did. Everything's A-Okay.

1203
01:19:35,329 --> 01:19:38,127
Oh, that's so cool!

1204
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:40,325
It really is.

1205
01:19:41,168 --> 01:19:42,100
Do we know?

1206
01:19:42,269 --> 01:19:45,204
We certainly do. It's going to be a--

1207
01:19:45,272 --> 01:19:46,261
Hello?

1208
01:19:46,373 --> 01:19:50,207
A guy who doesn't wanna know is standing here.

1209
01:19:51,312 --> 01:19:54,304
Well, is it what we thought it would be?

1210
01:20:01,288 --> 01:20:03,119
What--?

1211
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:05,224
What did we think it'd be?

1212
01:20:06,193 --> 01:20:08,320
l don't wanna know. Don't wanna know.

1213
01:20:09,129 --> 01:20:10,323
l should probably just go.

1214
01:20:11,198 --> 01:20:12,762
Well, thanks for the books.

1215
01:20:12,762 --> 01:20:14,326
No problem. Okay.

1216
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:19,129
Susan.

1217
01:20:24,311 --> 01:20:29,112
Who should we call first? Your folks or Deb and Rhona?

1218
01:20:32,419 --> 01:20:34,148
Hello?

1219
01:20:36,223 --> 01:20:38,248
Never mind. I don't wanna know.

1220
01:20:39,326 --> 01:20:43,092
Because it was my table, l have to buy a new one?

1221
01:20:43,163 --> 01:20:45,131
That's the rule.

1222
01:20:45,131 --> 01:20:47,099
What rule? There's no rule.

1223
01:20:47,167 --> 01:20:48,731
You owe me a table.

1224
01:20:48,731 --> 01:20:50,295
How did you get there?

1225
01:20:51,071 --> 01:20:56,065
It was fine until your breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecio.

1226
01:20:56,210 --> 01:20:58,075
You knew about that?

1227
01:20:58,178 --> 01:21:02,205
The impressions in the butter left little to the imagination.

1228
01:21:03,183 --> 01:21:05,117
How about if we split it?

1229
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,616
What do you mean, buy it together?

1230
01:21:07,616 --> 01:21:09,112
Yeah.

1231
01:21:09,289 --> 01:21:11,302
Do you think we're ready for that?

1232
01:21:11,302 --> 01:21:13,315
Why not?

1233
01:21:14,094 --> 01:21:18,087
It's a big commitment. What if one of us wants to move out?

1234
01:21:18,132 --> 01:21:19,127
You're moving out?

1235
01:21:19,127 --> 01:21:20,122
I'm not.

1236
01:21:20,234 --> 01:21:21,280
You'd tell me if you were, right?

1237
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:22,326
Yes.

1238
01:21:23,103 --> 01:21:25,168
It's just, with my last roommate--

1239
01:21:25,168 --> 01:21:27,233
l know all about Kip.

1240
01:21:27,307 --> 01:21:32,301
We bought a hibachi, then he ran off and got married. Things got ugly.

1241
01:21:33,113 --> 01:21:37,311
Let me ask you something. Was Kip a better roommate than me?

1242
01:21:38,118 --> 01:21:39,346
Oh, don't do that.

1243
01:21:45,292 --> 01:21:48,056
There's changes in your schedule.

1244
01:21:48,095 --> 01:21:51,155
Your 4:00 herbal massage is at 4:0.

1245
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:54,190
And Miss Summerfield canceled her 5:0 shiatsu.

1246
01:21:54,301 --> 01:21:55,290
Thanks.

1247
01:21:56,170 --> 01:21:58,070
Oh, here comes your :00.

1248
01:21:58,205 --> 01:22:02,107
l don't mean to sound unprofessional, but-- Yum!

1249
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:09,172
Paolo! Hi! What are you doing here?

1250
01:22:11,185 --> 01:22:16,189
Rachella tell me you massage?

1252
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:19,115
Well, Rachella's right.

1253
01:22:24,097 --> 01:22:25,121
Oh, okay.

1254
01:22:25,232 --> 01:22:28,292
l don't know what you just said, so let's start.

1255
01:22:30,204 --> 01:22:34,197
l am...being naked?

1257
01:22:34,341 --> 01:22:38,209
That's your decision. Some people prefer to take off--

1258
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:41,305
Being naked!

1259
01:22:43,150 --> 01:22:47,143
l can't believe you don't wanna know. l couldn't not know.

1260
01:22:47,221 --> 01:22:50,156
If the doctor knows, Carol and Susan know--

1261
01:22:50,324 --> 01:22:52,121
And Monica knows.

1262
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:55,125
How? l don't even know.

1263
01:22:55,229 --> 01:22:58,323
Carol called to thank me for the lasagna. She told me.

1264
01:22:59,132 --> 01:23:00,360
So what's it gonna be?

1265
01:23:04,137 --> 01:23:06,202
Oh, great! Now he knows.

1266
01:23:06,202 --> 01:23:08,267
I'm just excited about being an aunt.

1267
01:23:08,342 --> 01:23:11,175
Or an uncle.

1268
01:23:15,282 --> 01:23:16,311
Hey, Phoebe.

1269
01:23:16,311 --> 01:23:17,340
Hey, Pheebs.

1270
01:23:17,384 --> 01:23:18,373
Fine!

1271
01:23:22,155 --> 01:23:23,753
What's the matter?

1272
01:23:23,753 --> 01:23:25,351
Nothing. I'm just out of sorts.

1273
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:29,361
Well, you can use some of my sorts. l rarely use them.

1274
01:23:30,163 --> 01:23:32,290
Can we get some cappuccino over here?

1275
01:23:34,201 --> 01:23:35,361
Oh, right! That's me!

1276
01:23:37,271 --> 01:23:40,263
That table place closes at 7. Come on.

1277
01:23:40,374 --> 01:23:41,398
Fine.

1278
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:44,334
What is it?

1279
01:23:46,146 --> 01:23:48,125
All right. You know Paolo?

1280
01:23:48,125 --> 01:23:50,104
I'm familiar with his work.

1281
01:23:51,218 --> 01:23:53,118
He made a move on me.

1282
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:54,784
The store will be open tomorrow.

1283
01:23:54,784 --> 01:23:56,348
More coffee, please.

1284
01:23:58,325 --> 01:24:00,122
Well, what happened?

1285
01:24:00,227 --> 01:24:04,220
He came in for a massage, and everything was fine until....

1286
01:24:08,335 --> 01:24:09,302
Oh, my God.

1287
01:24:09,302 --> 01:24:10,269
Are you sure?

1288
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:14,163
Oh, yeah. I'm sure.

1289
01:24:18,145 --> 01:24:22,138
And all of a sudden, his hands weren't the problem anymore.

1290
01:24:26,253 --> 01:24:27,242
Was it...?

1291
01:24:27,354 --> 01:24:30,346
Boy Scouts could've camped under there.

1292
01:24:34,294 --> 01:24:35,283
Wow.

1293
01:24:35,395 --> 01:24:37,329
What did you do?

1294
01:24:37,329 --> 01:24:39,263
l dealt with it like a professional.

1295
01:24:45,339 --> 01:24:47,204
''Ooh,'' what?

1296
01:24:47,307 --> 01:24:48,296
--ma Thurman.

1297
01:24:48,408 --> 01:24:49,756
The actress!

1298
01:24:49,756 --> 01:24:51,104
Uma Thurman!

1299
01:24:52,212 --> 01:24:53,201
Thanks, Rach.

1300
01:24:56,216 --> 01:24:57,262
What'll you do?

1301
01:24:57,262 --> 01:24:58,308
You have to tell her.

1302
01:24:58,352 --> 01:25:03,255
It's your moral obligation as a friend, as a woman. It's a feminist issue.

1303
01:25:03,323 --> 01:25:04,312
Guys?

1304
01:25:05,125 --> 01:25:06,672
You have to.

1305
01:25:06,672 --> 01:25:08,219
Feminist issue? That's where l went.

1306
01:25:10,263 --> 01:25:11,747
She is gonna hate me!

1307
01:25:11,747 --> 01:25:13,231
Yeah, well....

1308
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:23,138
Will you pick one? Just pick one.

1309
01:25:23,176 --> 01:25:25,172
Here, how about that one?

1310
01:25:25,172 --> 01:25:27,168
That's patio furniture.

1311
01:25:27,347 --> 01:25:32,182
So what? Like people will come in and think, ''Oh, I'm outside again.''

1312
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:33,241
Fine.

1313
01:25:34,154 --> 01:25:35,280
What about the birds?

1314
01:25:36,456 --> 01:25:41,359
l don't know. They don't say, ''Hello, sit here. Eat something.''

1315
01:25:42,329 --> 01:25:43,825
You pick one.

1316
01:25:43,825 --> 01:25:45,321
Okay. How about the ladybugs?

1317
01:25:46,133 --> 01:25:50,194
Forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining.

1318
01:25:50,303 --> 01:25:52,351
Fine! Want the birds? Get the birds!

1319
01:25:52,351 --> 01:25:54,399
Not like that, l won't.

1320
01:25:58,111 --> 01:26:00,204
Kip would have liked the birds.

1321
01:26:11,158 --> 01:26:12,153
Hi, Pheebs.

1322
01:26:12,153 --> 01:26:13,148
What's going on?

1323
01:26:13,226 --> 01:26:15,177
Are you moving out?

1324
01:26:15,177 --> 01:26:17,128
I'm getting ready for the weekend.

1325
01:26:18,331 --> 01:26:21,232
Are your weekends longer than two days?

1326
01:26:22,169 --> 01:26:24,137
These aren't all my suitcases.

1327
01:26:24,237 --> 01:26:25,329
This one's Paolo's.

1328
01:26:29,176 --> 01:26:31,155
Rachel, can we talk for a sec?

1329
01:26:31,155 --> 01:26:33,134
Well, sure.

1330
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:35,341
Just for a sec, Paolo's on his way.

1331
01:26:48,095 --> 01:26:50,290
We haven't known each other that long.

1332
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:53,231
There are three things you should know:

1333
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:58,134
One, my friends are the most important thing in my life.

1334
01:26:58,238 --> 01:27:00,206
Two, l never lie.

1335
01:27:01,141 --> 01:27:05,202
And three, l make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.

1336
01:27:07,314 --> 01:27:10,249
Okay. Thanks, Pheebs.

1337
01:27:15,322 --> 01:27:16,738
Oh, my God!

1338
01:27:16,738 --> 01:27:18,154
l know.

1339
01:27:18,258 --> 01:27:20,317
Why have l never tasted these?

1340
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:25,320
l don't make them a lot, because it's not fair to the other cookies.

1341
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:34,363
These are the best oatmeal raisin cookies.

1342
01:27:35,175 --> 01:27:36,756
Which proves that l never lie.

1343
01:27:36,756 --> 01:27:38,337
l guess you don't.

1344
01:27:39,246 --> 01:27:41,339
Paolo made a pass at me.

1345
01:27:44,084 --> 01:27:45,176
What do you think?

1346
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:48,187
It's the most beautiful table I've seen.

1347
01:27:48,288 --> 01:27:49,277
l know.

1348
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:52,285
Will you balance plates on these heads?

1349
01:27:53,093 --> 01:27:55,288
Who cares? We'll eat at the sink. Come on!

1350
01:27:58,098 --> 01:27:59,190
Heads up, Ross.

1351
01:27:59,299 --> 01:28:01,392
Score! You suck!

1352
01:28:05,138 --> 01:28:06,196
Are you okay?

1353
01:28:09,242 --> 01:28:10,334
l need some milk.

1354
01:28:12,312 --> 01:28:14,303
Okay. I've got milk.

1355
01:28:19,319 --> 01:28:21,116
Here you go.

1356
01:28:29,329 --> 01:28:31,126
Better?

1357
01:28:32,332 --> 01:28:33,356
No.

1358
01:28:36,236 --> 01:28:41,333
l feel so stupid! l think about the other day with you guys.

1359
01:28:41,374 --> 01:28:45,174
And l was all, ''Oh, Paolo! He's so great!

1360
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:47,178
He makes me feel so--''

1361
01:28:48,114 --> 01:28:49,172
God!

1362
01:28:50,083 --> 01:28:51,209
I'm so embarrassed!

1363
01:28:51,318 --> 01:28:53,183
I'm so embarrassed.

1364
01:28:53,286 --> 01:28:55,186
I'm the one he hit on.

1365
01:28:55,186 --> 01:28:57,086
l unleashed him on you.

1366
01:28:57,123 --> 01:28:59,091
If l had never met him--

1367
01:28:59,192 --> 01:29:00,187
I'm so sorry.

1368
01:29:00,187 --> 01:29:01,182
No, I'm sorry.

1369
01:29:01,294 --> 01:29:02,306
I'm sorry.

1370
01:29:02,306 --> 01:29:03,318
I'm sorry. Wait.

1371
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:05,210
What are we sorry about?

1372
01:29:05,210 --> 01:29:06,290
l don't know.

1373
01:29:06,399 --> 01:29:08,333
Right. He's the pig.

1374
01:29:09,135 --> 01:29:10,232
Such a pig!

1375
01:29:10,232 --> 01:29:11,329
Oh, God, he's such a pig!

1376
01:29:12,105 --> 01:29:15,233
He's like a big disgusting pig....

1377
01:29:15,342 --> 01:29:16,724
Pig man!

1378
01:29:16,724 --> 01:29:18,106
Yes, good!

1379
01:29:22,215 --> 01:29:25,207
But he was my pig man!

1380
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:28,310
How did l not see this?

1381
01:29:30,223 --> 01:29:31,247
Oh, l know!

1382
01:29:34,327 --> 01:29:38,126
Because he's gorgeous.

1384
01:29:38,231 --> 01:29:39,357
And he's charming.

1385
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:41,229
And when he looks--

1386
01:29:41,229 --> 01:29:42,292
Okay, Pheebs.

1387
01:29:43,069 --> 01:29:44,195
The end.

1388
01:29:47,073 --> 01:29:48,062
God.

1389
01:29:50,076 --> 01:29:52,067
Should l not have told you?

1390
01:29:52,312 --> 01:29:56,112
Trust me, it's much better that l know.

1391
01:29:59,219 --> 01:30:03,178
But l just liked it better before. It was better.

1392
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:24,099
She took it pretty well. Paolo's over there now, so....

1393
01:30:24,244 --> 01:30:28,305
We should go and see if she's okay. Just one second.

1394
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:31,196
Score!

1395
01:30:31,196 --> 01:30:32,242
Game! Nice!

1396
01:30:34,354 --> 01:30:36,117
Come on, Pheebs.

1397
01:30:37,324 --> 01:30:40,316
Well, it looks like we kicked your butts.

1398
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:45,059
She did. You could be on the Olympic ''Standing There'' team.

1399
01:30:45,098 --> 01:30:46,190
Come on. Two on one.

1400
01:30:46,299 --> 01:30:49,166
Why are you here? She just broke up with him.

1401
01:30:49,269 --> 01:30:51,362
It's time for you to swoop in.

1402
01:30:52,272 --> 01:30:53,722
What, now?

1403
01:30:53,722 --> 01:30:55,172
Yes. Now is when you swoop.

1404
01:30:55,208 --> 01:30:59,167
When Paolo walks out, you gotta be the first guy she sees.

1405
01:30:59,279 --> 01:31:04,182
She's gotta know you're everything he's not. You're the anti-Paolo.

1406
01:31:06,119 --> 01:31:08,087
My Catholic friend is right.

1407
01:31:08,188 --> 01:31:10,315
She's distraught. You're there for her.

1408
01:31:11,091 --> 01:31:16,324
You pick up the pieces and then you usher in ''The Age of Ross.''

1409
01:31:23,303 --> 01:31:24,753
See this? See?

1410
01:31:24,753 --> 01:31:26,203
Hold it! Ascolta!

1411
01:31:29,309 --> 01:31:30,304
How's it going?

1412
01:31:30,304 --> 01:31:31,299
Don't stare.

1413
01:31:31,344 --> 01:31:36,304
She threw his clothes off the balcony. Now there's gesturing and arm-waving.

1414
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:40,245
That is, ''How could you?'' or ''Enormous breasts!''

1415
01:31:42,255 --> 01:31:44,155
Here he comes.

1416
01:31:54,267 --> 01:31:58,100
l am to say goodbye.

1418
01:31:58,271 --> 01:32:00,102
Okay, bye-bye.

1419
01:32:03,276 --> 01:32:12,084
Paolo, l really hate you for what you did, but l still have five of these so heat it at 75 until the cheese bubbles.

1421
01:32:16,322 --> 01:32:21,316
l just wanna tell you, and l think I'd speak for everyone when l say....

1422
01:32:28,201 --> 01:32:30,135
Oh, just look at her.

1423
01:32:30,236 --> 01:32:34,185
Guys, l think only one of us should go so she's not overwhelmed.

1425
01:32:34,185 --> 01:32:35,231
Right.

1426
01:32:35,308 --> 01:32:38,141
And l really think it should be me.

1427
01:32:55,128 --> 01:32:56,220
You all right?

1428
01:32:57,230 --> 01:32:59,164
I've been better.

1429
01:33:00,266 --> 01:33:02,234
l don't believe this.

1430
01:33:03,169 --> 01:33:06,161
l wasn't supposed to care about this guy.

1431
01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:11,142
It was just supposed to be this big, fun, ltalian thing.

1432
01:33:11,377 --> 01:33:16,337
Someday l could look back and say, ''That was a big, fun, ltalian thing.''

1433
01:33:18,184 --> 01:33:21,381
It wasn't supposed to feel like this when it was over.

1434
01:33:24,257 --> 01:33:25,281
Come here.

1435
01:33:32,365 --> 01:33:37,259
Listen you deserve so much better than him.

1437
01:33:37,370 --> 01:33:44,109
l mean, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.

1439
01:33:47,347 --> 01:33:48,336
What?

1440
01:33:49,349 --> 01:33:52,250
I'm so sick of guys!

1441
01:33:53,219 --> 01:33:57,349
l don't want to look at or think about another guy.

1442
01:33:58,158 --> 01:34:01,150
l don't even want to be near another guy.

1443
01:34:08,168 --> 01:34:10,363
Ross, you're so great.

1444
01:34:22,248 --> 01:34:23,294
Are you all right?

1445
01:34:23,294 --> 01:34:24,340
Are you okay?

1446
01:34:25,151 --> 01:34:26,749
Medium. Any cookies left?

1447
01:34:26,749 --> 01:34:28,347
Yeah.

1448
01:34:31,391 --> 01:34:37,355
See, Rach l don't think swearing off guys altogether is the answer.

1450
01:34:38,164 --> 01:34:42,191
What you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.

1451
01:34:44,204 --> 01:34:46,399
l just need to be by myself for a while.

1452
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:48,721
l just gotta figure out what l want.

1453
01:34:48,721 --> 01:34:50,302
No, no.

1454
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:55,247
See, because not all guys out there are gonna be a Paolo.

1455
01:34:55,315 --> 01:34:57,306
No, l know. l know.

1456
01:34:57,350 --> 01:35:02,117
And I'm sure your little boy's not gonna grow up to be one.

1457
01:35:03,122 --> 01:35:04,117
What?

1458
01:35:04,117 --> 01:35:05,112
What?

1459
01:35:07,327 --> 01:35:09,124
I'm having a boy?

1460
01:35:10,129 --> 01:35:11,255
No.

1461
01:35:12,232 --> 01:35:15,326
No. In fact, you're not having a boy.

1462
01:35:16,236 --> 01:35:18,136
I'm having a boy.

1463
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:21,290
Huh? Am l having a boy?

1464
01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:23,241
You're having a boy!

1465
01:35:23,376 --> 01:35:25,139
I'm having a boy!

1466
01:35:25,245 --> 01:35:26,240
I'm having a boy!

1467
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:27,235
What is it?

1468
01:35:27,347 --> 01:35:30,180
I'm having a boy! I'm having a boy!

1469
01:35:34,153 --> 01:35:35,347
We already knew that!

1470
01:35:39,158 --> 01:35:40,352
I'm having a son.

1471
01:35:48,334 --> 01:35:51,235
Yes! And that would be a shutdown!

1472
01:35:51,304 --> 01:35:52,328
Shutout!

1473
01:35:56,209 --> 01:35:59,110
Where you going? One more game!

1474
01:35:59,145 --> 01:36:00,675
It's 2:0 in the morning.

1475
01:36:00,675 --> 01:36:02,205
Yeah, get out!

1476
01:36:02,415 --> 01:36:05,350
You guys always hang out in my apartment.

1477
01:36:06,152 --> 01:36:08,245
l'll only use my left hand.

1478
01:36:08,354 --> 01:36:10,322
Come on, wussies!

1479
