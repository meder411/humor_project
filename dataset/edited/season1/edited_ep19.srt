1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,359
Okay, I checked.

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:12,343
We have Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick Chamomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry and--

4
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:15,346
Wait, there's one more. Lemon Soother!

5
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:20,377
You're not the guy that asked for tea, are you?

6
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:15,239
Mail call! Rachel Greene, bunk seven.

7
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:16,467
Thank you.

8
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,338
Oh, cool! A free sample of coffee.

9
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:25,340
Oh, good. Because where else would we get any?

10
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:28,252
Oh, right.

11
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:30,855
Oh, great.

12
00:01:30,855 --> 00:01:32,254
What is it?

13
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,260
Country club newsletter.

14
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,263
My mother sends me the engagement notices for inspiration.

15
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,463
Oh, my God! It's Barry and Mindy!

16
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,498
Barry, who you almost--

17
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,466
And Mindy, your maid of--

18
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,374
Let me see. That's Mindy?

19
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:51,501
She is pretty!

20
00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:00,343
Lucky...to have had a friend like you.

22
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,448
Now it's quiet time.

23
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:12,331
Marcel, bring me the rice. Come on.

24
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,332
Good boy. Give me the rice.

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,265
Thank you. Good boy.

26
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:21,430
He's mastered the difference between ''bring me the'' and ''pee in the.''

27
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:27,245
''Bring me the'' and-- Rach?

28
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,475
Oh, I'm sorry.

29
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,384
This is so stupid!

30
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,477
I mean, I gave Barry up, right?

31
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,280
I should be happy for them.

32
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,258
I am. I'm happy for them.

33
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,859
Really?

34
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:43,258
No.

35
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:47,365
I guess it would be different if I were with somebody.

36
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,492
Whoa, what....

37
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:54,364
What happened to ''Forget relationships! I'm done with men!''

38
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,376
The whole penis embargo?

39
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,436
I don't know.

40
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:07,310
It's not about no guys. It's about the right guy.

41
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,413
With Barry it was safe and easy, but there was no heat.

42
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,319
With Paolo, all there was, was heat.

43
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,895
It was this raw, animal, sexual--

44
00:03:17,895 --> 00:03:20,329
Right. I got it.

45
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,326
I was there.

46
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,327
Do you think you can have both?

47
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:30,341
Someone who's your best friend but also can make your toes curl.

48
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,434
Yes.

49
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,343
Yes, I do. I really do.

50
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,546
In fact, it's funny.

51
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:49,257
Often, someone you wouldn't think could curl your toes might just be the one who...gets interrupted.

55
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,488
How was the movie?

56
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:51,861
Wonderful!

57
00:03:51,861 --> 00:03:52,458
So good!

58
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,381
Suck fest.

59
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:55,496
Total chick flick.

60
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:05,206
I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with guns and bombs and buses going really fast!

62
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:12,443
I don't need violence in a movie as long as there's a little nudity.

64
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,866
There was nudity.

65
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:16,413
I meant female nudity.

66
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:20,253
I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.

67
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,328
Hugh! Hugh Grant!

68
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,332
All right, I've got to go.

69
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,229
Come on, Marcel.

70
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:32,236
We're gonna go take a bath. Yes, we are, aren't we?

71
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,364
They're still just friends, right?

72
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,537
And I will see you tomorrow.

73
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,273
You're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's.

74
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,285
Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?

75
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,351
Please, Aunt Monica, please?

76
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,484
Unclench. You're not even gonna be here.

77
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:02,300
I can't believe we're discussing this.

78
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,235
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.

79
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:09,238
If it was gonna happen, wouldn't it have happened already?

80
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:14,210
She said she wants a relationship with someone exactly like me.

81
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,338
She said that?

82
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:19,214
I added the ''exactly like me'' part.

83
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:23,516
But she's looking for someone. And someone will be there tonight.

84
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,349
''Tonight'' tonight?

85
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,359
It's perfect. It'll just be the two of us.

86
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:32,330
She spent all day taking care of my monkey.

87
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:38,327
I can't remember the last time a girl took care of my monkey.

88
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:50,348
Anyway, I figured after work, I'd pick up some wine go over there and try to woo her.

90
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,349
Know what you should do?

91
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:57,480
Take her back to the 1890s when that phrase was last used.

92
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:05,387
If you keep this up, you'll be finished by the weekend.

93
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:09,292
The one in the feathered boa is Dr. Francis.

94
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:11,428
Now, she used to be a man.

95
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,429
Look, there's Raven.

96
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,334
We hate her. We're glad she's dying.

97
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:20,241
And then-- What? Marcel!

98
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:24,349
Are you playing with Monica's shoes? You're not supposed to--

99
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:30,320
Marcel, did you poo in the shoe?

100
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:33,257
Oh, Marcel! Bad monkey!

101
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,327
Oh, God!

102
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,367
Sorry, Barry.

103
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,227
A little engagement gift.

104
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,330
I'm sure you didn't register for that.

105
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,279
Who died? Who died?

106
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:01,184
Roll him over! Come on, roll him over!

107
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:06,282
Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right, Marcel? Because--

108
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:07,324
Marcel?

109
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,796
How could you lose him?

110
00:07:12,796 --> 00:07:14,195
I don't know!

111
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,396
We were watching TV, he pooped in Monica's shoe....

112
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,406
Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?

113
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,437
I don't know. The left one!

114
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,199
Which ones?

115
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:29,407
Those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything.

116
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,345
Why is the air in here so negative?

117
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,256
Rachel lost Marcel.

118
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,347
Oh, no! How?

119
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,421
He pooped in my shoe.

120
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:42,416
Which one?

121
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,254
The cute black ones I always wear.

122
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,355
No, which one?

123
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:50,266
The right or left?

124
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,427
Because the left one is lucky.

125
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,433
Come on! What am I gonna do?

126
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:58,369
All right. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city.

127
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,378
Where do you go?

128
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,411
It's his first time out, so he'll do touristy things.

129
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:11,418
I'll go to Cats. You go to the Russian Tea Room.

130
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,192
Oh, my God! Come on, you guys!

131
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,387
He'll be home any minute. He's gonna kill me!

132
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:22,224
Search the building. Take the first floor. We'll take the rest.

133
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,393
What am I gonna do?

134
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,330
You stay here and wait by the phone.

135
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:30,239
Spray Lysol in my shoe and wait for Ross to kill you.

136
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,436
Does anybody want to trade?

137
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,413
What do you want?

138
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:45,254
Mr. Heckles, have you seen a monkey?

139
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:48,418
I left a Belgian waffle out here. Did you take it?

140
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,324
Why'd you leave it in the hall?

141
00:08:51,324 --> 00:08:53,320
I wasn't ready for it.

142
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,434
Have you seen a monkey?

143
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,430
I saw Regis Philbin once.

144
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,372
Thank you, Mr. Heckles.

145
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,309
You owe me a waffle.

146
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:15,176
He's a black capuchin monkey with a white face with Russian dressing and pickles on the side.

148
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:16,277
Thanks.

149
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,316
How did it go today?

150
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:22,394
Oh, great! It went great. Really great.

151
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,224
Is that wine?

152
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:26,323
You want some?

153
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,299
Oh, I would love some.

154
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,199
But let's not drink it here.

155
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:34,432
I'm feeling crazy. You wanna go to Newark?

156
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:47,409
Okay, but before we head off to the murder capital of the Northeast I kind of wanted to run something by you.

158
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:53,357
You know how we were talking before about relationships, and stuff.

160
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,859
Oh, God, Ross, I cannot do this!

161
00:09:55,859 --> 00:09:58,259
Okay, quick and painful.

162
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,463
Oh, God!

163
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,276
Okay, all right. All right, okay.

164
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,368
Please don't hate me.

165
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,435
What?

166
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,350
You know Marcel?

167
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,349
I kind of lost him.

168
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:44,272
I can't believe this.

169
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:47,369
All I asked you to do was keep him in here!

170
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,469
I know. I'm sorry.

171
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,515
It's partially my fault.

172
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,478
I shouldn't have had you start with a monkey.

173
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:57,278
You should have started with a pencil.

174
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:02,225
I'm doing everything I can. Everyone's looking for him and I got--

175
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,264
-Who is it?
-Animal Control.

176
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,845
I've even got Animal Control.

177
00:11:08,845 --> 00:11:11,325
You called Animal Control?

178
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,240
Why? Do you not like them?

179
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:22,437
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.

180
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:30,545
I'm not allowed to have him. If they find him, they'll take him away.

181
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,384
Well, now, see, you never ever told us that.

182
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:39,354
Because I never expected you to invite them to the apartment!

183
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,267
Thanks for coming.

184
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,363
Somebody called about a monkey?

185
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:52,308
You know, that was a complete misunderstanding.

186
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,279
We thought we had a monkey, but we didn't.

187
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:56,298
Turned out it was a hat.

188
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,282
Cat!

189
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,218
We checked, no one's seen Marcel.

190
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,302
My uncle Marcel.

191
00:12:04,302 --> 00:12:06,350
Is that who the monkey's named after?

192
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:14,263
Possession of an illegal exotic is punishable by two years in prison and confiscation of the animal.

194
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,322
Oh, my God!

195
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:19,328
You'd put that poor little creature in jail?

196
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:29,271
Remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?

197
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:33,249
Yes, but there isn't always time.

198
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:40,257
I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this. Have a seat.

199
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,452
We haven't met. I'm Monica Geller.

200
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,456
Oh, my God, you are!

201
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,391
And you're Rachel Greene!

202
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,495
Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High?

203
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:55,398
I sat behind you guys in homeroom.

204
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:59,368
Luisa! Oh, my God!

205
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,412
Monica! It's Luisa!

206
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,408
I went there too!

207
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:07,515
Luisa! From homeroom!

208
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,452
You have no idea who I am, do you?

209
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:13,788
No.

210
00:13:13,788 --> 00:13:14,351
Not at all.

211
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:19,362
Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me.

212
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:26,233
Would it have been hard to say, ''Morning, Luisa'' or ''Nice overalls''?

214
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,273
Oh, I'm so sorry!

215
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:36,440
It's not so much you. You were fat. You had your own problems.

216
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,475
But you. What a bitch!

217
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,251
What?

218
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:50,553
You know what? Be that as it may could you help us with the monkey thing, for old times' sake?

220
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,265
Go, Bobcats!

221
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,457
I could. But I won't.

222
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:00,233
If I find that monkey, he's mine.

223
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,245
Sorry.

224
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,338
Marcel?

225
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:13,307
Marcel?

226
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,428
Hi, can I help you?

227
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:32,233
We're having an emergency, and we were looking for something.

228
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,369
A monkey.

229
00:14:34,369 --> 00:14:35,466
Yes, have you seen any?

230
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,369
No, I haven't seen a monkey.

231
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,435
Can you fix radiators?

232
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:44,347
Sure! Did you try turning the knob back the other way?

233
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,900
Of course!

234
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,350
Oh. Then, no.

235
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,453
Taste this. Is there too much rum?

236
00:14:53,453 --> 00:14:55,449
Just a second.

237
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:56,927
Hope you find your monkey.

238
00:14:56,927 --> 00:14:58,360
No, wait!

239
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:07,328
We may not know about radiators but we do have expertise in the heating and cooling milieu.

241
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,303
Aren't we in the middle of something?

242
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:17,314
But these women are very hot, and they need our help.

243
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,309
And they're very hot!

244
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,252
We can't, all right?

245
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,448
We're sorry.

246
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,524
You don't know how sorry. We promised to find this monkey.

247
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,322
He's this high and answers to the name Marcel.

248
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:37,461
So if we could get pictures of you, it'd help us out.

249
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:49,379
From now on, you don't get to talk to other people.

250
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:58,751
Oh, my God!

251
00:15:58,751 --> 00:15:59,245
What?

252
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,293
Something brushed up against my right leg.

253
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,287
Oh, it's okay. It was just my left leg.

254
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,427
Look, Phoebe!

255
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,392
Oh, Marcel! Come here!

256
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:13,330
Step aside, ladies.

257
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,736
What are you gonna do?

258
00:16:16,736 --> 00:16:18,232
Just a tranquilizer.

259
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,227
Run, Marcel, run!

260
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,317
Damn!

261
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:38,942
Are you okay?

262
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:40,455
I think so.

263
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,330
Oh, gosh!

264
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,379
We've been all over the neighborhood! He's just gone!

265
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,307
You don't know that.

266
00:17:07,307 --> 00:17:09,190
It's cold, it's dark.

267
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,287
He doesn't know the Village!

268
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:16,334
And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey and a broken foot!

269
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,198
Thank you very much!

270
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,205
I've said I'm sorry a million times.

271
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,206
What do you want me to do?

272
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:27,244
You want me to break my foot too? I'll break it right now.

273
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:30,440
Oh, my God! There, are you happy now?

274
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:38,348
Yeah, now that you kicked the sign I don't miss Marcel anymore!

276
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,359
It's not like I did this on purpose.

277
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,453
No, this is just vintage Rachel.

278
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,460
Things just sort of happen around you!

279
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:56,298
You're off in ''Rachel Land,'' doing your ''Rachel Thing'' oblivious to people's monkeys or to people's feelings and--

281
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,435
I don't want to hear it! Forget it, okay?

282
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,370
What?

283
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,411
Hey, banana man!

284
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,222
This is so intense!

285
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:20,288
One side of my butt is totally asleep and the other side has no idea.

286
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,851
What's with Phoebe?

287
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:26,500
Tranquilizer dart.

288
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,399
Hi! Did you order some bananas?

289
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,256
What about it?

290
00:18:32,256 --> 00:18:33,302
Give me my monkey back!

291
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,312
I don't have a monkey.

292
00:18:35,312 --> 00:18:37,212
Then what's with the bananas?

293
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,240
Potassium.

294
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,450
Okay, where is he?

295
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,451
You're wasting your time.

296
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,421
What?

297
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,369
What have you done to him?

298
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:05,365
That's my monkey. That's Patty.

299
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,280
Are you insane? Come here, Marcel.

300
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,374
Come here, Patty.

301
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,282
Come here, Marcel.

302
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:15,408
Come here, Patty.

303
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,416
Here, monkey.

304
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,279
Here, monkey!

305
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:21,291
Gotcha!

306
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:23,291
Give me my monkey back!

307
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,388
It's mine.

308
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,420
Take this up with the judge.

309
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:31,329
That's not my monkey. The dress is mine. Send it back whenever.

310
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,404
All right, I want my monkey!

311
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,972
Oh, come on, Luisa.

312
00:19:34,972 --> 00:19:36,439
Sorry, prom queen.

313
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:40,302
You had to be a bitch in school, instead of fat.

314
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:50,518
In high school, I was prom queen and the homecoming queen and you were also there.

317
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:55,415
But this isn't high school. We're all adults here!

318
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,458
Heckles! Can I have this?

319
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,262
For the most part.

320
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:05,463
If you take this monkey, I'll lose an important person in my life.

321
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,264
You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him.

322
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,435
You have a chance to be the bigger person here.

323
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,446
Take it!

324
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:19,472
No.

325
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:28,258
All right. Then I'll call your supervisor and tell her you shot my friend with a dart!

327
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:38,268
It'll be nice to get this off, won't it?

328
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,362
Or we can leave it on. That's fine.

329
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:45,502
With the right pumps, that would be a great little outfit.

330
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:53,477
Listen, I'm sorry I was so hard on you before--

331
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:57,282
No, it was my fault. I almost lost your--

332
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,517
Yeah, but you got him back. You were great.

333
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,527
We still have that bottle of wine.

334
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:13,227
Are you in the mood for something grape?

335
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,851
Sure, that would be good.

336
00:21:14,851 --> 00:21:16,364
All right.

337
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,443
The neighbors must be vacuuming.

338
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:43,268
Well, as long as we're here...and not on the subject....

340
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:52,266
I was thinking about...how mad we got at each other before.

342
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:59,280
And maybe it was partially because of how we--

343
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:00,433
Rachel?

344
00:22:00,433 --> 00:22:01,348
Barry?

345
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,321
I can't do it. I can't marry Mindy.

346
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,223
I think I'm still in love with you.

347
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:18,225
We have got to start locking that door!

348
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:27,336
Show us! Come on!

349
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,414
It was such a long time ago.

350
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,382
Okay, fine. All right.

351
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,477
This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?

352
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,256
That's because I'm in front of them.

353
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,258
Big nun!

354
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,257
I thought that was an alp.

355
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,355
High school wasn't my favorite time.

356
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,490
I loved high school.

357
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:52,464
It was four years of parties, dating and sex and--

358
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:56,365
Well, I went to boarding school with 400 boys.

359
00:22:56,475 --> 00:23:01,208
Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.

360
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:06,213
Doesn't it seem like a million years ago?

361
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:13,257
My butt cheek is waking up!
