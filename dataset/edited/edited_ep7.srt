00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:09,431
Everybody! Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.

3
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,277
Thanks.

4
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:21,446
I wanna start with a song that's about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is really all about.

6
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:24,352
Okay, here we go.

7
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:29,453
Okay. Thank you very much.

8
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,502
Oh, great. This is just--

9
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,498
This is so cool, you guys. The entire city's blacked out.

10
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:50,276
It's all of Manhattan. They have no idea when it's back on.

12
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:52,389
You guys, this is big.

13
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:54,402
Pants and a sweater. Why, Mom?

14
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,306
Who will I meet in a blackout?

15
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:01,353
Power-company guys? Eligible looters?

16
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,837
Can we talk about this later? Okay.

17
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:05,452
Can I borrow the phone?

18
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:09,354
I wanna call my apartment and check on my grandma.

19
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,226
What's my number?

20
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,433
I never call me.

21
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:20,329
Oh, my God! It's her. It's that Victoria's Secret model.

22
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,431
Something Goodacre.

23
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,334
Hi, Mom, it's Jill.

24
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:28,279
She's right. It's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh, my God!

25
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:32,284
I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre.

26
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,288
Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium.

27
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:40,358
Yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot.

28
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:45,387
I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank in an ATM vestibule.

29
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:49,492
Jill says vestibule, I'm going with vestibule.

30
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,263
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone.

31
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,372
I don't know, some guy.

32
00:02:56,476 --> 00:03:00,435
Oh, some guy. I am some guy.

33
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,409
Jill, I saw you with some guy last night.

34
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,412
Yes, he was some guy.

35
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,326
Hey, everyone.

36
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:28,230
Officiating at tonight's blackout is Rabbi Tribbiani.

37
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:35,441
Chandler's old roommate was Jewish. These are our only candles.

38
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,243
So happy Hanukkah!

39
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:42,446
Look! Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.

40
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,254
That had to hurt!

41
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:59,371
All right, all right! It's been 1 2 1 /2 minutes and you still haven't said one word. God!

43
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:03,203
Do something! Just make contact. Smile!

44
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,305
There you go.

45
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,309
You're definitely scaring her.

46
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,227
Hello? Oh, hi, Mom.

47
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,326
Mom.

48
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,329
Mom, you're tripping!

49
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:30,327
Dexter's a dog. The blackout's scaring him.

50
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,237
You'd pee in Dad's shoes too if you didn't know.

51
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,267
All right, call me back.

52
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:39,939
Mothers.

53
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:40,433
Yeah.

54
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,481
Attaboy! A word.

55
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,445
That wasn't so hard. Mothers. Yeah!

56
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,453
Mothers. Yeah! Perfect.

57
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,390
Don't smile.

58
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,552
Would you like to call somebody?

59
00:04:56,462 --> 00:05:00,228
Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with.

60
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,236
Yeah, thanks.

61
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:11,756
Hello?

62
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:12,302
It's me.

63
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,408
It's Chandler. Are you okay?

64
00:05:14,408 --> 00:05:16,404
Yeah, I'm fine.

65
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:25,247
I'm stuck in an ATM vestibule...with Jill Goodacre.

67
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:27,738
What?

68
00:05:27,738 --> 00:05:34,457
I'm stuck in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre.

71
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,532
I have no idea what you said.

72
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,239
Put Joey on the phone.

73
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,405
What's up, man?

74
00:05:44,405 --> 00:05:52,451
I'm stuck...in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!

77
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,442
Oh, my God!

78
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:58,348
He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!

79
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,317
Chandler, listen.

80
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,198
Like that thought never entered my mind.

81
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:12,699
Okay.

82
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:13,193
Somebody.

83
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:14,289
I'll go. I'll go.

84
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:15,239
Okay.

85
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:19,243
Senior year of college, on a pool table.

86
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:20,941
Pool table?

87
00:06:20,941 --> 00:06:22,437
That's my sister.

88
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:32,419
Okay, my weirdest place would have to be the women's room of the New York City Public Library.

90
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,456
Oh, my God! What were you doing in a library?

91
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,846
Pheebs, what about you?

92
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:41,461
Oh, Milwaukee.

93
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,366
It's a really weird place.

94
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,469
Ross?

95
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,375
Disneyland, 1 989. ''It's a small world after all.''

96
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,417
No way.

97
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:08,190
The ride broke down so Carol and I went behind those mechanical Dutch children.

99
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:12,390
We were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.

100
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,403
Let's see, that leaves....

101
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,887
Rachel?

102
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:20,337
Come on, I already went.

103
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:21,321
You did not go.

104
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:22,236
I did.

105
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,309
Tell us. Come on.

106
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:34,243
All right, the weirdest place would have to be...the foot of the bed.

108
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,837
Step back!

109
00:07:36,837 --> 00:07:38,253
We have a winner!

110
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:51,260
This must be what the fridge looks like with the door closed.

111
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,334
Spooky.

112
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,436
Anybody hungry? We got a IKlondike...soup.

113
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:03,280
I've never had a relationship with that kind of passion.

114
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:07,184
Where you have to have somebody even in a theme park.

115
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:13,386
It was the only thing to do that didn't have a line.

116
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:19,287
Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.

117
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:19,892
Come on.

118
00:08:19,892 --> 00:08:20,386
No.

119
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,300
He said we held up the people behind us.

120
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,294
You didn't marry him because...?

121
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:34,406
Do you think there are people that go through life never having that kind of...?

123
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,379
Probably.

124
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:36,311
Really?

125
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,475
I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.

126
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:40,833
Yeah, right.

127
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:41,413
It is.

128
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,321
Eventually, it kind of burns out.

129
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:49,417
But hopefully what you're left with is trust and security and....

130
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,453
In my ex-wife's case, lesbianism.

131
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:03,272
For those people who miss out on that passion thing there's other stuff.

133
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,841
Okay.

134
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:08,371
But I don't think that'll be you.

135
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,282
You don't?

136
00:09:11,282 --> 00:09:14,799
See, I see big passion in your future.

138
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,312
Really?

139
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:17,836
You do?

140
00:09:17,836 --> 00:09:18,382
I do.

141
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:22,227
Ross, you're so great.

142
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,229
It's never gonna happen.

143
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,242
What?

144
00:09:42,242 --> 00:09:43,237
You and Rachel.

145
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,313
What--? Me and Ra--?

146
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,416
Why not?

147
00:09:55,461 --> 00:10:01,333
You waited too long to make your move and now you're in the ''friend zone.''

149
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,448
I'm not in the zone.

150
00:10:04,448 --> 00:10:06,461
No, Ross. You're mayor of the zone.

151
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:13,242
Look, I'm taking my time, all right? I'm laying the groundwork.

152
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,281
Every day I get a little bit closer to--

153
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,373
Priesthood!

154
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:23,345
I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking.

155
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,483
She just ran her fingers through my hair.

156
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,874
Were you missing that interaction?

157
00:10:28,874 --> 00:10:30,455
No, no, no.

158
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:34,465
This is running fingers through your hair, okay?

159
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:38,293
Now this is a tousle.

160
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:44,366
If you don't ask her out soon, you'll be in the zone forever.

161
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,369
I will, I will. I'm waiting for the right moment.

162
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,375
What?

163
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,348
What, now?

164
00:10:54,348 --> 00:10:55,411
Yeah.

165
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,225
What's messing you up? The wine? The moonlight?

166
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:05,227
You gotta go up to her and say, ''Look, Rachel, I--''

167
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:07,863
What?

168
00:11:07,863 --> 00:11:12,369
We're shushing...because we're trying to hear something.

170
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:14,422
What? What?

171
00:11:14,422 --> 00:11:16,373
Don't you hear that?

172
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,536
See?

173
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,300
Would you like gum?

174
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,346
Is it sugarless?

175
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,371
Sorry, it's not.

176
00:11:34,371 --> 00:11:35,383
Then no, thanks.

177
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:36,450
What was that?

178
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:43,291
Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it.

179
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:47,498
If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it!

180
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:53,274
New York City has no power

181
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,507
And the milk is getting sour

182
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,318
But to me it is not scary

183
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,446
Because I stay away from dairy

184
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:14,796
Here goes.

185
00:12:14,796 --> 00:12:15,359
You'll do it?

186
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,366
I'll do it.

187
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:17,264
Want help?

188
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,361
You come out, you're a dead man.

189
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:23,808
Good luck, man.

190
00:12:23,808 --> 00:12:25,275
Thanks.

191
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,327
Okay.

192
00:12:30,327 --> 00:12:31,373
Okay.

193
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:38,287
Where you going? You can't go out there.

194
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,325
Why not?

195
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:42,293
Because of the reason.

196
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,379
That would be?

197
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:47,262
I can't tell you.

198
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,357
Joey, what's going on?

199
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:54,303
You gotta promise you'll never tell Ross that I told you.

200
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,840
What?

201
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,307
He's planning your birthday party.

202
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,808
Oh, my God! I love him!

203
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:02,338
You better act surprised.

204
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,813
About what?

205
00:13:03,813 --> 00:13:05,212
My surprise party.

206
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,285
What surprise party?

207
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:09,253
Oh, stop it. Joey already told me.

208
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,320
He didn't tell me.

209
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,522
Don't look at me. This is Ross' thing.

210
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:18,355
This is typical. I'm always the last to know.

211
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,421
You are not. We tell you stuff.

212
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:26,268
I was the last one to know when Chandler got bit by the peacock.

213
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,333
I was the last to know you had a crush on Joey.

214
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,365
What?

215
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,245
Looks like I was second to last.

216
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,442
You had a crush on me?

217
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:47,357
All right. It wasn't a crush, it was a dent.

218
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,554
Big dent?

219
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:55,359
You were moving your furniture. I thought you had nice arms.

220
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,396
Nice arms, huh?

221
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,208
Hey, Mon, I'm moving the chair.

222
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,403
Do anything for you?

223
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:13,242
With all the lights out you can actually see the stars.

224
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,252
It's so nice.

225
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,358
I have a question.

226
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:26,230
Actually, it's not so much a question.

227
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,459
It's more of a general wondering....

228
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,459
--ment.

229
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,449
Okay.

230
00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:35,428
Okay. Here it goes.

231
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:42,245
Well, for a while now, I've been wanting to....

232
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,397
Yes, that's right.

233
00:14:45,397 --> 00:14:47,445
Look at that little kitty!

234
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,378
What?

235
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:56,250
Top of the world Looking down on creation

236
00:14:56,295 --> 00:15:00,288
And the only explanation I can find

237
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:08,197
Is the love that I found Ever since you've been around

238
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,256
All right, this is just Bactine. It won't hurt.

239
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,806
Ow!

240
00:15:28,806 --> 00:15:30,353
Sorry, that was wax.

241
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:36,264
Poor little Tooty's scared. We should find his owner.

242
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,428
Why not put poor Tooty in the hall?

243
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:42,439
During a blackout? She'll get trampled.

244
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,271
Yeah?

245
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:49,447
Damage control. Get back to the gum.

246
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,477
Gum would be perfection.

247
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,278
Gum would be perfection?

248
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,446
Gum would be perfection.

249
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:02,386
Could've said, ''Gum would be nice. '' But, no.

250
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:06,330
For me, gum is perfection.

251
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:10,292
I loathe myself!

252
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:15,430
Oh, no, they're nuns. They hate all living things.

253
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:26,248
Hi. We just found this cat, and we're looking for the owner.

254
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,411
Yeah, it's mine.

255
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,354
He seems to hate you. Are you sure?

256
00:16:32,354 --> 00:16:34,453
It's my cat. Give me my cat.

257
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,378
Wait a minute. What's his name?

258
00:16:37,378 --> 00:16:39,329
Bob-- Buttons.

259
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,400
Bob Buttons?

260
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,334
Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.

261
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,431
You are a very bad man!

262
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,241
You owe me a cat.

263
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,441
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

264
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,381
Here, kitty, kitty.

265
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,478
Where did you go, little kitty?

266
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:08,257
Kitty, kitty, kitty. Come here, kitty, kitty.

267
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,496
-Hi.
-Buona sera.

268
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,393
Wow!

269
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,234
Mon, wanna go for a ride in my racecar?

270
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,279
I'll bring my arms.

271
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,342
We can bring my wheelbarrow for your teeth!

272
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,255
Come on, lucky sixes!

273
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,418
Everybody, this is Paolo.

274
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:45,422
Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica...

275
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,448
Hi.

276
00:17:46,448 --> 00:17:47,432
...and Joey...

277
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:48,950
Hi.

278
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,434
...and Ross.

279
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,294
Hi.

280
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,178
He doesn't speak much English.

281
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,215
Monopoly!

282
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,248
Look at that!

283
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,188
So, where did Paolo come from?

284
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,419
Italy, I think.

285
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:18,390
No, I mean tonight. Suddenly, into our lives.

286
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:24,234
That cat turned out to be Paolo's cat. Isn't that funny?

287
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:29,305
That is funny. And Rachel keeps touching him.

288
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:36,237
I looked all over and couldn't find the kitty anywhere.

289
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,442
I found him. It was Paolo's cat.

290
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,352
Well, there you go. Last to know again.

291
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:47,222
And I'm guessing, this is Paolo?

292
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,361
Paolo, this is Phoebe.

293
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,425
You betcha!

294
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,297
All right. Okay. What next?

295
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:07,178
Blow a bubble. A bubble's good.

296
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:10,181
It's got a boyish charm. It's impish.

297
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,307
Here we go.

298
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,394
Nice going, imp!

299
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:32,398
It's okay. All I need to do is reach over and put it back in my mouth.

301
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:41,335
Good save! We're back on track and I'm chewing someone else's gum.

303
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:46,316
This is not my gum! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

304
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:48,446
And now you're choking.

305
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,255
You all right?

306
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,317
My God! You're choking!

307
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,800
Better?

308
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,267
Yes.

309
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,234
Thank you. That was....

310
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:07,904
That was....

311
00:20:07,904 --> 00:20:09,337
Perfection?

312
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,295
That was no tousle.

313
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,767
What'd he say that was so funny?

314
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:43,264
I have absolutely no idea.

315
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,276
That's classic.

316
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:49,370
My God, you guys! What am I doing? This is so un-me!

317
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,473
If you want, I'll do it.

318
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:56,286
I just wanna bite his bottom lip.

319
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,381
But I won't.

320
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:06,220
The first time he smiled at me those seconds were more exciting than weeks with Barry.

322
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,423
Did you rent mopeds?

323
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:14,337
Because I've heard-- Oh, it's not about that right now.

324
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:22,470
I know it's superficial, and we have nothing in common and we don't even speak the same language, but, God!

326
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,902
Paolo, hi.

327
00:21:28,902 --> 00:21:30,352
Ross.

328
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,387
Listen....

329
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:38,454
Listen, something you should know.

330
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:42,296
Rachel and I are....

331
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,300
We're kind of a thing.

332
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,886
Thing?

333
00:21:46,886 --> 00:21:48,302
Thing. Yes, thing.

334
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,986
You have the sex?

335
00:21:49,986 --> 00:21:51,499
No.

336
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:57,505
No, technically the sex is not being had. But that's....

337
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,451
But that's not the point.

338
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:05,417
The point is that Rachel and I should be....

339
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:09,250
Well, Rachel and I should be together.

340
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,319
And if you get in the--

341
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,380
In bed--

342
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,330
No.

343
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,461
No, not where I was going.

344
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:25,274
If you get in the way of us becoming a thing then I would be, well, very sad.

346
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,370
So, do you...?

347
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:36,300
So you do know a little English?

348
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,348
Little.

349
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,357
Do you know the word ''crap-weasel''?

350
00:22:40,357 --> 00:22:42,257
No.

351
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,491
That's funny. You are a huge crap-weasel.

352
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:54,497
We've been doing this for an hour. It's easy.

353
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,365
Ready?

354
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,412
Okay? Now try it.

355
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,316
You gotta whip it.

356
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:14,224
Look, look. The last candle's about to burn out.

357
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:23,367
Ten, nine, eight, seven minus 46, minus 47, minus 48....

359
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,264
Thank you.

360
00:23:25,264 --> 00:23:26,259
Thanks.

361
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:30,432
Kind of spooky without any lights.

362
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:40,383
Okay, guys, I have the definitive one.

363
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:59,566
This probably isn't the best time to bring it up but you have to throw a party for Monica.

365
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:08,810
This has been fun.

366
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:09,407
Yes.

367
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:15,413
Thanks for letting me use your phone...and for saving my life.

369
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:20,450
Well, goodbye, Chandler. I had a great blackout.

370
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,251
See you.

371
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:42,436
Hi, I'm account number 71 43457.

372
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,472
I don't know if you got that...

373
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,276
...but I would really like a copy of the tape.
