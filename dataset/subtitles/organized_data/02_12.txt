727,778,0,ROSS,That commercial always makes me so sad.
781,920,1,JOEY,Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.
925,996,0,ROSS,I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
1015,1212,0,PHOEBE,I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.   MONICA  And the fact that they're both monkeys.
1236,1306,1,ROSS,Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.
1308,1499,0,RACHEL,Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.
1567,1784,1,ROSS,Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.
1786,1978,1,CHANDLER,Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem.
3149,3200,0,JOEY,Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.
3201,3244,1,CHANDLER,Rhythm?
3269,3316,0,JOEY,No, my first fan mail.
3366,3729,0,MONICA,'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'
3774,3846,1,RACHEL,Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married.
3897,4052,0,MONICA,This wasn't addressed to _Days of Our Lives_, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.

4541,4568,0,PHOEBE,Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?
4586,4754,0,ROSS,Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.
4755,4928,1,CHANDLER,You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.
4994,5047,0,RACHEL,Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.
5090,5259,0,PHOEBE,Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.

5597,5647,0,PHOEBE,Oh, wow.
5648,5861,0,ROB,Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?
5881,6099,1,PHOEBE,Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them.
6147,6192,0,JOEY,Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?
6195,6243,0,CHANDLER,Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves.
6385,6410,1,CHANDLER,Hello.
6410,6435,0,ERICA,It's Erica.
6438,6481,0,JOEY,Ah, the stalker.
6484,6509,0,ERICA,Never mind, it's open.
6577,6725,1,CHANDLER,Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.
6769,6797,1,JOEY,Let's get out of here.
6870,6918,0,CHANDLER,The one time they're not home.
6963,7184,1,JOEY,OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.   CHANDLER  That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
7224,7252,1,JOEY,She's comin'.
7396,7439,1,ERICA,It's me.
7444,7562,0,JOEY,Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?

8090,8236,1,LIPSON,Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question.
8258,8403,0,ROSS,Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.
8425,8550,0,LIPSON,Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.
8596,8664,0,ROSS,Oh my God, what happened?
8666,8832,0,LIPSON,Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died.
8901,8928,1,ROSS,I can't believe this.
8931,9290,1,LIPSON,I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.
9309,9336,0,ROSS,Well, ya know, someone should have called me.
9336,9502,0,LIPSON,I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.
9531,9574,0,ROSS,Zoo dollars?
9577,9791,1,LIPSON,Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.
10006,10032,0,PHOEBE,I know.
10058,10175,1,MONICA,I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like.
10177,10244,0,CHANDLER,Well, you remember Cathy Bates in _Misery_?
10246,10319,1,CHANDLER,Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.
10343,10390,0,RACHEL,And she's not crazy?
10393,10558,0,CHANDLER,Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.
10561,10604,1,RACHEL,Oh my God.
10606,10700,0,MONICA,Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.
10702,11064,0,CHANDLER,Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.
11091,11132,1,ROB,You OK?
11134,11256,0,PHOEBE,No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.
11276,11371,1,ROB,That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired.
11468,11851,1,PHOEBE,I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?

19699,19884,0,ROB,The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals.
19887,19912,0,PHOEBE,I can do that.
19932,19980,0,ROB,Really?
