24761,24798,Yay me
24803,24868,So so how did it happen
24870,24941,Well I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on
24942,24967,And what did he say
24969,25401,He said that um he understands how sex can be like a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gon na get all y'know like ohh is he gon na call me the next day and y'know where is this going and ya know blah-la-la-la-la So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious
25420,25432,Wow
25432,25953,Yeah so I said OK relax please y'know I mean sex can be just about two people right there in the moment y'know it 's if he wants to see me again he can call and if not that 's fine too So after a looooot of talking I convinced him
26045,26354,Let me get this straight He got you to beg to sleep with him he got you to say he never has to call you again and he got you thinking this was a great idea
