1
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,430
Ross kissed me.

2
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:09,271
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

3
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:14,245
-It was unbeIievabIe.
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

4
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:18,340
Let's hear everything.
Get the wine and unpIug the phone.

5
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:22,285
Does this end weII
or do we need to get tissues?

6
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,448
It ended very weII.

7
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:29,292
Do not start without me!
Do not start without me!

8
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:34,356
Let's hear about the kiss.
Was it a soft brush against your Iips?

9
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:38,269
Or was it a ''I gotta have you now''
kind of thing?

10
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:42,398
At first it was reaIIy intense,
you know? And then....

11
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:46,309
Oh, God. And then we just
sort of sunk into it.

12
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,281
Was he hoIding you?
Or were his hands on your back?

13
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:53,479
No, actuaIIy,
first they started out on my waist...

14
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:57,518
...then they sIid up
and they were in my hair.

15
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:03,360
-And then I kissed her.
-Tongue?

16
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,455
-Yeah.
-CooI.

17
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,224
The One With the List

18
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,573
AII right, check out this bad boy.

19
00:01:55,315 --> 00:02:00,343
1 2 megabytes of RAM, 500-megabyte
hard drive, spreadsheet capabiIities...

20
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,254
...and a modem that transmits
at over 28,000 bps.

21
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,450
What are you gonna use it for?

22
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,455
Games and stuff.

23
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,365
There are no jobs.
There are no jobs for me.

24
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,424
Oh, wait, here's one.

25
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:20,332
-Are you wiIIing to cook naked?
-There's an ad for a naked chef?

26
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:25,333
No. But if you'II cook naked, then
you might be wiIIing to dance naked.

27
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,436
And then....

28
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,352
So, how'd you make out Iast night?

29
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:40,449
That's funny. That is painfuIIy funny.
No, wait, wait.

30
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,354
Yeah, that's just painfuI.

31
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:46,456
Wait a minute.
I thought Iast night was great.

32
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:52,267
It was. But I get home and I see
JuIie's saIine soIution on my tabIe...

33
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,498
...and I think, ''What am I doing?''

34
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:59,371
Here I am with JuIie, this incredibIe
woman, who I care about...

35
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:03,246
...and cares about me
and I'm throwing it aII away?

36
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,443
You got aII that from saIine soIution?

37
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:12,452
I'm the same way. Show me a bottIe
of Visine and I'm Iike, ''Who am I?''

38
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:17,226
Wait. We're taIking about RacheI.
You and RacheI.

39
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:22,267
I've dreamed of me and RacheI
for 10 years, but now I'm with JuIie.

40
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,270
It's Iike, me and JuIie,
me and RacheI.

41
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,362
Me and JuIie, me and Rach--

42
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,332
RacheI. RacheI.

43
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,434
-Hey, you.
-How are you?

44
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,537
-Good. How are you?
-Good.

45
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,375
-Hi, honey.
-Hi, JuIie. Hi, JuIie?

46
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:40,344
JuIie!

47
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,285
How are you?

48
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,482
-Good.
-Good.

49
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,351
So everybody's here.

50
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,485
Everybody's good.

51
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,558
Good and great and here.

52
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:57,265
Were you gonna pIay something?

53
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,395
-WeII, actuaIIy--
-PIay it.

54
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,399
AII right.

55
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,406
-JuIie, I didn't know you wore Ienses.
-What?

56
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,408
Okay. Hi.

57
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,343
HeIIo. Hi. Okay.

58
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,223
This is a song about a Iove triangIe...

59
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:20,451
...between three peopIe
that I made up.

60
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:27,322
It's caIIed
''Two of Them Kissed Last Night.''

61
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:33,269
<i>There was a girl</i>
<i>We'll call her Betty</i>

62
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:36,433
<i>And a guy</i>
<i>Let's call him Neil</i>

63
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:41,336
<i>Now I can't stress</i>
<i>This point too strongly</i>

64
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:44,373
<i>This story isn't real</i>

65
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:51,446
<i>Now our Neil must decide</i>
<i>Who will be the girl he casts aside?</i>

66
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,392
<i>Will Betty be the one</i>
<i>Who he loves truly?</i>

67
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,487
<i>Or will it be the one</i>
<i>Who we'll call Loolie?</i>

68
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,394
<i>He must decide</i>
<i>He must decide</i>

69
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:08,237
<i>Even though I made him up</i>
<i>He must decide</i>

70
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:16,204
WeII, this is a nice résumé.
Nice, nice, nice.

71
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,408
<i>Muy impressivo.</i>

72
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,253
Shame none of it's true.

73
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,314
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

74
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:29,452
No, it's aII true. Just a IittIe
nervous, that's aII. I'm fine now.

75
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:35,257
Mr. Rastatter, what does this job
entaiI? The ad wasn't too cIear.

76
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,236
-MockoIate.
-I'm sorry?

77
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:42,332
MockoIate.
It's a synthetic chocoIate substitute.

78
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:49,337
Go ahead, try a piece. We think
MockoIate is better than chocoIate.

79
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,350
AII right.

80
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,188
I Iove how it crumbIes.

81
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:05,492
-ChocoIate doesn't do that.
-No, ma'am.

82
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:10,326
We shouId be getting
our FDA approvaI any day now.

83
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,301
HopefuIIy, in time for Thanksgiving.

84
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:16,239
The way we see it,
chocoIate dominates...

85
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:21,211
...your major food-preparation
hoIidays: Easter, Christmas.

86
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,305
Given the right marketing...

87
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:27,308
...we can make Thanksgiving
the MockoIate hoIiday.

88
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,409
Wow.

89
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,448
Aren't you gonna swaIIow that?

90
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,419
Waiting for it to stop bubbIing.

91
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,429
Yeah. Isn't that great?

92
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:43,424
Anyhow, we're Iooking for chefs
who can create Thanksgiving recipes.

93
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,261
You interested?

94
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,465
AbsoIuteIy.

95
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:55,439
I Iove creating new recipes and
Thanksgiving. And now I Iove MockoIate.

96
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,238
ReaIIy?

97
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:59,478
EspeciaIIy the aftertaste.
I teII you...

98
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,380
...that'II Iast you tiII Christmas.

99
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,226
How about MockoIate mousse?

100
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,386
It's not very Thanksgiving-y.

101
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,393
How about PiIgrim MockoIate mousse?

102
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,427
What makes it PiIgrim?

103
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,328
We'II put buckIes on it.

104
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:26,208
-Did Ross caII?
-No, I'm sorry.

105
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:30,238
Why didn't he caII?
He's gonna stay with JuIie, isn't he?

106
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:34,446
He'II stay with her and she'II be,
''Hi, I'm JuIie. Ross picked me.

107
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:39,452
We'II get married and have kids
and dig up stuff together!''

108
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:44,458
No offense,
but that sounds nothing Iike her.

109
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:50,358
What am I gonna do?
This is Iike a compIete nightmare.

110
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:55,430
I know. This must be so hard.
''Oh, no. Two women Iove me.

111
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:59,439
They're both gorgeous,
my waIIet's too smaII for my 50s...

112
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,380
...and my diamond shoes
are too tight.''

113
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:07,375
-Here's a thought--
-Don't ever touch the computer.

114
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,290
Ross, Iisten.
I got two words for you:

115
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,290
Threesome.

116
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:22,197
You stiII have another word,
if you wanna use it.

117
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:25,395
Oh, hey. I think I know what it is.
HeIp.

118
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,503
Let's get IogicaI about this.
Make a Iist.

119
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,302
RacheI and JuIie: Pros and Cons.

120
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,340
We'II put their names
in different fonts.

121
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,318
I can use coIors for each coIumn.

122
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:45,256
-Can't we just use a pen?
-No, Amish boy.

123
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:51,429
Let's start with the cons because
they're more fun. RacheI first.

124
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,366
I don't know. I mean....

125
00:08:55,468 --> 00:09:00,269
AII right, I guess you can say
she's a IittIe spoiIed sometimes.

126
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,397
You couId say that.

127
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:08,270
I guess, sometimes
she's a IittIe ditsy, you know?

128
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:12,182
And I've seen her be
a IittIe too into her Iooks.

129
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:17,279
JuIie and I have a Iot in common
because we're both paIeontoIogists.

130
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,381
RacheI's just a waitress.

131
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,222
Waitress.

132
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:24,421
Got it.
You guys wanna pIay Doom?

133
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,200
Or we couId keep doing this.

134
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,497
What eIse?

135
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,500
I don't know.

136
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,504
Oh. Her ankIes are a IittIe chubby.

137
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,404
Okay, Iet's do JuIie.
What's wrong with her?

138
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,412
She's not RacheI.

139
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,258
This is pumpkin pie
with a MockoIate crust.

140
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:57,228
MockoIate cranberry cake,
and MockoIate chip cookies.

141
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,355
Just Iike the Indians served.

142
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:05,266
-Oh, my God.
-''Oh, my God'' good?

143
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:09,274
Oh, my God, I can't beIieve
you Iet me put this in my mouth.

144
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,439
Sweet Lord!
This is what eviI must taste Iike.

145
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,444
I'm teIIing you,
this thing won't print.

146
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:28,484
Yes, I pressed that button 100 times.
For a hot Iine, you're not so hot.

147
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,253
What's in the background?

148
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,493
Are you watching <i>Star Trek</i>?

149
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:44,407
-So did you break JuIie's heart?
-Yes.

150
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:50,382
It was horribIe. She cried, I cried.
She threw things, they hit me.

151
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,382
I did the right thing.

152
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:57,422
So Spock actuaIIy hugs his father?

153
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,258
Hey, do you guys have--?

154
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,224
Where you going?

155
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,357
I just got back...

156
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,334
...from JuIie's.

157
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:16,237
No, no. It's not what you think.

158
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,368
It's the other thing.

159
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:29,284
WeII, what's the other thing?
What do I think?

160
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,382
WeII....

161
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,358
He broke up with JuIie.

162
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:38,295
WeII, go hug her, for God's sakes.

163
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,290
-ReaIIy?
-ReaIIy.

164
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:46,465
-It's aIways been you, Rach.
-Oh, God.

165
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,418
Oh, this is good.
This is reaIIy good.

166
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,513
I know, I know. It's aImost....

167
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:13,262
What do you say we take a waIk?
Just us. Not them.

168
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:16,358
-Let me get my coat.
-Okay. No, hey.

169
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,268
I'II get your coat.

170
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:28,538
He's going to get my coat, Joey.

171
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:33,375
You guys, I can't beIieve this.
This is unbeIievabIe.

172
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:36,444
-What's that?
-What? Nothing!

173
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,384
-I saw my name. What is it?
-No, no. See? See?

174
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,451
Hey, it's printing.

175
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:46,292
Hey, it's printing!

176
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:50,262
-Let me see.
-Someone order a coat?

177
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:53,465
He wrote something about me
and won't Iet me see.

178
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,497
He won't? He won't.

179
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:02,311
Because isn't that...
the short story you were writing?

180
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:06,316
Yes, it is a short story
that I was writing.

181
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,343
I'm in it? Let me read it.

182
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,251
No!

183
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:16,456
-Come on.
-Hey, why don't you read it to her?

184
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,335
AII right.

185
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,477
''It was summer.

186
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,477
And it was hot.

187
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,549
RacheI was there.

188
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,261
A IoneIy gray couch.

189
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,365
'Oh, Iook!' cried Ned.

190
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:59,403
And then the kingdom was his forever.
The end.''

191
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:06,235
That's it?
You're the worst writer in the worId.

192
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,246
This isn't funny anymore.

193
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:12,307
There's something about me
on that paper. I want to see it.

194
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,318
No, you don't.

195
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:20,214
AII right. If you guys want
to be chiIdren, that's fine.

196
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,351
I do not need to see it.

197
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:31,426
-What is this?
-That is....

198
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:33,427
What is this?

199
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:36,339
-Thank you.
-Good Iuck.

200
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:42,345
Okay. Just remember how crazy
I am about you, okay?

201
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:48,342
''Kind of ditsy''? ''Too into her Iooks''?
''SpoiIed''?

202
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:52,447
That's a IittIe spoiIed.
He was supposed to type ''IittIe.''

203
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,393
''Just a waitress''?

204
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,486
Now, that was....

205
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,392
I mean, as opposed to....

206
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,199
Okay, is this over yet? Rach?

207
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:09,237
I do not have chubby ankIes!

208
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,332
No. I--

209
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,402
Look at the other side.
Look at JuIie's coIumn.

210
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,347
''She's not Rachem''?

211
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,213
What's a Rachem?

212
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:24,221
A stupid paIeontoIogy word I wouIdn't
know because I'm just a waitress.

213
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,414
Rach, come on.

214
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:32,423
It's ''She's not RacheI''!
She's not....

215
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,233
RacheI?

216
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,432
My diary. BriIIiant.

217
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:45,432
If I said it was my diary,
she wouIdn't have made me read it.

218
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:51,273
True. You'd be a great person
to have around after an emergency.

219
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,283
I cannot beIieve Ross made this Iist.

220
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:57,355
-I know.
-What a dinkus.

221
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,282
Cut him some sIack.
It was ChandIer's idea.

222
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,224
What?

223
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,389
Oh, good. I was hoping
that wouId come up.

224
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,297
This was your idea?

225
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:12,498
Let's get some perspective here.
These things happen for a reason.

226
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,229
Yeah. You.

227
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:20,337
Pheebs, back me up. You beIieve
in that karma crap, don't you?

228
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:25,342
Good Iuck in your next Iife
as a dung beetIe.

229
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,460
Rach.

230
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,431
Open up, pIease?

231
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,533
When somebody does not buzz you in,
that means, ''go away''...

232
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,337
...not, ''cIimb up the fire escape.''

233
00:16:55,447 --> 00:17:01,386
-I want to read you your pro Iist.
-Not interested.

234
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,186
''Number one:
the way you cry at game shows.

235
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:09,192
Number two:
how much you Iove your friends.

236
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:13,255
Number three: how you pIay
with your hair when you're nervous.

237
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:17,291
Number four: how brave you are
for starting Iife over.

238
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:20,395
Number five:
how great you are with Ben.

239
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,300
Number six: the way you smeII.''

240
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:29,210
-What are you doing?
-Want to open the window?

241
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,441
Oh, yeah.

242
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,214
What are you doing out there?

243
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:37,222
You must be freezing.
Know what you need?

244
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:40,419
How about a steaming cup
of hot MockoIate?

245
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,456
Come on, open up.

246
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,224
Come on.
You gotta give me another chance.

247
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,237
No.

248
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:54,295
-No?
-That's what I said.

249
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:57,536
-We shouId go.
-You don't have to go. We're done.

250
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:01,371
-I know how you must--
-No, you don't, Ross.

251
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:06,183
Imagine the worst things
you think about yourseIf.

252
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:10,381
How wouId you feeI if the person
you trusted most in the worId...

253
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,322
...not onIy thinks them...

254
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:16,384
...but actuaIIy uses them
as reasons not to be with you.

255
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:21,297
No, but see, I want to be with you
in spite of aII those things.

256
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:26,432
WeII, that's mighty big of you, Ross.
I said, don't go.

257
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,204
You know what?

258
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:36,237
If it were the other way, there
is nothing you couId put on a Iist...

259
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:39,307
...that wouId make me
not wanna be with you.

260
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,512
WeII, I guess that's
the difference between us.

261
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,450
See, I'd never make a Iist.

262
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:06,404
I never know how Iong to wait in this
type of situation before you can taIk.

263
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,272
Maybe a IittIe Ionger.

264
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:18,185
In these recipes,
the quantities may seem unusuaI.

265
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,225
Like the coconut MockoIate
hoIiday nut bars?

266
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,318
I said four cups of coconut
and four of nuts...

267
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:27,490
...and onIy one tabIespoon
of MockoIate.

268
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,293
-Doesn't matter.
-What?

269
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:37,308
Our FDA approvaI didn't come through.
Something about Iaboratory rats.

270
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:43,247
-Gosh, I'm sorry.
-Yeah. Anyhow, here's your check.

271
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:47,218
Thank you for aII the troubIe
you went through.

272
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:51,312
You didn't eat a Iot of it
whiIe you were cooking, did you?

273
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,221
WeII, I ate some.

274
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:56,226
Oh, some is fine. Some is not a Iot.

275
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:01,322
So it doesn't burn
when you pee, does it?

276
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,376
Is that him again?

277
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:24,354
I'd come to the phone,
but my ankIes are weighing me down.

278
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,357
I don't think this is the best time.

279
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,362
Look, can you do something for me?

280
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,397
Sure. What?

281
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,463
AII right.

282
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,373
Music?

283
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,273
Sure.

284
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,375
<i>The next one's dedicated</i>
<i>to Rachel from Ross.</i>

285
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:58,422
<i>Rachel, he wants you to know</i>
<i>he's deeply sorry...</i>

286
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:02,221
<i>...and he hopes you can forgive him.</i>

287
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:37,351
<i>We've just gotten a call from Rachel</i>
<i>and she told us what Ross did.</i>

288
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:40,388
<i>It's appalling.</i>
<i>Ross, if you're listening...</i>

289
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,491
<i>...I don't wanna play</i>
<i>your song anymore.</i>

290
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:52,275
<i>Let's devote our time</i>
<i>to a couple that stands a chance.</i>

291
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:57,474
<i>Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you.</i>
<i>She hopes you two will work it out.</i>

292
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,374
Thanks for coming in again.

293
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,353
Not at aII. I have no moraIs.
I need cash.

294
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,456
Like I'm Iooking in a mirror.

295
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:46,492
Anyway, they're caIIed Fish-tachios.
They taste exactIy Iike pistachios.

296
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:50,564
But they're made primariIy
of reconstituted fish bits.

297
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,498
-Here, try one.
-AII right.

298
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:57,275
-You're not aIIergic to anything?
-Cat hair.

299
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,468
Oh, sorry.
