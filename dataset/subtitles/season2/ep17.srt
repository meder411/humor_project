1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-Hey, Dad. What are you doing here?
-I just stopped by your boyfriend's.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-And?
-I was gonna punch him in the nose.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But he had the game on,
so we started watching.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At haIftime,
I was gonna give him what for.

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-But he offered me a beer. Know what?
-What?

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's got it on tap!

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In his apartment. The thing is buiIt
into his bar. It's unbeIievabIe!

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad, did you taIk about me?

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, right. WeII, actuaIIy,
we never got to you.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look, you're a big girI. I just hope
you know what you're doing.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
-You're wearing the tie I got you!
-Yeah.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So where did you get the hat?

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know.

15
00:00:06,395 --> 00:00:10,422
So, what do you think?
<i>Casa de</i> Joey.

16
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,425
-I decorated it myseIf.
-Get out!

17
00:00:15,338 --> 00:00:17,397
Wow, Joey, this is....

18
00:00:18,207 --> 00:00:21,199
-Art.
-Art it is.

19
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,243
Check this out.
Is it a coffee tabIe?

20
00:00:24,347 --> 00:00:27,407
Is it a panther?
There's no need to decide.

21
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:31,409
Hey, nice piIIow.

22
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:35,418
So now teII me,
is this genuine Muppet skin?

23
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:39,224
Hey, exceIIent water tabIe thing.

24
00:00:39,328 --> 00:00:44,322
Thanks. I Iove this. But you
know what? It makes me want to pee.

25
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:47,368
Yeah, me too.
I think that's the chaIIenge.

26
00:00:49,338 --> 00:00:52,273
How come ChandIer didn't come?

27
00:00:54,276 --> 00:00:57,439
It's because he had
a thing with the thing.

28
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:01,374
Right. I got it.

29
00:01:03,285 --> 00:01:06,379
So why don't you show us
the rest of your <i>casa</i>?

30
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,188
The best part! Come on.

31
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,325
Nice toiIet.

32
00:01:20,403 --> 00:01:22,303
No. Behind it.

33
00:01:22,338 --> 00:01:26,331
-You have a phone in here?
-That's right. I have a phone...

34
00:01:26,442 --> 00:01:28,410
...in here.

35
00:01:29,412 --> 00:01:31,403
-Promise me something.
-Yeah?

36
00:01:31,447 --> 00:01:34,314
Never caII me from that phone.

37
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:37,242
The One Where Eddie Moves In

38
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:32,398
Okay, here we go.

39
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:38,212
Sorry, they were aII out of appIe pie.
Someone just got the Iast piece.

40
00:02:39,248 --> 00:02:41,443
Oh, my God!
You won't beIieve this!

41
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:44,445
I have just been discovered.

42
00:02:46,222 --> 00:02:51,216
Now wait a minute. I cIaimed you
in the name of France four years ago.

43
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:54,418
Anyway.

44
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,433
Don't freak out and say how
great this is untiI I'm done.

45
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:03,295
I met this producer
of this record company...

46
00:03:03,372 --> 00:03:06,307
...who said I have
a fresh, offbeat sound...

47
00:03:06,408 --> 00:03:10,174
...and she wants to do
a demo of ''SmeIIy Cat.''

48
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:14,206
I toId you not to do that yet.

49
00:03:16,185 --> 00:03:18,278
And she wants to do a video.

50
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:22,214
I'm not done yet, okay?

51
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:24,188
God!

52
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:29,186
If that goes weII, they may
even want to make an aIbum.

53
00:03:32,234 --> 00:03:34,202
I'm done now.

54
00:03:36,405 --> 00:03:40,307
If you care for me,
get the pie out of the man's hood.

55
00:03:40,342 --> 00:03:43,436
-Get the what?
-There's a pie in the hood. Go!

56
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:54,355
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry. My pie was in your hood.

57
00:03:57,326 --> 00:03:58,452
I have to get the coffee...

58
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:04,198
...out of that guy's pants and I'II
be back in the hospitaI by 7.

59
00:04:08,304 --> 00:04:12,263
Damn it, Ross!
Get your butt out of the bathroom!

60
00:04:12,374 --> 00:04:15,309
CaIm down. I'm bIow-drying.

61
00:04:15,411 --> 00:04:19,177
BIow-drying what?
You have no hair.

62
00:04:20,216 --> 00:04:23,413
-What's going on?
-He's been in there for an hour.

63
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,188
It's Iike I Iive with him again.

64
00:04:26,288 --> 00:04:30,224
He's here when I sIeep, wake up
and when I want to shower.

65
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:32,192
It's Iike I'm 1 6 again.

66
00:04:32,294 --> 00:04:35,229
WeII, you're not 1 6.
You're both aduIts now.

67
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:37,296
Get out, you doofus!

68
00:04:40,236 --> 00:04:43,228
Or, you know,
he's rubber and you're gIue.

69
00:04:46,342 --> 00:04:48,207
AII yours.

70
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:52,237
I hope you cIeaned your hair
out of the drain.

71
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,309
-Shut up!
-Shut up.

72
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,513
Cut it out!

73
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,354
I've never wanted you more.

74
00:05:38,394 --> 00:05:40,191
<i>Hello?</i>

75
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:44,426
-Louie? Where's Howard?
-<i>He went home.</i>

76
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:47,293
He said he might stop up.

77
00:05:47,336 --> 00:05:51,295
<i>He said to tell you</i>
<i>he wasn't feeling so good.</i>

78
00:05:51,407 --> 00:05:54,205
Hey, what time do you get off?

79
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,440
<i>I'm not feeling too good either.</i>

80
00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:07,446
So, what do you say, boys?
ShouId I caII him?

81
00:06:14,196 --> 00:06:18,292
You know what they say:
Ask your sIippers a question...

82
00:06:19,268 --> 00:06:21,395
...you're going crazy.

83
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:33,281
Freaking art!

84
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,384
-HeIIo.
-<i>Hey.</i>

85
00:06:37,186 --> 00:06:38,175
Hey!

86
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,381
Sorry I didn't make it over there.

87
00:06:40,422 --> 00:06:42,413
That's okay.

88
00:06:43,225 --> 00:06:45,216
You had a thing.

89
00:06:45,394 --> 00:06:51,390
-I hear the pIace Iooks great.
-Forget about it. I'm having a baII!

90
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:55,199
-How's the apartment doing?
-It's terrific.

91
00:06:55,237 --> 00:06:58,206
I mean, it's a reguIar space...

92
00:06:58,307 --> 00:06:59,501
...fest!

93
00:07:01,343 --> 00:07:03,174
WeII, great.

94
00:07:03,278 --> 00:07:07,237
Yeah, I just wanted
to caII and say hey.

95
00:07:09,151 --> 00:07:10,140
WeII, okay.

96
00:07:11,253 --> 00:07:14,381
-Was that the oven timer?
-That's right, my friend.

97
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,191
<i>-It's time for....</i>
<i>-Baywatch!</i>

98
00:07:22,264 --> 00:07:27,292
-You beIieve Stephanie has skin cancer?
-I can't beIieve she's Iieutenant!

99
00:07:29,204 --> 00:07:31,365
That's because you Iove
Yasmine BIeeth.

100
00:07:32,174 --> 00:07:35,166
How couId anyone not Iove
Yasmine BIeeth?

101
00:07:37,179 --> 00:07:38,271
They're running!

102
00:07:39,381 --> 00:07:42,373
See, this is the briIIiance
of the show.

103
00:07:43,185 --> 00:07:45,415
I say aIways keep them running.

104
00:07:46,321 --> 00:07:48,186
AII the time running!

105
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,221
Run!

106
00:07:51,193 --> 00:07:52,182
Run!

107
00:07:52,294 --> 00:07:55,229
Run, Yasmine! Run Iike the wind!

108
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,329
-But you wanted to Iive by yourseIf.
-I did. I thought it'd be great.

109
00:08:01,437 --> 00:08:05,168
I figured I'd have time aIone
with my thoughts.

110
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,142
It turns out I don't have
as many thoughts as you'd think.

111
00:08:10,245 --> 00:08:13,237
Why don't you taIk to ChandIer
and move back?

112
00:08:13,282 --> 00:08:17,343
You reaIIy think he'd take me?
We had a good taIk Iast night...

113
00:08:17,453 --> 00:08:22,390
-...but when I moved, I hurt him bad.
-He wouId definiteIy want you back.

114
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:26,150
I'm teIIing you,
no way he's moving back.

115
00:08:26,261 --> 00:08:30,254
But we had one of the greatest
taIks we ever had Iast night.

116
00:08:30,365 --> 00:08:32,162
I mean, it was--

117
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:35,170
It was Iike when we first
Iived together.

118
00:08:35,304 --> 00:08:38,273
I know you don't want
to hear this now...

119
00:08:38,307 --> 00:08:43,267
...but we've seen him
in his new pIace. And he's happy.

120
00:08:43,378 --> 00:08:45,403
He's decorated.

121
00:08:46,381 --> 00:08:50,374
ChandIer, he has moved on, okay?
You have to, too.

122
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:54,378
You have to accept the fact
that you're just friends now.

123
00:08:54,456 --> 00:08:56,390
You're not...

124
00:08:57,192 --> 00:08:59,285
...roommates anymore.

125
00:09:00,162 --> 00:09:02,153
Okay, you ready to try one?

126
00:09:02,331 --> 00:09:03,389
Okay.

127
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:09,135
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

128
00:09:09,238 --> 00:09:11,365
<i>What are they feeding you?</i>

129
00:09:12,274 --> 00:09:15,334
<i>Smelly, smelly</i>
<i>Really bad smelling smelly cat</i>

130
00:09:16,144 --> 00:09:18,169
Whoa! Oh, my God!

131
00:09:20,282 --> 00:09:23,251
I mean, Iike, who was that?

132
00:09:24,286 --> 00:09:28,279
They're your backup singers.
Behind you, hon.

133
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,260
I thought they were just watching me.

134
00:09:32,294 --> 00:09:35,195
Like at an aquarium, you know?

135
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:39,165
-They're so good. You're so good!
-AIrighty!

136
00:09:39,268 --> 00:09:44,171
Okay, now that everyone knows
everyone, Iet's try it again.

137
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:45,195
From the top.

138
00:09:45,274 --> 00:09:48,300

<i>Smelly, smelly, smelly, really bad</i>
<i>Smelling smelly cat. It's not your--</i>

142
00:10:00,188 --> 00:10:05,387
...that everyone gets how smeIIy
this cat actuaIIy is.

143
00:10:06,228 --> 00:10:11,393
If we couId taIk about this. I need
to feeI that you care about the cat.

144
00:10:14,236 --> 00:10:18,229
We can taIk, but this costs
$100 a minute to be in here.

145
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:22,403
Okay, so the cat stinks,
but you Iove it. Let's go.

146
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:26,408
No, there is no way
he was a veIociraptor.

147
00:10:26,515 --> 00:10:28,449
Look at the craniaI ridge.

148
00:10:29,217 --> 00:10:33,347
If Dino was a veIociraptor,
he wouId have eaten the FIintstones.

149
00:10:35,324 --> 00:10:38,350
-Were you taking a nap?
-I was.

150
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,361
Can you hoId on?
That's the other Iine.

151

00:10:43,231 --> 00:10:46,223
Yeah, she's here,
but can she caII you back?

00:10:46,335 --> 00:10:47,427
Okay, thanks.

-CaII Joanna.
-She Ieave a number?

155
00:10:50,372 --> 00:10:53,273
Did you see me write one down?

156
00:10:54,343 --> 00:10:57,335
I don't have her number, butt-munch.

157
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,282

-You're the baby.

-Off my back.
-Get out of my face.

159
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,379
Wait, hoId on, Tony. HoId on.

-Give me that.
-Okay.

00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:28,336
Sweetie, before I forget, did I
Ieave my diaphragm at your pIace?

166
00:11:30,245 --> 00:11:32,213
Hi, Mom.

167
00:11:53,368 --> 00:11:56,360
So how's the paIace?

168
00:11:56,438 --> 00:12:00,306
Funny you shouId mention that,
because I was thinking--

169
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:02,400
What's with the boxes?

170
00:12:04,312 --> 00:12:06,405
ActuaIIy, I have some news.

171
00:12:07,182 --> 00:12:10,413
Is Joey gonna pick up
his moose hat or shouId I toss it?

172
00:12:11,386 --> 00:12:15,413
Why don't you ask him yourseIf?
This is my roommate, Eddie.

173
00:12:16,191 --> 00:12:19,217
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

174
00:12:19,394 --> 00:12:24,331
I'II take that.
It's what I came for.

175
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,425
So this is new.
Where did you two meet?

176
00:12:28,203 --> 00:12:31,400
At the supermarket
in the ethnic food section.

177
00:12:32,207 --> 00:12:34,505
I heIped him pick a chorizo.

178
00:12:36,344 --> 00:12:40,405
We got to taIking. He needed
a pIace and I had a spare room.

179
00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:43,316
Oh, now it's a spare room?

180
00:12:43,418 --> 00:12:46,319
WeII, yeah.
In that it's not being used...

181
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:48,446
...and I have it to spare.

182
00:12:50,425 --> 00:12:53,417
WeII, I got what I came for.

183
00:12:56,264 --> 00:12:58,255
I'II see you guys.

184
00:13:00,202 --> 00:13:01,362
Hey, Joe.

185
00:13:01,403 --> 00:13:04,270
When'd you start using
moose in your hair?

186
00:13:06,374 --> 00:13:09,207
Is this guy great or what?

187
00:13:09,277 --> 00:13:12,178
Yeah, yeah, he is.

188
00:13:18,286 --> 00:13:22,382
-He has a new roommate? Who is he?
-Eddie. He just met him.

189
00:13:22,491 --> 00:13:27,190
It'II never Iast.
He's just a rebound roommate.

190
00:13:30,298 --> 00:13:32,289
Check it out! Check it out!

191
00:13:32,334 --> 00:13:35,326
It's ''SmeIIy Cat,'' the video!

192
00:13:36,404 --> 00:13:41,307
Now, I haven't seen it yet,
so if you don't Iike it...

193
00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:45,243
...so what?
None of you ever made a video.

194
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,313
<i>Get out of here, cat! You stink!</i>

195
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:06,258
-Smoking!
-Look at me!

196
00:14:06,368 --> 00:14:09,269
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

197
00:14:10,205 --> 00:14:13,174

<i>It's not your fault</i>

200
00:14:24,186 --> 00:14:28,384
<i>Smelly, smelly, really bad smelling</i>
<i>Smelly cat, it's not your fault</i>

201
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:31,284
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

202
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:33,385
-Oh, my God!
-I know.

203
00:14:33,428 --> 00:14:35,419
I sound amazing!

204
00:14:39,301 --> 00:14:44,238
<i>They won't take you to the vet</i>
<i>You're obviously not their favorite pet</i>

205

00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:50,201

207
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:52,202
<i>Oh, no</i>

208
00:14:52,314 --> 00:14:57,411
I've never heard myseIf sing before.
I mean, except in my own head.

209
00:14:57,452 --> 00:15:01,354
This is so cooI!
Now I can hear what you hear!

210
00:15:02,257 --> 00:15:04,248
Pretty different, huh?

211
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,296
I am sorry,
but I'm incredibIy taIented!

212
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:12,393

214
00:15:26,281 --> 00:15:29,182
-Joey, what's going on, man?
-Eddie.

215
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:32,181
-Morning.
-Morning.

216
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,383
I just came by to pick up my maiI.

217
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:38,486
-Where's the maiI?
-Over on the tabIe.

218
00:15:39,394 --> 00:15:41,385
It's not on this tabIe anymore?

219
00:15:41,496 --> 00:15:44,397
No. Eddie Iikes to keep it over there.

220
00:15:47,402 --> 00:15:51,304
AII right, here you go, my friend.
Eggs à Ia Eddie.

221
00:15:56,344 --> 00:15:58,403
That's great.

222
00:16:00,348 --> 00:16:01,337
What?

223
00:16:01,383 --> 00:16:07,253
I thought you Iiked eggs with bread
with the hoIe in the middIe à Ia me!

224
00:16:07,355 --> 00:16:11,257
I do, but Eddie makes them this way.
They're darn good.

225
00:16:11,393 --> 00:16:13,384
-Wanna try some?
-No, thanks.

226
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:18,394
AII right. WeII, you guys,
I'm out of here.

227
00:16:19,301 --> 00:16:21,394
-See you, paIs.
-See you.

228
00:16:24,372 --> 00:16:28,308
-How are you two getting aIong?
-I couIdn't be happier.

229
00:16:28,376 --> 00:16:32,278
Great. I'm happy for you.

230
00:16:35,216 --> 00:16:37,275
AII right, that's it!

231
00:16:37,385 --> 00:16:42,288
He just comes in here,
Mr. Johnny New Eggs, with his--

232
00:16:43,325 --> 00:16:48,194
His moving the maiI
and his, ''See you, paIs.''

233
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:51,322
There's no juice!

234
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:57,201
There's no juice for the peopIe
who need the juice. I need the juice!

235
00:16:57,238 --> 00:17:00,173
There's another carton
right over there.

236
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,344
This isn't about juice anymore,
aII right?

237
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:07,239
-AII right. What's it about?
-Eggs!

238
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,285
Whose eggs do you Iike better,
his or mine?

239
00:17:11,353 --> 00:17:14,220
-I Iike both eggs equaIIy!
-Come on!

240
00:17:14,389 --> 00:17:19,156
Nobody Iikes two eggs equaIIy!
Which one do you Iike better?

241
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,287
What's the difference?
Your eggs aren't here anymore!

242
00:17:23,365 --> 00:17:26,232
You took your eggs and you Ieft!

243
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:30,203
Did you expect me
to never find new eggs?

244
00:17:30,305 --> 00:17:32,466
Maybe this isn't about the eggs.

245
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:37,167
Maybe this is about
the chicken that Iaid them.

246
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:42,248
What chicken?
There's no chicken.

247
00:17:42,317 --> 00:17:44,376
I can't taIk to you!

248
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,325
-I want <i>Entertainment Tonight.</i>
-We're watching...

249
00:17:51,426 --> 00:17:54,259
...<i>Predators of the Serengeti.</i>

250
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:57,423
-WouId you guys stop?!
-It's my TV!

251
00:17:58,233 --> 00:17:59,222
-Quit it!
-Bite me!

252
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:00,232
Oh, my God!

253
00:18:00,335 --> 00:18:03,236
Monica keeps changing the channeI.

254
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:06,206
Great. Why don't you teII Mommy on me?

255
00:18:06,341 --> 00:18:09,333
Now I'm Mommy in this IittIe pIay?

256
00:18:09,377 --> 00:18:15,247
Look, I refuse to get sucked into this
weird IittIe GeIIer dimension thing!

257
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,285
I'm gonna take a nice Iong,
hot bubbIe bath...

258
00:18:18,386 --> 00:18:21,355

are driving me crazy!

259
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:28,194
-What do we do about this?
-Tape <i>Entertainment Tonight.</i>

260
00:18:28,296 --> 00:18:31,265
Not that! This! Us!

261
00:18:31,366 --> 00:18:34,199
Oh, my God, Ross....
You're just....

262
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:37,170
Since you've been here,
you drive....

263
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:40,265
Mon, you've gone uItrasonic
again, aII right?

264
00:18:40,475 --> 00:18:43,410
I just can't stand you being here...

265
00:18:44,212 --> 00:18:45,201
...aII the time!

266
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,183
Why? Why can't you stand me
being here? We're just having fun.

267
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:52,412
Fun? You think this is fun?

268
00:18:54,222 --> 00:18:57,385
We were fooIing around,
Iike when we were kids.

269
00:18:58,193 --> 00:19:01,162
I hated you when we were kids!

270
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:06,157
-You hated me when we were kids?
-I hated you. I Ioved you...

271
00:19:06,234 --> 00:19:11,228
...in a you're-my-brother-so-I-have-to
way, but basicaIIy I hated your guts.

272
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:16,140
-Why did you hate me?
-Because you were mean to me...

273
00:19:16,244 --> 00:19:20,374
...and you teased me
and you aIways got your way.

274
00:19:21,249 --> 00:19:24,150
And that wasn't fun for you?

275
00:19:27,188 --> 00:19:29,179
I can't beIieve you hated me.

276
00:19:30,358 --> 00:19:33,293
But now I Iove you.

277
00:19:35,163 --> 00:19:38,257
-And not just because I have to.
-ReaIIy?

278
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:40,163
Yeah.

279
00:19:41,202 --> 00:19:44,365
You're just gonna have to stop
pissing me off.

280
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:50,309
I can do that.

281
00:19:50,378 --> 00:19:53,211
Then I won't have to kiII you.

282
00:19:56,184 --> 00:19:59,312
So you wanna watch
<i>Entertainment Tonight</i>?

283
00:19:59,387 --> 00:20:01,184
Thanks.

284
00:20:01,222 --> 00:20:04,214
<i>Tonight, America's sport's</i>
<i>magazine moves to--</i>

285
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:06,419
-You know what?
-What?

286
00:20:07,195 --> 00:20:11,188
If you reaIIy wanna watch
that Serengeti thing, we can.

287
00:20:11,232 --> 00:20:12,324
Okay.

288
00:20:20,408 --> 00:20:23,400
Listen, you are not going
to beIieve this...

289
00:20:23,511 --> 00:20:26,344
...but that is not me
singing on the video.

290
00:20:31,219 --> 00:20:32,345
How did you find out?

291
00:20:32,453 --> 00:20:37,254
The record company sent a paper
for me to sign saying it's okay...

292
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:41,227
...for someone eIse to sing for me.
That was a cIue.

293
00:20:41,462 --> 00:20:43,225
What wiII you do?

294
00:20:43,331 --> 00:20:47,267
-I can't work with peopIe who do this.
-Sure.

295
00:20:47,335 --> 00:20:51,237
-I mean, this poor woman.
-What woman?

296
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:52,328
The voice woman.

297
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,274
She has a great voice,
but she doesn't have a video.

298
00:20:56,344 --> 00:21:00,371
-Okay, Pheebs, what about you?
-I have a video. Pay attention.

299
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:07,211
This voice woman, she's so taIented.

300
00:21:07,322 --> 00:21:12,282
But according to the producer peopIe,
she doesn't have the right Iook.

301
00:21:12,393 --> 00:21:15,419
She's Iike one of those
animaIs at the pound...

302
00:21:16,197 --> 00:21:19,496
...who nobody wants
because they're not pretty enough.

303
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:22,430
Or some oId dog
who's kind of stinky and--

304
00:21:23,204 --> 00:21:25,399
Oh, my God! She's ''SmeIIy Cat''!

305
00:21:28,343 --> 00:21:31,403
That song has so many IeveIs.

306
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:34,237
Hey, Eddie.

307
00:21:34,349 --> 00:21:36,340
You wanna pIay some foosbaII?

308
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:40,251
No, thanks, man.
I'm not reaIIy into sports.

309
00:21:45,226 --> 00:21:47,353
Yeah, okay. AII right.

310
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:51,455
Doesn't matter.
Time for <i>Baywatch</i>!

311
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:55,427

312
00:21:57,272 --> 00:21:59,365
You don't Iike that show?

313
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:04,177
It's just pretty peopIe
running around on the beach.

314
00:22:04,212 --> 00:22:06,373
That's the briIIiance of it.

315
00:22:08,383 --> 00:22:10,408
The pretty peopIe.

316
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:13,387
And the running.

317
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:18,316
I'm gonna go read in my room
for a IittIe whiIe.

318
00:22:19,327 --> 00:22:21,295
Okay, man.

319
00:23:18,386 --> 00:23:23,221
I'm gonna start off with a IittIe
