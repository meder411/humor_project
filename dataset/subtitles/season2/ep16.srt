1
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,356
This is weird. Ever notice Cap'n
Crunch's eyebrows are on his hat?

2
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:14,392
That's weird? The man's been captain
of a cereaI for the Iast 40 years.

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,329
What?

4
00:00:18,407 --> 00:00:21,308
The spoon!
You Iicked and you put.

5
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:26,244
You Iicked and you put.

6
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:27,407
Yeah, so?

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,410
Don't you see how gross that is?
It's Iike you using my toothbrush.

8
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:35,322
You used my toothbrush!

9
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:40,218
OnIy because I used the red one
to uncIog the drain.

10
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:43,262
Mine is the red one!

11
00:00:43,332 --> 00:00:48,360
Oh, God!
Can open. Worms everywhere!

12
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:53,368
Why can't we use the same toothbrush,
but we can use the same soap?

13
00:00:53,476 --> 00:00:57,378
Because soap is soap.
It's seIf-cIeaning.

14
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:00,212
Next time you shower...

15
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:05,219
...think about the Iast thing I wash
and the first thing you wash.

16
00:01:06,288 --> 00:01:08,313
The One Where Joey Moves Out

17
00:01:55,371 --> 00:01:59,432
Look at you fancy Iads!
What's the occasion?

18
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:03,172
You know that guy on my show
that's in a coma?

19
00:02:03,312 --> 00:02:05,371
He's having a brunch.

20
00:02:06,315 --> 00:02:09,182
-Ready when you are.
-Okey-doke.

21
00:02:09,285 --> 00:02:12,186
I can't beIieve
you're getting tattoos.

22
00:02:12,221 --> 00:02:14,189
You guys are getting tattoos?

23
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,384
Yes, but you cannot teII Ross.
I wanna surprise him.

24
00:02:18,194 --> 00:02:20,389
Wow, this is wiId!
What are you gonna get?

25
00:02:21,297 --> 00:02:23,390
I'm getting a IiIy.

26
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:27,225
For my mom, because her name's LiIy.

27
00:02:27,436 --> 00:02:32,203
That's Iucky. What if her name
was Big UgIy SpIotch?

28
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:35,336
-Where you getting it?
-My shouIder.

29
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:38,403
What?
What's on your shouIder?

30
00:02:39,215 --> 00:02:41,206
A chip.

31
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:45,420
I've got a big attitude probIem.

32
00:02:46,322 --> 00:02:49,314
-A tattoo. I'm getting a tattoo.
-A tattoo?

33
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:52,417
Why? Why wouId you wanna do that?

34
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:57,456
-You don't think they're kind of cooI?
-No. Sorry, I don't.

35
00:02:58,234 --> 00:03:01,203
Why wouId anyone pay
to scar their body for Iife?

36
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,363
What if it doesn't come out right?

37
00:03:03,405 --> 00:03:07,273
It's Iike having a bad haircut
aII the time.

38
00:03:08,377 --> 00:03:11,210
Why is everyone staring at me?

39
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,306
Sign this card for Dad.
Richard wiII be here soon.

40
00:03:14,383 --> 00:03:18,285
-He's going to the party?
-He's my parents' best friend.

41
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:21,481
So is today the day
you teII them about you two?

42
00:03:22,224 --> 00:03:26,388
Yeah, for my dad's birthday,
I decided to give him a stroke.

43
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:29,322
No, I think you shouId teII them.

44
00:03:29,398 --> 00:03:33,198
I don't know how serious he is.
UntiI I do, I say nothing.

45
00:03:33,302 --> 00:03:35,395
I don't think
Mom and Dad wouId mind.

46
00:03:35,437 --> 00:03:39,305
Remember when you were 9
and Richard was 30, Dad said:

47
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:41,502
''God, I hope they get together.''

48
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:48,339
-HeIIo?
<i>-I'm double-parked.</i>

49
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:50,248
Okay. Come on, Ross.

50
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:56,322
-Bye, you.
-Bye.

51
00:04:01,363 --> 00:04:03,354
Bye, you.

52
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:18,378
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
Okay, wait, wait.

53
00:04:19,381 --> 00:04:23,181
-It's gonna be fine.
-Are you not nervous?

54
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:26,416
I'm terrified.
This is just a very absorbent suit.

55
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:29,180
-ShaII we?
-Yes.

56
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:30,419
No. You know what?

57
00:04:31,193 --> 00:04:34,287
Ross, Iet's switch pIaces.
Get in the middIe.

58
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,424
This Iooks Iike we're trying
to cover something up.

59
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,296
You couId come in straddIing him,
they stiII wouIdn't beIieve it.

60
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,298
We're here!

61
00:04:45,407 --> 00:04:48,399
Hi, kids! Hi, darIing!

62
00:04:48,444 --> 00:04:51,413
-Happy birthday, Dad.
-Thank you.

63
00:04:51,447 --> 00:04:52,436
Happy birthday!

64
00:04:53,215 --> 00:04:55,410
You kids thanked
Dr. Burke for the ride?

65
00:04:55,451 --> 00:05:00,252
ActuaIIy, Mom, I think Monica
thanked him for the both of us.

66
00:05:01,257 --> 00:05:03,248
So you kids take the train in?

67
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,192
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.

68
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:12,258
Speaking of whom, I hear he's got
some 20-year-oId twinkie in the city.

69
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:20,308
Finger cramp! Oh, God!
Sorry. Here, Iet me get that, Mom.

70
00:05:20,376 --> 00:05:25,404
So Richard's shopping
in the junior section?

71
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:27,375
Are we stiII on that?

72
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:31,409
You just know she's got
the IQ of a napkin.

73
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:34,178
She's probabIy not even pretty.

74
00:05:34,223 --> 00:05:38,182
Just young enough so that
everything is stiII pointing up.

75
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:49,201
-Can you beIieve this?
-It's a great apartment.

76
00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:52,297
In the bathroom,
there's mirrors on both sides.

77
00:05:52,408 --> 00:05:55,400
It's Iike peeing with the Rockettes.

78
00:05:56,245 --> 00:05:59,214
WeII, there's my fantasy come true.

79
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:01,249
No, seriousIy.

80
00:06:02,284 --> 00:06:06,345
-We were just saying, great apartment!
-Thanks. You want it?

81
00:06:06,388 --> 00:06:10,256
I'm moving to a bigger pIace.
You shouId take this one.

82
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,186
-Can you see me in a pIace Iike this?
-Why not?

83
00:06:14,263 --> 00:06:19,257
You hate park views and high ceiIings?
Come on, I'II show you the kitchen.

84
00:06:20,302 --> 00:06:23,203
That's okay,
I saw a kitchen this morning.

85
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:26,400
On TV.
Stop taIking. Okay!

86
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,303
-Come on, teII us!
-Is she reaIIy 20?

87
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:32,370
I am not teIIing you anything.

88
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:36,281
Come on, it's my birthday.
Let me Iive vicariousIy!

89
00:06:36,318 --> 00:06:38,309
You don't want to do that.

90
00:06:38,387 --> 00:06:41,379
What's a IittIe midIife crisis
between friends?

91
00:06:41,423 --> 00:06:44,221
-Let it go.
-I know what it's Iike.

92
00:06:44,293 --> 00:06:49,424
When I turned 50, I got the Porsche.
You got your own IittIe speedster.

93
00:06:50,232 --> 00:06:53,326
-SeriousIy, it's not Iike that.
-TeII you what.

94
00:06:53,402 --> 00:06:57,236
Maybe one weekend
you can borrow the car and I couId--

95
00:06:57,306 --> 00:06:59,501
I beg you not
to finish that sentence!

96
00:07:00,175 --> 00:07:02,143
What? I'm kidding!

97
00:07:02,244 --> 00:07:05,338
You know I'd never Iet him
touch the Porsche.

98
00:07:12,354 --> 00:07:17,257
Okay, Rach. Which IiIy?
This IiIy or that IiIy?

99
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,253
-WeII, I--
-I Iike this IiIy.

100
00:07:20,295 --> 00:07:25,460
It's more open. That's Iike my mom.
She had a more open, giving spirit.

101
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:28,293
Foghorn Leghorn!

102
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:35,275
BIond girI? You're in room two.
Not-so-bIond girI, you're with me.

103
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,278
Here we go!

104
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:40,181
You're not going.

105
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:45,279
-Is this because of what Ross said?
-No.

106
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:48,322
-WeII, yeah, maybe.
-I don't beIieve this.

107
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:53,327
Is this how this reIationship is
gonna work? Ross equaIs boss?

108
00:07:53,395 --> 00:07:56,193
Come on, what is this, 1 922?

109
00:07:56,331 --> 00:07:58,196
What's 1 922?

110
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,131
Just, you know, a Iong time ago.

111
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:05,331
When men used to teII women
what to do a Iot.

112
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:10,134
Then there was suffrage, which
was good. But it sounds horribIe.

113
00:08:13,148 --> 00:08:16,345
-Do you want this tattoo?
-I do. It's just that Ross--

114
00:08:16,385 --> 00:08:21,152
Okay, hey!
Is your boyfriend the boss of you?

115
00:08:21,356 --> 00:08:24,291
-No.
-Okay, who is the boss of you?

116
00:08:26,161 --> 00:08:27,253
You?

117
00:08:28,163 --> 00:08:30,393
No! You are the boss of you!

118
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:36,263
You march in there and get
that heart tattooed on your hip! Go!

119
00:08:39,274 --> 00:08:43,210
I haven't even gotten my tattoo
and I'm aIready tougher.

120
00:08:48,183 --> 00:08:49,207
How you doing?

121
00:08:49,284 --> 00:08:51,377
I'm a twinkie!

122
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:54,417
ReaIIy? I'm a hero.

123
00:08:57,192 --> 00:08:58,420
This is so hard.

124
00:08:59,194 --> 00:09:02,163
Yeah, I know. I hate it too.

125
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:05,132
Look, maybe we shouId just teII them.

126
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:08,226
Maybe we shouId just teII
your parents first.

127
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,170
My parents are dead.

128
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,175
God, you are so Iucky!

129
00:09:15,244 --> 00:09:18,145
-I mean-- You know what I mean.
-I know.

130
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:20,340
Just hang in there, okay?

131
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:25,149
-Okay, I'II go out first, aII right?
-AII right.

132
00:09:29,157 --> 00:09:32,251
Judy! Going to the bathroom.
Good for you!

133
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:39,461
Thank you, Richard.
I appreciate the support.

134
00:09:43,272 --> 00:09:48,266
Honey. Seen my Harmon KiIIebrew bat?
Bob won't beIieve I have one.

135
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,175
I have no idea.

136
00:09:50,312 --> 00:09:54,180
Did you know Richard
has a twinkie in the city?

137
00:09:54,283 --> 00:09:58,379
I know. He's Iike a new man.
It's Iike a scene from <i>Cocoon.</i>

138
00:09:59,187 --> 00:10:02,281
I never wouId have pictured
Richard with a bimbo.

139
00:10:02,324 --> 00:10:06,226
He toId Johnny Shapiro
that she's quite a girI.

140
00:10:06,295 --> 00:10:09,196
He said he's faIIing in Iove with her.

141
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:12,199
-ReaIIy?
-I've never seen him this happy.

142
00:10:12,234 --> 00:10:16,398
So, Jack. Ever think about trading
me in for a younger modeI?

143
00:10:16,505 --> 00:10:19,201
Of course not.

144
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:23,301
With you, it's Iike
I've got two 25-year-oIds.

145
00:10:26,315 --> 00:10:28,215
Oh, Jack, stop!

146
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,218
Come on!

147
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:33,445
It's my birthday!

148
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:41,420
Can we drop this? I am not
interested in the guy's apartment.

149
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:46,433
PIease. I saw the way you were
checking out his moIdings. You want it.

150
00:10:46,535 --> 00:10:51,370
Why wouId I want another apartment?
I've aIready got one I Iove.

151
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,240
It wouIdn't kiII you
to say it once in a whiIe.

152
00:10:57,446 --> 00:11:02,315
AII right. You want the truth?
I'm thinking about it.

153
00:11:02,384 --> 00:11:04,284
-What?
-I'm sorry.

154
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:08,380
I'm 28. I've never Iived aIone
and I'm finaIIy at a pIace...

155
00:11:08,423 --> 00:11:13,326
...where I got enough money
that I don't need a roommate anymore.

156
00:11:13,395 --> 00:11:18,332
I don't need a roommate either.
I can afford to Iive here by myseIf.

157
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,201
I may have to bring in somebody
every week to Iick the siIverware.

158
00:11:23,305 --> 00:11:28,299
Why are you so bent out of shape? We
didn't agree to Iive together forever.

159
00:11:28,343 --> 00:11:30,436
We're not Bert and Ernie.

160
00:11:32,314 --> 00:11:36,410
I'm aware that we're not
gay puppets, aII right?

161
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:38,343
You know what?

162
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:43,323
If this is the way you feeI,
then maybe you shouId take it.

163
00:11:43,358 --> 00:11:45,417
-That's how I feeI.
-Then take it!

164
00:11:46,228 --> 00:11:47,320
-Maybe I wiII!
-Fine!

165
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:53,425
Great! You can spend more time
with your reaI friends, the spoons!

166
00:11:54,336 --> 00:11:57,237
Whose drink can I freshen?

167
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,367
AImost time for cake!

168
00:12:10,385 --> 00:12:12,285
Mon, are you okay?

169
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,381
You remember that video
I found of Mom and Dad?

170
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:19,422
WeII, I just caught the Iive show.

171
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,225
-Hey, there.
-What?

172
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:31,395
Nothing. I just heard
something nice about you.

173
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:34,204
ReaIIy?

174
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:35,333
Richard?

175
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:40,347
-Your son isn't seeing anyone, is he?
-Not that I know of.

176
00:12:40,415 --> 00:12:45,409
I was thinking, why doesn't
he give Monica a caII?

177
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:49,424
That's an idea.

178
00:12:49,524 --> 00:12:53,221
WeII, actuaIIy,
I'm aIready seeing someone.

179
00:12:53,328 --> 00:12:54,317
Oh?

180
00:12:58,366 --> 00:13:03,167
She never teIIs us anything. Ross, did
you know she's seeing someone?

181
00:13:03,205 --> 00:13:06,470
Mom, there are
so many peopIe in my Iife.

182
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:12,203
Some of them are seeing peopIe
and some aren't. Is that crystaI?

183
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:16,284
So who's the mystery man?

184
00:13:17,185 --> 00:13:19,278
WeII, he's a doctor.

185
00:13:19,387 --> 00:13:21,184
A reaI doctor?

186
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:23,382
No, a doctor of meat.

187
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:28,194
Of course he's a reaI doctor.
And he's handsome.

188
00:13:29,197 --> 00:13:31,392
And he's sweet,
and I know you'd Iike him.

189
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,497
WeII, that's wonderfuI.

190
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,199
Mom, it's okay.

191
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,505
-It is, Judy.
-Jack!

192
00:13:46,448 --> 00:13:51,215
CouId you come in here for a moment?
Now!

193
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,320
-Found it!
-I'II take that, Dad.

194
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,356
It seems your daughter and Richard
are something of an item.

195
00:14:03,265 --> 00:14:07,167
That's impossibIe.
He's got a twinkie in the city.

196
00:14:07,402 --> 00:14:09,199
I'm the twinkie.

197
00:14:09,404 --> 00:14:11,463
-You are?
-She's not a twinkie!

198
00:14:12,307 --> 00:14:15,367
Look, this is the best reIationship
I've been in--

199
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,174
Oh, pIease! A reIationship?

200
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,216
Yes, a reIationship!
I am crazy about this man.

201
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:25,309
-ReaIIy?
-Yes.

202
00:14:25,387 --> 00:14:29,414
Am I supposed to stand here
and Iisten to this on my birthday?

203
00:14:30,192 --> 00:14:34,288
This is a good thing. You said
you've never seen Richard happier.

204
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:35,318
When?

205
00:14:35,397 --> 00:14:39,493
Upstairs in the bathroom,
right before you feIt up Mom!

206
00:14:57,319 --> 00:15:00,345
It Iooks so good!
Oh, I Iove it.

207
00:15:00,388 --> 00:15:04,154
I know, so do I.
I'm so gIad you made me do this.

208
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:06,352
Okay, Iet me see yours.

209
00:15:09,264 --> 00:15:11,289
Let's see yours again.

210
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:16,294
-We just saw mine. Let me see yours.
-Oh, okay.

211
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:19,269
Oh, no!

212
00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:25,405
It's gone! That's so weird.
I don't know where it went.

213
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:30,310
-You didn't get it?
-No.

214
00:15:30,485 --> 00:15:33,318
-Why not?
-I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

215
00:15:33,388 --> 00:15:36,289
How couId you do this?
This was your idea!

216
00:15:36,324 --> 00:15:40,317
I know! I was gonna get it,
but he came in with this needIe.

217
00:15:40,395 --> 00:15:44,195
Did you know
they do this with needIes?

218
00:15:44,232 --> 00:15:46,200
ReaIIy? You don't say?

219
00:15:46,234 --> 00:15:49,397
Because mine was Iicked on by kittens!

220
00:15:50,305 --> 00:15:53,399
I'm sorry.
SeriousIy, does it hurt a Iot?

221
00:15:53,441 --> 00:15:57,241
No, it's just a pinch. Like that--

222
00:15:57,312 --> 00:15:59,212
Oh, my God!

223
00:16:00,181 --> 00:16:03,344
That reaIIy hurt me!
Oh, that's gonna Ieave a mark.

224
00:16:08,356 --> 00:16:10,187
I'm sorry about what--

225
00:16:10,258 --> 00:16:13,193
-Yeah, me too.
-I know.

226
00:16:15,397 --> 00:16:18,264
So do we need to hug here?

227
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,393
No, we're aII right.

228
00:16:22,203 --> 00:16:24,171
So I got you something.

229
00:16:25,173 --> 00:16:26,265
PIastic spoons!

230
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:32,176
-Great!
-Lick away, my man.

231
00:16:32,314 --> 00:16:36,410
These wiII go great in my new pIace,
tiII I get reaI ones.

232
00:16:37,185 --> 00:16:38,277
What?

233
00:16:38,386 --> 00:16:42,379
I can't use these forever.
They're no friend of the environment.

234
00:16:43,224 --> 00:16:46,216
No, I mean what's this
about your new pIace?

235
00:16:46,428 --> 00:16:51,331
-I'm moving out, Iike we taIked about.
-I didn't think that was serious.

236
00:16:52,434 --> 00:16:55,335
I thought that was just a fight.

237
00:16:55,403 --> 00:16:59,430
WeII, it was a fight.
Based on serious stuff, remember?

238
00:17:00,175 --> 00:17:02,166
About how I never Iived aIone?

239
00:17:02,243 --> 00:17:05,371
I think it wouId be good for me.
HeIp me to grow...

240
00:17:06,147 --> 00:17:07,375
...or whatever.

241
00:17:11,186 --> 00:17:13,279
WeII, there you go.

242
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:18,383
Are you cooI with this?
I don't wanna Ieave you high and dry.

243
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,152
I've never been Iower or wetter.

244
00:17:23,298 --> 00:17:27,257
I'II be fine. I'II just turn
your bedroom into a game room.

245
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:30,202
Put the foosbaII tabIe in there.

246
00:17:31,373 --> 00:17:34,240
Why do you get to keep the tabIe?

247
00:17:36,311 --> 00:17:38,472
I did pay for haIf of it.

248
00:17:41,383 --> 00:17:46,411
-And I paid for the other haIf.
-AII right, I'II pIay you for it.

249
00:17:47,188 --> 00:17:48,280
AII right, you're on.

250
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:52,292
I can take two minutes
out of my day to kick your ass.

251
00:17:52,494 --> 00:17:56,430
Your men wiII get scored on
more times than your sister.

252
00:18:03,438 --> 00:18:05,235
Which sister?

253
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:11,209
So are you sorry that I toId them?

254
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,375
No. It's been a Iong time
since your dad and I went running.

255
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:21,378
-Did you get it?
-Is Ross here?

256
00:18:22,157 --> 00:18:25,183
-He went out for pizza.
-Okay, reaIIy quick.

257
00:18:26,294 --> 00:18:29,161
-That's great!
-Very tastefuI.

258
00:18:30,165 --> 00:18:32,156
-Wanna see mine?
-Yes.

259
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,168
What? You didn't get one.

260
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:37,261
Okay. WeII then, what is this?

261
00:18:39,174 --> 00:18:41,199
What are we Iooking at?

262
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:43,402
That bIue freckIe?

263
00:18:44,412 --> 00:18:46,209
That's my tattoo.

264
00:18:46,281 --> 00:18:49,182
That is not a tattoo.
That is a nothing.

265
00:18:49,317 --> 00:18:52,309
I got her in the chair,
he bareIy touched her...

266
00:18:52,387 --> 00:18:55,185
...she screamed and that was it.

267
00:18:55,223 --> 00:18:57,191
Okay, hi!

268
00:18:58,426 --> 00:19:03,159
For your information,
this is exactIy what I wanted.

269
00:19:03,231 --> 00:19:08,328
This is a tattoo of the Earth as seen
from a great, great distance.

270
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:12,333
It's the way my mother
sees me from heaven.

271
00:19:12,373 --> 00:19:15,274
Oh, what a Ioad of crap!

272
00:19:17,145 --> 00:19:18,271
That is a dot!

273
00:19:18,346 --> 00:19:23,283
Your mother's in heaven going,
''Where the heII's my IiIy, you wuss?!''

274
00:19:24,352 --> 00:19:30,188
Okay? That is not a tattoo!
This is a tattoo!

275
00:19:33,161 --> 00:19:34,355
You got a tattoo?

276
00:19:36,164 --> 00:19:37,256
Maybe.

277
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:41,359
But just a IittIe one.
Phoebe got the whoIe worId!

278
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:45,296
WeII, Iet me see.

279
00:19:48,276 --> 00:19:49,402
WeII?

280
00:19:50,178 --> 00:19:51,304
WeII, it's reaIIy...

281
00:19:53,214 --> 00:19:54,374
...sexy.

282
00:19:54,415 --> 00:19:58,181
I wouIdn't have thought
it wouId be, but...

283
00:19:58,219 --> 00:19:59,379
...wow!

284
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:05,316
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah. So...

285
00:20:05,393 --> 00:20:08,385
...is it sore?
Or can you do stuff?

286
00:20:11,332 --> 00:20:13,232
I guess.

287
00:20:13,301 --> 00:20:15,428
Save us some pizza.

288
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:23,504
Get it out of the corner!

289
00:20:24,412 --> 00:20:25,401
Pass it! Pass it!

290
00:20:26,314 --> 00:20:28,305
Stop taIking to your men!

291
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:33,352
And the tabIe is mine.

292
00:20:36,424 --> 00:20:39,222
CongratuIations.

293
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:53,332
You guys wiII stiII visit, right?

294
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:58,276
Oh, yeah. You got the big TV.
We'II be over there aII the time.

295
00:20:58,379 --> 00:21:00,370
Except when we are here.

296
00:21:05,286 --> 00:21:09,188
I know you're just moving uptown,
but I'II miss you.

297
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,383
How can you not be across the haII?

298
00:21:12,193 --> 00:21:16,186
Who's gonna eat aII our food
and tie up our phone Iines--?

299
00:21:16,297 --> 00:21:18,390
Is that my bra?

300
00:21:20,301 --> 00:21:24,237
-What are you doing with my bra?
-It's not what you think.

301
00:21:24,305 --> 00:21:28,332
We used it to fIing
water baIIoons off the roof.

302
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:33,210
Remember? Those kids couIdn't
even get theirs across the street.

303
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:35,239
Yeah, I remember.

304
00:21:37,218 --> 00:21:40,415
Let's bring the rest of these
down to the truck.

305
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,267
You want me to...

306
00:21:54,335 --> 00:21:57,270
...give you a hand
with the foosbaII tabIe?

307
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:01,172
You keep it.
You need the practice.

308
00:22:03,311 --> 00:22:05,279
Thanks.

309
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,372
So I guess this is it.

310
00:22:09,284 --> 00:22:12,412
Yeah, right. Yeah. I guess so.

311
00:22:14,422 --> 00:22:18,381
Listen, I don't know when
I'm gonna see you again.

312
00:22:18,426 --> 00:22:21,190
Tonight, at the coffeehouse.

313
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:24,231
Right. Yeah. Okay.

314
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:27,232
-Take care.
-Yeah.
