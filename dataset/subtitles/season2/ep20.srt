1
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:07,431
Hey.

2
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:12,377
-What you guys doing?
-Monica's making us watch <i>Old Yeller.</i>

3
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:17,476
Why are you guys upset?
It's <i>Old Yeller.</i> It's a happy movie.

4
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:24,247
-What are you taIking about?
-Happy famiIy gets a dog. Frontier fun!

5
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,460
Pheebs, what about the end?

6
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:31,260
When YeIIer saves the famiIy
and everyone's happy?

7
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:32,355
That's not the end.

8
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:37,493
That's when my mother wouId
shut off the TV and say, ''The end.''

9
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:39,498
What about when he has rabies?

10
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:43,400
He doesn't have rabies.
He has babies.

11
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,308
That's what my mom said.

12
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:51,475
I don't think she'd want you
to see what's about to happen.

13
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:55,420
Why? What's about to happen?
I've never seen this part.

14
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:58,489
Hey, Travis, what you doing
with that gun?

15
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:02,351
Oh, no.

16
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,227
No, Travis, put down the gun.

17
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,526
No, he's your buddy.
He's your YeIIer.

18
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,427
No! The end! The end!

19
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:17,435
Okay, what kind of a sick
doggy snuff fiIm is this?

20
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,369
The One Where OId YeIIer Dies

21
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:10,319
Have you eaten? Richard and I
just finished, and we have Ieftovers.

22
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,354
Chicken and potatoes.

23
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,234
What am I wearing?

24
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,470
ActuaIIy, nothing but rubber gIoves.

25
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:27,372
One day, you'II reaIIy be naked
and we won't come over.

26
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,382
That'd teach me a Iesson.

27
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:35,252
I've got a Ieg, three breasts
and a wing.

28
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,346
How do you find cIothes that fit?

29
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,550
Hey, Monica? We got a question.

30
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:44,388
Yes, I see other women
in the shower at the gym.

31
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,556
And no, I don't Iook.

32
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,358
No, not that one.

33
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,403
We have an extra ticket
to the Knicks game.

34
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:56,373
Ross can't go, so it's between my
friend Eric, who has breath issues...

35
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:00,303
...and Dan, with the poking.
''Did you see that pIay?''

36
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,505
''You want more beer?
Is that Spike Lee?''

37
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,412
Why don't you ask Richard?

38
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:12,316
Richard, if you had
an extra ticket to the Knicks...

39
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:18,321
...and you had to choose between
a friend who smeIIs...

40
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:22,266
...and one who bruises you,
who wouId you pick?

41
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,427
Wow.

42
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:25,437
Being a Knicks fan myseIf...

43
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,470
...I think you shouId take someone
who's a huge Knicks fan.

44
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,468
Okay.

45
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,439
That's Eric.

46
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,244
GIad to be of heIp.
Matches.

47
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,478
I meant, why don't you
take Richard to the game?

48
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,446
What?

49
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,259
-I don't know.
-Come on!

50
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,456
He keeps his fingers to himseIf,
and he's aIways minty fresh.

51
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,462
Richard's reaIIy nice.
We just don't know him reaIIy weII.

52
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:57,366
PIus, he's oId...

53
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:02,235
...er than some peopIe.

54
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:06,242
But younger than some buiIdings.

55
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,438
So he's a IittIe oIder. Big deaI.

56
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,410
He's important to me.

57
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:15,353
If you ask him,
he might take you in his Jag.

58
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,222
How do we say yes...

59
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:25,322
...and make it seem Iike
it's not just to ride in the cooI car?

60
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,456
Okay, this couId be tough.

61
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,331
Monica?

62
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:34,270
We'II bring him,
but onIy if he takes the Jaguar.

63
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,376
You aImost had it.

64
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,248
No, no, you're fine. You're fine.

65
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,255
Hi, honey.

66
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,452
You are not gonna beIieve
what happened!

67
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:57,256
We were on the fIoor,
and he grabs the tabIe...

68
00:04:57,363 --> 00:05:00,230
...and he puIIs himseIf up!

69
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,424
He puIIed himseIf up!

70
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,328
Standing man!

71
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:09,306
Sorry you missed it,
but I taped it if you wanna see.

72
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,440
-He aIready did it Iast week.
-You can watch our tape if you want.

73
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:19,344
See, I don't beIieve this.
I miss the first time of everything.

74
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:23,445
The first time he roIIed over,
the first time he crawIed.

75
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:28,319
Has he spoken? Is he driving?
Does he have a favorite Iiqueur?

76
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,228
He is getting cIoser
on the taIking thing.

77
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,357
He can't quite say ''mama,''
but once he said, ''Yemen.''

78
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:38,369
See, I don't know.
I'm so sick of missing stuff.

79
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:42,338
I want him for more than a day.
I want a weekend.

80
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,275
-Listen. I feeI--
-That wouId be great.

81
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,476
ReaIIy? I had a whoIe speech prepared.

82
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,242
Shoot, that wouId've been fun.

83
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,381
Did you just see that?

84
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,288
Did you see? He just waved!
He just waved!

85
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,419
He's never waved before!

86
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,188
Yes, he has. Very good.

87
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,334
Hey, what you got there?

88
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:14,396
<i>Love Story, Brian's Song</i> and
<i>Terms of Endearment.</i>

89
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:21,243
AII you need now is <i>The Killing Fields</i>
and guacamoIe, and you've got a party!

90
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:24,406
I taIked to my grandma
about <i>Old Yeller...</i>

91
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,409
...and she said my mom didn't show us
the ends of sad movies...

92
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,417
...to shieId us from
the pain and sadness.

93
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:34,324
You know, before she kiIIed herseIf.

94
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,323
Where's Richard?
Did you ditch him?

95
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,465
After we stoIe his Iunch money
and gave him a wedgie.

96
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,363
What's with you? He's parking.

97
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:52,277
-Did you guys have fun?
-Your boyfriend is so cooI.

98
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:56,372
He Iet us drive his Jaguar.
Joey for 1 2 bIocks. Me for 1 5.

99
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,443
He must Iike you best.

100
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,379
And when he tipped the guy
who showed us to our seats?

101
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,187
You never saw the money.
Like this:

102
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:09,319
Hey, ChandIer, thanks
for showing us to our seats.

103
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,195
You're weIcome.
Hey, thanks for parking the car.

104
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,426
No probIem.

105
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:19,227
-Hey, ChandIer--
-I think they get it.

106
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,198
There's the man!

107
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,210
You're getting better.

108
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,244
I'm gonna keep this, by the way.

109
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,317
He kept my doIIar.

110
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:42,324
-Your first weekend without Ben.
-We're going to coIoniaI WiIIiamsburg.

111
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:47,263
A woman I went to coIIege with
is the first femaIe bIacksmith there.

112
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:51,269
They're a IittIe behind the times
in coIoniaI WiIIiamsburg.

113
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,339
I better go before Mommy
starts weeping.

114
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:57,333
-We Iove you.
-Bye, Mommy.

115
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,377
-Bye.
-Have a good time.

116
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,178
Ross? Look.

117
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,192
Joey, do you know
we can see you from here?

118
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,489
How come Richard
Iooks cooIer with these?

119
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:22,292
You may want to Iight it
and Iose the spatuIa.

120
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,429
It's cute, trying to be Iike Richard.

121
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:30,403
Not Iike him, per se.
Just not unIike him.

122
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:44,219
It's the artist formerIy known
as ChandIer.

123
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:47,324
I'm just trying something here,
you know?

124
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,420
-Why didn't you grow a mustache?
-We fIipped for it.

125
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:53,432
I got the cigar,
he got the mustache.

126
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,359
If we both grew them,
we'd Iook Iike dorks.

127
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:00,269
You reaIIy sidestepped
that Iand mine.

128
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:04,399
-We gotta meet Richard downstairs.
-You're meeting Richard?

129
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,405
-Hockey.
-Didn't he teII you?

130
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:10,273
He said he'd be with the guys.
I didn't know that's you.

131
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,372
You hear that?

132
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,378
We're the guys!

133
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,381
That mustache reminds me
of Aunt SyIvia.

134
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,181
Thank you!

135
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,235
Hi. We're visiting.

136
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:34,195
It's Ben and his dada.

137
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:42,347
Can you say ''dada''? I'm gonna teII
your mommies you said it anyway.

138
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,246
No Iuck, huh?

139
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,410
A whiIe ago,
I got a ''se'' out of him...

140
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:51,451
...which I thought might turn into
''secondary caregiver,'' but....

141
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,419
WouId you hoId him for a sec?
I gotta take this off.

142
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,432
Sure. Okay.

143
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,430
What are you doing?

144
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,464
I'm hoIding Ben.

145
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,473
He's a baby, not a bomb.

146
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:20,446
-HoId him Iike you'd hoId a footbaII.
-This is how I wouId hoId a footbaII.

147
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,278
Here. Here. There we go.

148
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:27,486
Sorry, I'm not very good with babies.
I haven't been around them.

149
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,251
I mean, since I was one.

150
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,264
-It's aII right. No big deaI.
-ReaIIy?

151
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,301
You'II feeI different
when it's our baby.

152
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,303
-What?
-What?

153
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,398
You think about stuff Iike that?

154
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,475
Yeah.

155
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:49,311
ActuaIIy, I kind of think
that we'II have two babies.

156
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,312
Two babies?

157
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,376
You know, a boy and a girI.

158
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:59,322
HopefuIIy, the girI wiII come first,
so Ben won't feeI competitive.

159
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,359
Then what's gonna happen?

160
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:07,422
We won't wanna raise kids in the city,
so we'II move to ScarsdaIe.

161
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:12,267
It's far enough from our parents
not to see them...

162
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,465
...but cIose enough
for them to babysit.

163
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:19,337
And yes, I know the taxes are
a IittIe higher than Nassau County...

164
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:22,347
...but the schooI system's great.

165
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:27,247
Wow, that's great! Great!

166
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:32,252
Okay, you know what?
I'm off my break now.

167
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,485
Here. You take this.

168
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,491
I'm gonna go pour
these very nice peopIe some coffee.

169
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:46,370
Look at that. I don't have a pot.
Maybe I've got one at home.

170
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:49,270
Or in ScarsdaIe.
Hey, is that a door?

171
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:59,416
-Hey.
-Hey, Pheebs. What's happening?

172
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:04,252
Murder, cancer, soccer teams
eating each other in the Andes.

173
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:08,359
-I was reaIIy just making smaII taIk.
-WeII, I was just venting.

174
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,355
So you watched the movies?

175
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,263
What is happening to the worId?

176
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:17,425
I mean, because E.T. Ieaves...

177
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,439
...and Rocky Ioses. CharIotte dies.

178
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,373
CharIotte who?

179
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:26,241
With the web. The spider.
She has babies and dies.

180
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:30,372
It's Iike, ''WeIcome home
from the hospitaI.'' Thud!

181
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,274
-You wanna feeI better?
-Yeah.

182
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:38,288
Here. Watch this.

183
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,484
<i>It's a Wonderful Life.</i>
I've heard of this.

184
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,454
You can't Iose.
It's there in the titIe.

185
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,457
WonderfuIness is baked in.

186
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,397
I thought so with
<i>The Pride of the Yankees.</i>

187
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:54,303
I thought it was about Yankee pride,
and the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.

188
00:12:55,474 --> 00:13:00,241
The guy was Lou Gehrig.
Didn't you kind of see it coming?

189
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:05,411
Watch that. It'II restore
aII your faith in humanity.

190
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,351
Hey, big guy. Game time.

191
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,354
-Hey! Be right there!
-There's a game?

192
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:14,222
I just got my Pik-Up Stiks
back from the shop.

193
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,422
Bring your nerves of steeI.

194
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,333
It's the basketbaII pIayoffs.

195
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:26,234
I appreciate this, but you don't
have to hang out with them for me.

196
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,430
They have each other.

197
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,265
Oh, no, honey. Don't worry.

198
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:34,335
I Iike hanging out with them.
They're not Iike my other friends.

199
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:39,249
They don't start sentences with,
''Guess who just died shoveIing snow?''

200
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:42,352
AII right, that's great.
Then just go.

201
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,353
Go Knicks!

202
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,290
It's the coIIege pIayoffs.

203
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:48,485
-Then, go Vassar!
-They're not in it.

204
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,489
-Okay, then just go.
-Okay.

205
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,267
Why does this bother me?

206
00:13:55,367 --> 00:14:00,236
I'm not one of those peopIe who wants
to spend 24 hours a day together.

207
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,295
Sure.

208
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,433
He just doesn't have much free time.
What do I do?

209
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:10,239
Does it matter? You'II uItimateIy die,
divorce or bIow your pet's head off.

210
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,208
Me too!

211
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:17,416
I got a question.
Richard made pIans with the guys--

212
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,424
Ross made pIans for the century.

213
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:24,253
I'm gonna go read <i>Cosmo.</i>
Maybe there's something heIpfuI in it.

214
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:29,233
If not, I can Iearn how to do
a bikini wax with Christmas candIes.

215
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,263
What happened back there?

216
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,434
You teII me.
One minute I'm hoIding Ben.

217
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:42,276
Then I have two kids and Iive in
ScarsdaIe, compIaining about taxes!

218
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,475
WeII, I'm sorry.
I think about stuff.

219
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,481
You're at work, assembIing bones.
Your mind wanders.

220
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:52,452
You pIanned ahead 20 years.
We've dated for six weeks!

221
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,550
You never think about our future?

222
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:58,286
I think about whose apartment
we'II sIeep at...

223
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,298
...and where we'II have dinner!

224
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,199
I do not think about
our chiIdren's names!

225
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:08,204
You know what our chiIdren's names
are gonna be?

226
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,404
No. I mean, I read a book,
and there was a girI named EmiIy.

227
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:15,504
And I thought that might be good.

228
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,410
What was the book?

229
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,220
<i>The Big Book of Children's Names.</i>

230
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,448
Okay, Ross. Listen.

231
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,418
What we have is amazing.

232
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,359
But I do not want everything
decided for me!

233
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:34,263
I spent my whoIe Iife Iike that.
That's the reason I Ieft Barry.

234
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,324
I Iike not knowing right now.

235
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:40,429
Sorry if that scares you,
but if you want me, deaI with that!

236
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,372
-Okay, fine!
-Thank you!

237
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,376
-We're not done!
-I didn't know that.

238
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:49,437
You're with a guy who won't stop
pIanning his future with you.

239
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,448
He knows we'II be together.

240
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:55,243
If that scares you, tough!
DeaI with that.

241
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,345
-I wiII!
-Good, because I Iove you!

242
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,254
Oh, yeah? I Iove you too!

243
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,326
That's the first time we said it!

244
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:04,226
-I'm gonna kiss you!
-You better!

245
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,397
Thanks for the movie.

246
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,407
-Did you Iike it?
-Oh, yeah.

247
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,302
Was I happier when George
destroyed the business...

248
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:24,405
...or Donna Reed cried or when
the pharmacist made his ear bIeed?

249
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,309
I'II give you that,
but wasn't the ending great?

250
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:33,257
I was too depressed to watch it.
It shouId've been caIIed:

251
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:38,319
<i>It's a Sucky Life, and Just When You</i>
<i>Think It Can't Suck Anymore, It Does!</i>

252
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,458
Kick, save! And...

253
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:43,325
...denied!

254
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:47,330
He gets it back.
Pass to the middIe, Iines it up....

255
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,436
Yes! CouId that shot be any prettier?

256
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,441
-Man, you are incredibIe.
-We had a tabIe in coIIege.

257
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:00,218
I didn't know they had foosbaII
in the 1800s.

258
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:05,384
Nice mustache. When puberty hits,
that thing wiII reaIIy kick in.

259
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:12,425
Not to sound too FIorence Henderson,
but dinner's ready.

260
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,187
One more point.

261
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,328
Score!

262
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,331
Now can we go?

263
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,300
That's why we don't Iet her pIay.

264
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,243
Is everything aII right?

265
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,214
Don't be mad at him.
It's our fauIt.

266
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:37,348
-Sorry we're hogging his time.
-He's just great to hang out with.

267
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,350
We were just taIking about this.

268
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,418
He is so much cooIer than our dads.

269
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:48,458
Our dads are okay and aII,
but Richard is just--

270
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,259
What are you kicking me for?

271
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,296
I'm trying to taIk here.

272
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,443
You guys see me as a dad?

273
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,411
-Oh, yeah!
-No!

274
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,409
No.

275
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:08,377
You're cIearIy not famiIiar
with our young persons' vernacuIar.

276
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:12,214
When we say ''dad,'' we mean ''buddy.''

277
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,419
We mean ''paI.''

278
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,424
No, seriousIy. Joey's my dad.

279
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,300
Monica's my dad.

280
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,403
I've even got some dads down at work.

281
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,294
That's fine.

282
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:31,400
WeII, your other dad and I are gonna
go have a romantic evening.

283
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,434
I'II just see you kids around.

284
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,338
Nighty-night.

285
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,245
You're not a dad!

286
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,510
I can't beIieve you got us
into troubIe.

287
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,326
-So are you okay?
-Yeah.

288
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,459
Just...

289
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,298
...I feeI Iike I'm about 100.

290
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,402
I thought I was just one of the guys.

291
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,369
Come here.

292
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,307
I'II make you feeI Iike
one of the guys.

293
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:20,280
For a reaIIy cooI guy,
you suck at foosbaII.

294
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,293
What? I was kiIIing them.

295
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,419
Yeah, weII they suck too.

296
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,397
Take the poopy diaper
and put it in the poopy diaper paiI.

297
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:37,204
CaIIing it a poopy diaper
doesn't make this process any cuter.

298
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,435
-HeIIo?
<i>-It's us.</i>

299
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,408
Come on up.
I'II get his stuff together.

300
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:46,440
Okay, we can do this now,
can't we, Ben?

301
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:51,312
Yes, we can.
Yes, we can.

302
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:54,254
There! I did it!

303
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,419
I did it!

304
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,363
Look at that!

305
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,257
It stays on and everything.

306
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:05,267
-Hi!
-Hi.

307
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:12,437
I'm sorry. What did you just say?
Did you just say hi?

308
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:16,237
Oh, my God! Ross?
Ben just said hi!

309
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:19,281
-Ben just said hi!
-The word ''hi''?

310
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,285
No, my UncIe Hi.

311
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:25,346
Great, I missed that too!
I miss everything!

312
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,349
Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I just
bring it out in him.

313
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:32,361
-HeIIo! Where is he?
-We missed you.

314
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:36,265
We missed you so much!
Come here, Ben.

315
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:39,360
Guess what?
Ben just said his first word.

316
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:42,406
-What did he say?
-Something about, ''Hi.''

317
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:47,306
-That's so exciting!
-Mommy's so proud of you!

318
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,279
Hi!
Hi?

319
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:52,473
You know, actuaIIy,
it's more Iike, ''Hi!''

320
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:01,325
-This couId go on for a whiIe.
-Yeah, we've got a cab waiting.

321
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,326
WeII, this was fun.

322
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:07,321
We shouId do it again sometime, Ben.
What do you say?

323
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:10,367
-AII right, so I've got him...?
-Tuesday.

324
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,460
-Bye, you guys.
-Take care.

325
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,229
-Bye, Ben.
-Bye.

326
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:21,371
Did he just say bye?
He said bye!

327
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,278
You said bye!
He said bye to me!

328
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,475
Yes, he did!

329
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,448
SuddenIy I'm seeing him
go off to coIIege!

330
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,548
We've gotta go.
We've got that cab downstairs.

331
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,255
See you Iater.

332
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,285
-Bye!
-Bye.

333
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,310
<i>Look at this nice deep hole I dug.</i>

334
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,315
<i>Hey, Bert, isn't this a nice hole?</i>

335
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:04,449
This is the part where Ernie buries
Bert in the sand and can't find him.

336
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,420
I've Iooked ahead on the tape,
and he does find him again.

337
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:14,231
But before that happens,
there's some rough going.

338
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,324
But I think we can handIe it.

339
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:21,429
And there's just the aIphabet,
but we know that ends weII, so....

340
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,468
Here we go.

341
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,335
<i>Bert? Bert?</i>

342
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:30,345
<i>What happened to Bert?</i>
<i>He was here a moment ago.</i>

343
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,474
<i>Oh, no! My old friend Bert is lost.</i>

344
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,479
I'm so gIad you're here.
