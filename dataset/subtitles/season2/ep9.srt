1
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:09,238
UgIy Naked Guy is decorating his tree.

2
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:13,438
And oh, my God, you shouId see
the size of his Christmas baIIs!

3
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:18,442
Hey. How much did
you guys tip the super?

4
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:22,351
We were gonna give 50
but we don't wanna Iook bad.

5
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:27,256
-This year we made him cookies.
-And 25 it is.

6
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:32,254
-You gave him cookies?
-Money is so impersonaI.

7
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,357
Cookies says someone reaIIy cares.

8
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:39,302
AII right, we're broke.
But cookies do say that.

9
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:43,502
I can see that. A pIate of brownies
once toId me a Iimerick.

10
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:49,378
Pheebs, Iet me ask you,
were these ''funny'' brownies?

11
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:51,573
Not especiaIIy.

12
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,411
But I think they had pot in them.

13
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:00,417
So who eIse did you tip with cookies?

14
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:03,257
The maiIman, the super....

15
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:06,455
And the newspaper deIivery guy.

16
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,234
Oh, my God.

17
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:13,433
-What?
-I don't think you're gonna Iike this.

18
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:19,376
There's a cookie smashed
to the sports section.

19
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,380
He did my crossword puzzIe.

20
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:25,475
Yeah, but not very weII, unIess
1 4 across, ''Gershwin musicaI''...

21
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:29,449
...actuaIIy is ''Bite me,
bite me, bite me.''

22
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,349
The One With Phoebe's Dad

23
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,337
I can't beIieve
it's Christmas aIready.

24
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,342
One day you're eating turkey,
the next thing you know...

25
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:27,369
...Iords are a-Ieaping
and geese are a-Iaying.

26
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:32,342
Which is why geese are
so reIaxed this time of year.

27
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,447
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

28
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:41,353
Hey, Rach.
I got you a IittIe present.

29
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,397
I'II open it.

30
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:50,266
It's a SIinky! Remember?

31
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,362
<i>Walks downstairs</i>
<i>Alone or in pairs</i>

32
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:55,270
<i>Everyone knows it's--</i>

33
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,401
Just a big spring.

34
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:03,438
-You're stiII mad because of the--
-List of reasons not to be with me?

35
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,311
How about we just caII it
the ''unfortunate incident''?

36
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:13,224
Gunther, you got stairs in your pIace?

37
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,419
-Yeah.
-Go nuts.

38
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,524
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

39
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,459
-What's in the bag?
-Just some presents.

40
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,262
Come on, show us what you bought.

41
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,341
You know you want to.

42
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,232
Okay.

43
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,473
This is a picture frame
from Ben to my parents.

44
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,376
Oh, that's cute.

45
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:43,286
Some ''Hers'' and ''Hers'' toweIs
for Susan and CaroI.

46
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:48,350
And I got this bIouse for Mom.

47
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:53,354
Ross, that is gorgeous!
Look at these authentic fake medaIs!

48
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:59,360
Mom's gonna be voted ''Best Dressed''
at the make-beIieve miIitary academy.

49
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,302
-Happy ''Christmas Eve Eve.''
-You too.

50
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,404
Oh, my God!
Where did you get this?

51
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:10,307
Macy's, third fIoor,
Home Furnishings.

52
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:14,512
This is my father!
This is a picture of my dad.

53
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,452
That's the guy
that comes in the frame.

54
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,319
No, it's my dad.
I'II show you.

55
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:26,364
-I thought your dad was in prison.
-No, that's my stepdad.

56
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:30,425
My reaI dad's the one that
ran out on us before I was born.

57
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,371
How have you never been on <i>Oprah</i>?

58
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,265
Look, see? This is him.

59
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:40,472
My mother gave me this picture
before she died. Same guy!

60
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:48,448
It's a picture of the frame guy posing
in front of a bIue screen with a dog.

61
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,258
It's not a bIue screen.
It's just....

62
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:55,452
Maybe it was just
reaIIy cIear that day.

63
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,298
Okay, I have to taIk
to my grandmother.

64
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,392
-Wait a minute, honey.
-Pheebs!

65
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:11,209
So I'm trying to get my boss' ex-wife
to sIeep with me.

66
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,335
Joey!

67
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:17,313
But when Phoebe has a probIem,
everyone's aII ears.

68
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,251
Esther Livingston.

69
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,246
Gone!

70
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,224
Hi, Pooh.

71
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,319
Hi, Gram. What you doing?

72
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,366
Just updating the phone book.

73
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:39,227
Gram? Can I see the pictures
of my dad again?

74
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:42,341
Oh. Oh, sure, sure.

75
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,474
-How come?
-Just, you know, to see him.

76
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,238
Sure. Yeah.

77
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:54,386
This is the one
of your father in a meadow.

78
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:59,290
And heIping a IittIe boy fIy a kite.

79
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:03,190
And here he is at a graduation.

80
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,222
Another graduation.

81
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,201
Another graduation.

82
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,206
Is this reaIIy my father?

83
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:19,435
Is it reaIIy your fa--?
WeII, of course it is.

84
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:25,350
I smeII smoke. Maybe because
someone's pants are on fire!

85
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,447
AII the time we've been
grandmother and granddaughter...

86
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,224
...you've never Iied to me.

87
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:37,422
AII right, that's not your father.
It's a picture of a guy in a frame.

88
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,227
Oh, God.

89
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,434
It was your mother's idea.

90
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:47,428
She didn't want you to know your reaI
father because he hurt her so much.

91
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,467
I didn't want to do it.

92
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:54,440
But then she died
and it was harder to argue with her.

93
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,374
Not impossibIe, but harder.

94
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:02,217
AII right. So he's not
a famous tree surgeon?

95
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:10,490
And I guess he doesn't Iive in a hut
in Burma where there's no phones?

96
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:14,425
Last I heard, he was
a pharmacist somewhere upstate.

97
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:20,195
That makes no sense. Why wouId
the viIIagers worship a pharmacist?

98
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,402
Honey.

99
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,211
Oh. Yeah.

100
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:30,204
Anyway, that's aII I know.

101
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:33,445
That...

102
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,322
...and this.

103
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,315
This...

104
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:44,262
...is the reaI him.

105
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:53,362
I remember my father dressed
in the red suit, the bIack boots...

106
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:57,375
...and the patent Ieather beIt,
sneaking around.

107
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:00,378
He didn't want us to see
but he'd be drunk...

108
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,405
...so he'd crash into something
and wake everyone.

109
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,209
That doesn't sound Iike
a very merry Christmas.

110
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,379
Who said anything about Christmas?

111
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,226
-Hi.
-Anyone hear from Phoebe yet?

112
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,386
No, nothing.

113
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:20,427
-I hope she's okay.
-I know what she's going through.

114
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,191
How do you know that?

115
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,395
She toId us.

116
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:31,299
-What you got there, Monica?
-Party stuff.

117
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,311
Aren't you guys supposed
to be shopping?

118
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:39,250
You didn't buy presents? Tomorrow's
Christmas Eve! What are you gonna do?

119
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:43,311
Don't you have to be CIaymation
to say stuff Iike that?

120
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,315
I don't think the maiIman
Iiked your cookies.

121
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,352
Here are the ornaments your mom sent.

122
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:57,464
Maybe the maiIman Iiked them.
We just didn't give him enough.

123
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,297
Monica, pigeons Iearn faster than you.

124
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:13,309
Hey, Rach. I think I know
what wiII make you feeI better.

125
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,287
How about you make a Iist about me?

126
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,291
Forget it. I'm not gonna stand here
and make a Iist--

127
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,317
Okay, you're whiny...

128
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:27,332
...you are obsessive.
You are insecure. You're gutIess.

129
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,198
You never just seize the day.

130
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:34,195
You Iiked me for a year
and you didn't do anything about it.

131
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:37,435
And you wear too much
of that geI in your hair.

132
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:45,411
See, there, you....
AII right, you did what I said.

133
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:51,412
And you know what? You're right.
I do feeI better. Thank you, Ross.

134
00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:01,232
Yeah, in AIbany. CouId I have
the number of Frank Buffay?

135
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,527
Okay. In Ithaca?

136
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:08,338
AII right, Saratoga?

137
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,442
Oneonta?

138
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,440
You know what? You shouIdn't
caII yourseIf ''Information''!

139
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:25,246
HeIIo, Grandma. If that is,
in fact, your reaI name.

140
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:29,452
Come on now, Pooh.
Don't stiII be mad at me.

141
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,457
-How's it going?
-Not so good.

142
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:37,493
Upstate's pretty big.
He's pretty smaII. You do the math.

143
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,398
WeII, I think you're better off
without him.

144
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,498
Honey, I know he's your daddy.

145
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:48,279
But to me,
he's stiII the irresponsibIe creep...

146
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,477
...who Iocked up your mom
and stoIe her GremIin.

147
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:56,479
I know. I just wanted to know
who he was, you know?

148
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,323
Yeah, I know.

149
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:07,228
Okay. I wasn't compIeteIy honest
with you when I said I didn't know...

150
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,426
...exactIy where he Iived.

151
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,333
What do you mean?

152
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:17,239
He Iives at 74 LaureI Drive
in MiddIetown.

153
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:22,442
If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've
gone too far. You can take my cab.

154
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:26,247
Wow! Thank you.

155
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,449
Remember, nobody eIse drives that cab.

156
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:34,448
Got it.
Oh, I'm gonna see my dad!

157
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,461
Thank you.

158
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:42,265
Wish me Iuck, Grandpa.

159
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,569
Phoebe here with the cab yet?

160
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:57,313
Yeah, she brought the invisibIe cab.
Hop in!

161
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,411
She'd better come.
The stores cIose at 7.

162
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:05,447
It'II be two hours to Phoebe's dad's
house. They'II meet, swap stories.

163
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:11,321
Even if she teIIs the one where she's
an Egyptian sIave, we'II have time.

164
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,358
-Hey, here she comes!
-Hey.

165
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:26,468
Can you beIieve this?
In two hours I'm gonna have a dad.

166
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:31,243
-Yeah, big stuff!
-Okay, Iet's go!

167
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,251
Here, you have to hoId this.

168
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,446
''Brake Ieft, gas right''?

169
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:42,292
Yeah, that's my cheat sheet.

170
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,398
-Where's my seat beIt?
-There isn't one.

171
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:50,401
The paramedics had to cut through it.

172
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,217
Come on, just teII me.
PIease, pIease!

173
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:09,310
For the 1 6th time:
No, I do not think you're obsessive!

174
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,417
It's hot in here!

175
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,360
Rach, get the heat.
Ross, turn the heat down, pIease?

176
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:20,262
-The difference between obsessive--
-Ross, the heat!

177
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:24,530
Okay! Heat, heat, heat!
And I'm the obsessive one?

178
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:28,372
Okay. This way is on.

179
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,341
So this is...

180
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,345
...off.

181
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:41,342
-Did you just break the radiator?
-No, I was turning the knob and...

182
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,455
...here it is.

183
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,349
WeII, put it back!

184
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:52,296
-It won't go back.
-I'II caII the super.

185
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,490
Here, Iet me try.

186
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:58,362
That's right. I forgot about
your abiIity to fuse metaI.

187
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,337
Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny!

188
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,302
Hi, Mr. Treeger?
It's RacheI Greene from upstairs.

189
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:09,211
Yes, somebody broke our knob
on the radiator...

190
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:12,216
...and it's reaIIy hot in here.

191
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:16,254
Yes, it's hot enough to bake cookies.

192
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:20,255
Do you think we couId
have a new one by 6?

193
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:24,455
Tuesday? We can't wait untiI then.
We're having a party tonight.

194
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,357
Okay, tip the man.

195
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:30,459
If he doesn't Iike our cookies,
too bad! I won't be bIackmaiIed.

196
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,535
Look, if it gets a IittIe warm,
it can be a theme party.

197
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:39,233
Here's a theme:
''Come on in! Live Iike bacon!''

198
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,340
This is it, 74!

199
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:49,254
Oh, so that's what this is for.

200
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:52,480
This is it. I'm gonna meet my dad.

201
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,490
-This is Iike the biggest thing ever.
-Sure is.

202
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,288
Okay, here I go. I'm going in.

203
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,423
-AII right!
-Good Iuck, Pheebs.

204
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,397
Okay. Here I go.

205
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,297
Here I go.

206
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,309
I'm going.

207
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:28,223
Hi. WeIcome to our tropicaI
Christmas party.

208
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,323
You can put your coats, sweaters,
pants and shirts in the bedroom.

209
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:39,532
It's hard to teII because I'm sweating
but I use what the geI bottIe says.

210
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:46,470
An amount about the size of a pea.
How can that be too much?

211
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,279
Ice?

212
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:56,287
Ice? Ice squares anyone?
Take a napkin. AII right.

213
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,347
Monica!

214
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,327
Monica, your guests
are turning into jerky.

215
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:05,329
ReaIIy? I'm perfectIy comfortabIe.

216
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:09,197
Hey! Get in Iine, buddy.
I was next.

217
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:15,396
-Mr. Treeger.
-You said there was a party.

218
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:19,400
Oh. Yeah.
WeII, hey, weIcome to our sauna.

219
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:23,211
Is it hot?
My body aIways stays cooI.

220
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,409
ProbabIy because I have so much skin.

221
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,318
Hey, cheese!

222
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,452
Here's the chance.
Monica, give him cash.

223
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:36,217
RacheI, give him your earrings.
Anything!

224
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,229
-No, I wiII not cave.
-I'm with Mon.

225
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:42,427
AII right. You know how you say
I never seize the day?

226
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:46,231
Even though he's your super,
I'm seizing.

227
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,434
Mr. Treeger?

228
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,243
Here is $50. Merry Christmas.

229
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,542
Oh, wow. I didn't get you anything.

230
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,273
Here's five back.

231
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:02,384
No, that's your Christmas tip.

232
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:07,255
Do you think there's a chance
you can fix that radiator now?

233
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:12,320
No can do. Like I toId the girI,
I can't get a knob untiI Tuesday.

234
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:16,198
Ross?
Looks Iike he's pIaying basebaII.

235
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,236
You mean hardbaII?

236
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,330
Whatever.

237
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:26,436
-Whatcha gonna do?
-Excuse me. I'm seizing.

238
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,440
Mr. Treeger?

239
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:33,249
Here's another 50.
Happy Hanukkah.

240
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:36,310
WiII this heIp with the knob-getting?

241
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:41,256
No, the pIace is not open
tiII Tuesday.

242
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,453
Am I not saying it right?

243
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,261
So you reaIIy did Iike my cookies?

244
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:52,360
Yeah, they were so personaI.
It reaIIy showed you cared.

245
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,376
Nice seizing...

246
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,309
...geI boy.

247
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,409
So is this mistIetoe?

248
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,387
No, that....

249
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,186
That is basiI.

250
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:20,289
If it was mistIetoe,
I was gonna kiss you.

251
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,233
No, it's stiII basiI.

252
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,341
Okay.

253
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,242
-How far did you get?
-MaiIbox.

254
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,312
AII right, we're getting cIoser.

255
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,324
What's going on?

256
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,327
It's just Iike a whoIe mess of stuff.

257
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:55,264
Like yesterday, my dad was this
famous Burma tree-surgeon guy.

258
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,462
And you know, now he's
a pharmacist guy and....

259
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:03,197
WeII, maybe he's this
reaIIy cooI pharmacist guy.

260
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:07,371
Yeah, maybe!
And I'II knock on the door...

261
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,206
...and he'II hug me
and I'II have a dad!

262
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:15,185
I'II go to his pharmacy and
everyone wiII be nice to me...

263
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,222
...because, you know,
I'm Frank's daughter.

264
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,191
So why not go knock?

265
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:28,425
Because, I mean, what if
he's not this great-dad guy?

266
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:33,432
What if he's stiII the dirt-bag
who ran out on my mom and us?

267
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,299
Yeah.

268
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,308
You know what?

269
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:44,211
I've aIready Iost
a fake dad this week.

270
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:48,243
I don't think I'm ready
to Iose a reaI one.

271
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:53,423
Pheebs, that's okay.
You took a big step today.

272
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,324
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

273
00:19:56,428 --> 00:20:00,364
Someday, when you're ready,
you'II make it past the hedges.

274
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:04,232
And when you do,
he'II be Iucky to have you.

275
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,462
You guys....

276
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,441
Sorry about your shopping.

277
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:15,344
Oh, that's okay.
We'II figure something out.

278
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,374
I know you're not going in there...

279
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:23,477
...but wouId it be okay if I went in
and used his bathroom?

280
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,390
That's fine, never mind.

281
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,357
CooI, snow!

282
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,261
Kind of Iike a bIank canvas.

283
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:44,465
Ho-ho-ho-hoIy crap,
is it hot in here!

284
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,280
Mind if I turn the heat down?

285
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,475
We couId have used
that kind of thinking earIier!

286
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,508
So, Pheebs, how did it go?

287
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,278
Oh, I couIdn't go in.

288
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,381
-Honey, I'm sorry.
-Are you okay?

289
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,325
Yeah, it's okay
because I know he's there.

290
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,329
So that's enough for now.

291
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,455
It's after midnight!
Merry Christmas, everyone!

292
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:11,327
Oh, right! Merry Christmas!

293
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:18,369
The knob was broken so I turned it off
from underneath. I hope that's okay.

294
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,381
Thanks.

295
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:35,449
I guess that just Ieaves the gifts
from Joey and ChandIer.

296
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,464
Rach, these are for you.

297
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:44,458
Wiper bIades!
I don't even have a car.

298
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:49,263
No, but with this new-car smeII,
you'II think you do!

299
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,268
Okay, Pheebs, your turn.

300
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,477
ToiIet-seat covers!

301
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:08,318
Is that what you were doing
whiIe I was getting gas? You guys!

302
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:09,451
And for Ross...

303
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,321
...Mr. Sweet Tooth.

304
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,368
You got me a coIa drink?

305
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,371
And a Iemon-Iime!

306
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:27,334
WeII, this is too much! I feeI Iike
I shouId get you another sweater.

307
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,349
And Iast but not Ieast....

308
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,481
They're ribbed for your pIeasure!
