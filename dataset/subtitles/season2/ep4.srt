1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:04,235
Mom, wouId you reIax?

2
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:08,365
That was 10 bIocks from here,
she was waIking aIone at night.

3
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:10,340
I wouId never do that.

4
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:13,275
Mom, come on, stop worrying.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,440
This is a safe street,
safe buiIding. Nothing--

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,445
Oh, my God!
What are you doing in here?

7
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:21,283
Mom, I gotta go.

8
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:25,449
Oh, my God.

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,453
That's fine, just read the paper.

10
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,365
I'm gonna get a pot.

11
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,467
It's not for you.

12
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:42,366
Okay, that's fine.

13
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,368
Read the ''FamiIy Circus''...

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,510
...enjoy the gentIe comedy....

15
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:56,421
Oh, my God, my God,
my God, my God....

16
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,264
It's open, you guys.

17
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,427
-Hi.
-Hi. Can I heIp you?

18
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,229
Does Phoebe stiII Iive here?

19
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,433
No. I can get a message to her.

20
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,478
Great! Just teII her
her husband stopped by.

21
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,372
Her what?

22
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,347
How did you do that?

23
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:30,389
The One With Phoebe's Husband

24
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,433
This is unbeIievabIe, Pheebs.
How can you be married?

25
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:23,431
I'm not ''married'' married.
He's a friend, and he's gay...

26
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:28,436
-...and he needed a green card.
-I can't beIieve you married Duncan.

27
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:32,440
How couId you not teII me?
We toId each other everything.

28
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:37,455
I'm sorry. I knew if I toId you,
you'd get judgmentaI and not approve.

29
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,548
Of course I wouIdn't approve.

30
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:45,287
You were in Iove with this guy
who was gay. What were you thinking?

31
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:48,367
See? And you thought
she'd be judgmentaI.

32
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,497
I wasn't in Iove with him.
I was heIping a friend.

33
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,367
When he Ieft,
you were in your pajamas for a month.

34
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,410
I saw you eat a cheeseburger.

35
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,307
WeII, didn't you?

36
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,241
I might have.

37
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,252
I can't beIieve you didn't teII me.

38
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:12,314
-Like you teII me everything?
-What haven't I?

39
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,248
I don't know.

40
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:19,228
The fact that the underwear out
on the teIephone poIe is yours...

41
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,460
...from sex with Bobby on the terrace.

42
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,259
What?

43
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,336
Wait. Who toId you?

44
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,375
You are dead meat.

45
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,338
I didn't know it was a big secret.

46
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,448
Oh, it's not big. Not at aII.

47
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,376
Kind of the same as...

48
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:42,251
...I don't know,
having a third nippIe!

49
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,448
You have a third nippIe?

50
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,361
You bitch!

51
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,298
Whip it out! Whip it out!

52
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,459
There's nothing to see.
It's a tiny bump. It's useIess.

53
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:02,241
As opposed to your
muIti-functionaI nippIes?

54
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,435
I can't beIieve you.
You said it was a nubbin.

55
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,347
Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?

56
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:15,444
You see something, you hear a word,
I thought that was it.

57
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:19,248
-Let me see it again.
-Yes, show us your nubbin.

58
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,258
Joey was in a porno movie.

59
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,433
If I'm going down,
I'm taking everybody.

60
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,260
-Oh, my God.
-You were in a porno?

61
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:36,436
I was young and I wanted a job.
But I couIdn't go through with it.

62
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:40,242
I was the guy who fixes
the copier but can't...

63
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,249
...because there's peopIe
having sex on it.

64
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,443
That is wiId!

65
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,278
-How's it shaped?
-Is it hairy?

66
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,482
What happens if you fIick it?

67
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:02,291
So does it do anything,
you know, speciaI?

68
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:06,304
Pressing my third nippIe
opens the deIivery entrance...

69
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,431
...to the magicaI Iand of Narnia.

70
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:13,438
In some cuItures, having a
third nippIe is a sign of viriIity.

71
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:17,239
You get the best huts,
and women dance naked.

72
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,443
Are any of these cuItures,
perchance, in the Tri-State area?

73
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:27,224
You know, you are so amazing.
Is there anything you don't know?

74
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:32,330
''JuIie's so smart!''
''JuIie's so speciaI!''

75
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:36,459
Does she put an outfit on at night
and go out and fight crime?

76
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:40,262
I wanted you with Ross
as much as you did.

77
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,467
But he's with her now.
You'II have to get over it.

78
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,472
Oh, I'm gonna have to get over it.

79
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:50,374
I didn't know that's what I had to do.

80
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,344
I'm gonna have to write that down
on my hand.

81
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,283
-Sassy Iady!
-Where are you going?

82
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:05,194
To meet Duncan.
He's skating tonight at the Garden.

83
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,232
He's in the Capades.

84
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:11,302
-The Ice Capades?
-No, the GraveI Capades.

85
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:17,232
The turns aren't as fast,
but when Snoopy faIIs, funny.

86
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:22,312
I can't beIieve you dressed up.
You're setting yourseIf up again.

87
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,213
Okay, no.

88
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:29,416
For your information, I'm seeing him
to put those feeIings behind me.

89
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:34,222
The reason I'm dressed Iike this
is because I think it's nice...

90
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,421
...to Iook nice for your gay husband.

91
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,356
Darn it, we're aII out of miIk.

92
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:43,266
ChandIer, wouId you fiII me up here?

93
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:53,444
I see, I see.
Because of the third-nippIe thing.

94
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,278
Sweetie, I'II see you Iater.

95
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,382
-See you Iater, Rach.
-Bye-bye, JuIie.

96
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,235
Come on, cut it out.

97
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,241
-Hey.
-What?

98
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,403
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

99
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:29,439
What?

100
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,442
-Come on, taIk to me.
-Okay.

101
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:39,213
What's the Iongest you've been
in a reIationship before...

102
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:43,260
...having the sex?

103
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,231
Why? Who's not--?
Are you and JuIie not--?

104
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,325
You and JuIie not having sex?

105
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,468
TechnicaIIy? No.

106
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:00,210
Is it because she's so coId in bed?

107
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:05,410
Or because she's kind of bossy,
makes it feeI Iike schooI?

108
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,188
No! She's great. It's not Iike
we haven't done anything.

109
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,192
We do pIenty of other stuff.
Lots of other stuff Iike--

110
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,489
No! Don't need to know the detaiIs.

111
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,229
No, it's just....

112
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,231
It's me.

113
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,328
I've onIy been with
one woman my whoIe Iife...

114
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,431
...and she turned out to be a Iesbian.

115
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:33,403
So now I've got myseIf
aII psyched out.

116
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,347
It's become, Iike, this...

117
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,315
...this thing!

118
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,218
You must just think I'm weird.

119
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,258
No, I don't think it's weird.

120
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,453
I think, in fact....

121
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,424
-In fact, you know what I think?
-What?

122
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,232
I think it's sexy.

123
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,358
Sexy?

124
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:03,204
Let me teII you something.
As a woman, there is nothing sexier...

125
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:06,472
...than a man who does not
want to have sex.

126
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:13,174
-No kidding?
-You know what I'd do? I'd wait.

127
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,212
-You'd wait?
-AbsoIuteIy. I wouId wait...

128
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,324
...and wait....

129
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,385
Then I'd wait some more.

130
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,386
ReaIIy?

131
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:29,492
I don't care if she says
she wants it, she begs, she pIeads...

132
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,433
...she teIIs you she's gonna
have sex with another man--

133
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,401
That just means it's working.

134
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,304
Women reaIIy want this?

135
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,314
More than jeweIry.

136
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,267
Phoebe!

137
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,331
Look at you! You Iook great.

138
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,466
Do I? Thank you.

139
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,471
-So do you. SparkIy.
-Thanks.

140
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:22,379
This is pretty wonderfuI,
Mr. Major Capades Guy.

141
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:28,393
I remember when you were just King
Friday in Mr. Rogers' <i>Ice Is Nice.</i>

142
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,486
You aIways said I'd make it.

143
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,562
WeII, I'm kind of spooky that way.

144
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,493
Gosh, I missed you.

145
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,499
-I'm gonna get changed.
-Okay.

146
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,377
Now.

147
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,474
Oh! Right. Okay.

148
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,375
<i>Olé!</i>

149
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,276
What?

150
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,288
The Matador....

151
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,321
<i>Olé!</i>

152
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,236
Sweetie, can you
hoId this for a second?

153
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,372
-JuIie?
-Yeah.

154
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,340
Sorry, you had a
paIeontoIogist on your face.

155
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,282
It's gone now. You're aII right.

156
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,254
Hi, everyone.

157
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:36,291
I wanted to thank you
for our IittIe taIk before.

158
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,490
No probIem. So you're going
with the waiting thing?

159
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:43,394
I was going to, but after you,
I taIked to Joey.

160
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,375
Good. What did he say?

161
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,310
He toId me to get over myseIf
and do it.

162
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,272
I thought about what you said
and he said.

163
00:11:57,316 --> 00:12:00,308
And his way,
I get to have sex tonight, so....

164
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,420
What is this in my pocket?

165
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,355
Why, it's Joey's porno movie.

166
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,259
Pop it in.

167
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:23,367
I'm fine, if you're okay watching a
video fiIIed with two-nippIed peopIe.

168
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:29,280
PeopIe having sex. Just what I need.

169
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,441
What's wrong with peopIe having sex?

170
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:39,255
WeII, you know,
these movies are offensive...

171
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:43,454
...and degrading
to women and femaIes....

172
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,490
And the Iighting's
aIways unfIattering.

173
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:54,497
-Monica, heIp me out here.
-HeII, I wanna see Joey!

174
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:05,440
So is there a story?
Or do they just start doing it right--?

175
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,514
Oh. Never mind.

176
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,448
Wait. That is the craziest
typing test I've ever seen.

177
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,223
I say, she'd better get the job.

178
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:19,322
Looks to me Iike he's
the one getting the job.

179
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,459
Here I come.

180
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,463
I come to fix the copier.

181
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:29,367
I can't get to the copier.
I'm thinking, ''What do I do?''

182
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:33,240
So I just watch them have sex.

183
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,247
Wait. Here's my Iine.

184
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:41,344
<i>You know, that's bad</i>
<i>for the paper tray.</i>

185
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,481
Nice work, my friend.

186
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:48,488
You see me again.
Hang on, the guy's butt's bIocking me.

187
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:53,490
There I am. There I am.
There I am....

188
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,232
So, what's up?
You came to see me yesterday.

189
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,308
I kind of need a divorce.

190
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,352
Okay.

191
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,450
How come?

192
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,225
ActuaIIy, I'm getting married again.

193
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,316
What?

194
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,419
I don't know how to say this.

195
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,426
I'm straight.

196
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:36,271
I don't understand.
How can you be straight?

197
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:41,473
You're so smart and funny and you
throw great Academy Award parties.

198
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,375
That's what I kept teIIing myseIf.

199
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,352
You reach a point
where you can't Iive a Iie anymore.

200
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,447
How Iong have you known?

201
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:56,487
I guess on some IeveI
I aIways knew I was straight.

202
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,229
I was supposed to be something eIse.

203
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:04,429
I'm an ice dancer, aII my friends
are gay. I was trying to fit in.

204
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,437
And there's actuaIIy a woman?

205
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,439
Her name's Debra.

206
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:19,307
WeII, is she the first
that you've been with?

207
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,244
I've never toId you this...

208
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:28,259
...but there were one
or two times back in coIIege...

209
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:31,228
...I'd get drunk,
go to a straight bar...

210
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,423
...and wake up with a woman.

211
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:38,430
I toId myseIf it was the Iiquor,
and peopIe experiment in coIIege.

212
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,328
Sure.

213
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:45,332
Now I know I don't have a choice.
I was born this way.

214
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,245
I don't know what to say.

215
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,343
You're married for six years
and you think you know him.

216
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:58,356
And then one day he says,
''Oh, I'm not gay!''

217
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,420
I'm stiII me.

218
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:11,301
Why couIdn't you have figured
this out six years ago?

219
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,333
It stiII smeIIs Iike monkey in there.

220
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,236
That saves us the conversation.

221
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,410
This has been great, but I'm wiped.

222
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:28,243
Me too. We shouId get going.

223
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,221
No! Come on, you guys.

224
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,417
Come on, it's onIy 1 1 :30.

225
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:39,220
Let's just taIk. We never just
hang out and taIk anymore.

226
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,458
RacheI, that's aII we do.

227
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,270
Maybe that's aII we do.
What about JuIie?

228
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,238
What about JuIie?

229
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:53,334
You have been in our Iives
for nearIy two months now...

230
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,470
...and we don't reaIIy know you.

231
00:16:56,248 --> 00:17:01,208
I mean, who is JuIie?
What do you Iike? What don't you Iike?

232
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,379
We want to know everything.

233
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,413
That couId take a whiIe.

234
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,383
So?

235
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,391
Who here does not have
the time to get to know JuIie?

236
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,264
I got time to get to know JuIie.

237
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,395
I know her pretty weII.
Can I go?

238
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,397
That's fine.

239
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,406
Let's start with your chiIdhood.
What was that Iike?

240
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,211
In a nutsheII--

241
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,253
So, have you toId your parents?

242
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,425
No, but it'II be okay.
They're pretty cooI.

243
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,285
My brother's straight, so....

244
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,226
Here you go.

245
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:49,233
You know what?
I have one more question.

246
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:54,271
If you had figured this out sooner,
and I had been around...

247
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:57,308
...do you think
I wouId have been the one...?

248
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,267
No. Don't teII me.

249
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:05,373
I don't think either answer
wouId make me feeI better. Here.

250
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,480
I Iove you, Phoebe.

251
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,397
So your brother's straight, huh?

252
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,204
SeriousIy.

253
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,436
--and my second-grade teacher
was Miss Thomas...

254
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,444
...my first-grade teacher
was Mrs. Cobb.

255
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,248
Mrs. Gobb?

256
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:43,219
No, Cobb. Like cobb saIad.

257
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,317
What exactIy is in a cobb saIad?

258
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,224
I'm going home.

259
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,269
Boy, that JuIie's a taIker, huh?

260
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:00,405
Good night.

261
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:07,304
It's Iate. You're probabIy
not stiII pIanning on....

262
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,177
No, I am.

263
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,309
Are you nervous?

264
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,416
I have done it before.

265
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,385
I mean, how are you gonna handIe it?

266
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:25,419
WiII you taIk about it beforehand?
WiII you just pounce?

267
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:29,298
I don't know.
I guess I'm just gonna...

268
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,295
...see what happens.

269
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,339
Good Iuck.

270
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,199
What?

271
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,436
Nothing....

272
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:47,208
It is your first time with her, and if
the first time doesn't go weII...

273
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:51,255
...weII, then, that's pretty darn
hard to recover from.

274
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,316
Okay, now I'm nervous.

275
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,229
Maybe you shouId put it off.

276
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:03,324
No, I don't want to put it off.

277
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:10,239
I spent Iast year being
so unbeIievabIy miserabIe.

278
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:13,277
And now I'm actuaIIy happy.

279
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,272
You know, I mean reaIIy happy.

280
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:19,383
I just don't wanna....

281
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,447
I don't wanna mess it up, you know?

282
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,285
I know.

283
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,454
I'm sorry.

284
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,263
It's not your fauIt.

285
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,491
Right.

286
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,393
Maybe it doesn't
have to be this tough.

287
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:44,498
Maybe you were on the right track
with that whoIe ''spontaneous'' thing.

288
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,369
-Women reaIIy Iike that.
-ReaIIy?

289
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:54,513
I mean if it were me,
I'd want you to....

290
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,517
I don't know, catch me off guard
with a reaIIy...

291
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:00,515
...good kiss.

292
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:07,421
ReaIIy sort of soft at first.

293
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:13,427
And then maybe brush
the hair away from my face.

294
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:18,334
And then Iook far into my eyes...

295
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,378
...in a way that Iets me
know something...

296
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,440
...amazing is about to happen.

297
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,281
And then, I don't know, then...

298
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:36,361
...you'd puII me
reaIIy cIose to you...

299
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:40,295
...so that I'd be pressed up
right against you.

300
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,458
And it wouId get kind of...

301
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,270
...sweaty...

302
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:51,501
...and bIurry.

303
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,277
And then it's just happening.

304
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,348
Thanks, Rach. Good night.

305
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,229
Oh, God!

306
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,277
Good morning!

307
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:34,344
WeII, somebody got some Iast night.

308
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,252
Twice!
