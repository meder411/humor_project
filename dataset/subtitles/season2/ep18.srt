00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:05,430
<i>It's not fair! It's my money.</i>

2
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:08,373
<i>I know. But it's what Brad wanted.</i>

3
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:11,274
-Which one is she?
-That's Brad's widow.

4
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:14,438
-Why is she so upset?
-She was cut out of the wiII.

5
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:18,342
Doesn't she know you can't
define yourseIf by money?

6
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:23,550
It's about vaIues and moraIs and
your abiIity to give and receive Iove.

7
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,450
No.

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,351
<i>-Oh, Drake.</i>
<i>-I'm sorry, Amber.</i>

9
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:32,456
<i>It's just like Brad to have</i>
<i>to have the last word.</i>

10
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:36,265
-Sorry I'm Iate. What happened?
-We wanna see the end.

11
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,270
<i>-I want you, Drake.</i>
<i>-I know you do.</i>

12
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,499
<i>But we can never</i>
<i>be together that way.</i>

13
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,264
<i>What?</i>

14
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:48,370
<i>There's something I never told you.</i>
<i>I'm actually your half-brother.</i>

15
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,317
So, what happens next?

16
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:58,516
I get a medicaI award
for separating Siamese twins.

17
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:04,262
Then Amber and I go to VenezueIa to
meet our other haIf-brother, Ramon...

18
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:08,323
...where I find the worId's
biggest emeraId. It's reaIIy big.

19
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,369
But it's cursed.

20
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,233
So cooI!

21
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:15,273
God, that is good TV!

22
00:01:16,342 --> 00:01:18,367
The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies

23
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:08,460
-Come on, Pheebs. PIay with me!
-No! This game is grotesque!

24
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,222
Twenty armIess guys joined
at the waist by a steeI bar...

25
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:16,360
...forced to pIay soccer forever?

26
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,461
HeIIo? Human rights vioIation!

27
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,464
Don't feeI bad. After pIaying...

28
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:26,372
...I break out the pIastic women
and everybody has a good time.

29
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,440
Why don't you pIay with your roommate?

30
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,342
He's not a big fan of foosbaII.

31
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:36,354
Are we not getting aIong
with the new boy?

32
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:40,392
No, he's aII right. He spends
most of his time in his room.

33
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:45,261
Because you haven't gotten
to know him. Let's remedy that.

34
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:48,563
-We don't need to remedy that.
-Yeah, it'II be fun!

35
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,470
What was that?

36
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:57,369
Hi! I just thought it'd be fun if we
had beers and got to know each other.

37
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,411
-AII right.
-Oh, good! Okay.

38
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:05,315
Oh, no! I have to go
because I'm Iate for my...

39
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:08,410
...<i>Green Eggs and Ham</i>
discussion group.

40
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:12,447
Tonight, it's, ''Why he wouId not
eat them on a train.''

41
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,319
-Have fun! Bye!
-That was so Iame.

42
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,352
I know.

43
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,261
Okay, taIk to him.

44
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:28,264
So you think that <i>Speed Racer</i> guy
gets a Iot of tickets or...?

45
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,371
That's good.
Who broke up with who?

46
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:39,476
I broke up with her. She thought Sean
Penn was the capitaI of Cambodia.

47
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:45,350
That's good! When everybody knows
the capitaI of Cambodia is....

48
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,552
WeII, it's not Sean Penn.

49
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,353
AII right, I got a funny one.

50
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:56,266
My Iast girIfriend, TiIIy, we're
eating breakfast. I made 50 pancakes.

51
00:03:56,302 --> 00:04:01,205
AII of a sudden, she turns to me and
says, ''I don't wanna see you anymore.''

52
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:05,437
It was Iike she had reached
into my chest, ripped out my heart...

53
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:09,443
...and smeared it aII over my Iife!

54
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:13,310
There was this incredibIe abyss
and I'm faIIing...

55
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,322
...and I don't think
I'm ever gonna stop!

56
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,253
That wasn't such
a funny story, was it?

57
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,327
<i>A crusty old man</i>
<i>Said I'll do what I can</i>

58
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,431
<i>And the rest of the rats</i>
<i>Played maracas</i>

59
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,534
That's it! Thanks! Good night.

60
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,380
Phoebe's got another job, right?

61
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,275
-Great set tonight, Pheebs.
-I know.

62
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,379
We shouId get going.

63
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:52,254
We shouId go too.
I got patients in the morning.

64
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:55,293
You know how we aIways
stay at your pIace?

65
00:04:55,361 --> 00:05:00,424
-I thought we'd stay at my pIace.
-I don't know. I don't have my jammies.

66
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,394
You don't need them.

67
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,404
My baby sister, Iadies and gentIemen.

68
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,434
Shut up. I'm happy.

69
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,336
Oh, this is so nice!
I have to make a speech.

70
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:19,443
I want to say, of aII the guys Monica
has been with, and that is a Iot...

71
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,415
...I Iike you the best.

72
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,425
Thank you, Pheebs.
That's very sweet.

73
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,318
You hear that?

74
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:33,424
She Iikes me best. And apparentIy,
there have been a Iot.

75
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:37,425
Not a Iot. Phoebe's kidding.
Phoebe's crazy.

76
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,432
Phoebe's dead.

77
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,474
I'm Iooking for Eddie Manoick.

78
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,550
He's not here now. I'm ChandIer.
Can I take a message or a fish-tank?

79
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:59,349
-Thanks.
-Come on in.

80
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,383
I'm TiIIy.

81
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:09,400
I gather by that ''Oh,''
he toId you about me.

82
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:12,403
Yeah, your name came up...

83
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:16,441
...in a conversation that
terrified me to my very souI.

84
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,310
He's kind of intense.

85
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:22,314
Yes! Can I ask you,
is Eddie a IittIe--?

86
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,317
-A IittIe what?
-Bit country?

87
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:32,450

88
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,351
Come on in here, you roomie!

89
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,259
HeIIo, TiIIy.

90
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,457
I just came by to drop off your tank.

91
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:44,226
That was very thoughtfuI of you.
It's very thoughtfuI.

92
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,468
WeII, okay then.

93
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:54,540
-I'm gonna go. Bye.
-Bye!

94
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,444

95
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:01,317

101
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,399
Oh, I Iook good.

102
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:29,313
Is this true? That you write
a Iot of your Iines?

103
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,314
WeII, kind of, yeah.

104
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:35,444
Remember Iast week
when AIex was in the accident?

105
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:41,319
The script said, ''If we don't get this
woman to a hospitaI she'II die.''

106
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:46,421
But I made it, ''If this woman doesn't
get to a hospitaI she won't Iive.''

107
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,462
Oh, okay.
I see what you did there.

108
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,472
Aren't you afraid the writers
wiII be mad when they read this?

109
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:05,313
I never thought about the writers.
The scripts just come to my house.

110
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,378
But you know what?

111
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:13,391
This makes me Iook good, which makes
the show and the writers Iook good.

112
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,286
How couId they be mad?

113
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:22,197

<i>Son of a....</i>

What the heII does this mean?

116
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,303
I don't know.
I just bring the scripts.

117

Right. CouId you sign this?

119
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,249
No! No way! I'm not signing that!

120
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:51,422
I don't think that's gonna affect
the pIot of the show.

121
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,228
How can they do this to me?

122
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,500
I'm just gonna go.

123
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,400
Sorry.

124
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,306
WeII, it wasn't that many guys.

125
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,374
If you consider
how many guys there are...

126
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:15,285
...it's a very smaII percentage.

127
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,289
It's not a big a deaI.
I was just curious.

128
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,291
-Good night.
-Good night.

129
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,294
Good Iuck, Mon.

130
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:26,422
Before I teII you, you teII me
how many women you've been with.

131
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,425
Two.

132
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,238
Two? Two?

133
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:38,207
How is that possibIe?
I mean, have you seen you?

134
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,304
WeII, what can I say?

135
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:46,215
I was married to Barbara for 30 years,
my high schooI sweetheart.

136
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,220
Now you. That's two.

137
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,445
Two it is.

138
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,316
Time for bed.
I'm gonna brush my teeth.

139
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:58,261
No, wait a minute now!
Come on, it's your turn.

140
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,332
Oh, come on!

141
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:06,361
You know, I don't need the
actuaI number. Just a baIIpark.

142
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,441
Okay, it is definiteIy
Iess than a baIIpark.

143
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,247
I am so gIad
I'm not Monica right now.

144
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,544
TeII me about it.

145
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,277
So what's your magic number?

146
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:29,258
Come on, you know everyone
I've been with. AII both of them.

147
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,488
WeII, there's you.

148
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,300
Better not be doing these in order.

149
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:41,499
BiIIy Dreskin, Pete Carny,
Barry and...

150
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,400
...oh, PaoIo.

151
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,378
Oh, yes, the weenie from Turinie.

152
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,315
Honey, are you jeaIous of PaoIo?

153
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:56,286
I'm so much happier with you
than I ever was with him.

154
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,380
-ReaIIy?
-Oh, pIease!

155
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,358
That PaoIo thing was
bareIy a reIationship.

156
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:05,363
AII it reaIIy was just
meaningIess, animaI sex.

157
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:14,532
Okay, you know, that sounded
so much better in my head.

158
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,434
Eddie, I didn't sIeep with her!

159
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:21,338
That's what someone
who sIept with her wouId say.

160
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,349
This is nuts!
She was over for two minutes...

161
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,248
...dropped off a fish tank and Ieft!

162
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:29,447
-Where's Buddy?
-Buddy?

163
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,388
My fish, Buddy.

164
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,350
There was no fish
when she dropped it off.

165
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:39,387
This is unbeIievabIe! First you sIeep
with my ex-girIfriend...

166
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:43,401
...insuIt me by Iying,
then you kiII my fish, my Buddy?

167
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:47,462
I didn't kiII your fish!
Look, Eddie--

168
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:56,475
WouId you Iook at what I'm doing here?
Now that can't be smart.

169
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:04,420
So we're gonna take this guy right off
you and put him here in Mr. Pocket.

170
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,223
TangeIo?

171
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,330
That's it? That's the number
you were afraid to say?

172
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:23,340
-WeII, yeah.
-That's not bad at aII.

173
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:27,334
You had me thinking
it was, Iike, a fIeet.

174
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:32,281
-You're reaIIy okay with it?
-Oh, honey, I'm fine.

175
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,378
Okay, about that two.

176
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:42,291
What?
AII right, what about my two?

177
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:45,262
It just seems Iike
a reaIIy smaII number.

178
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,561
Right. And...?

179
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,396
And, weII, don't you have
a Iot of wiId oats to sow?

180
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:57,306
Or is that what you're doing with me?
Oh, my God! Am I an oat?

181
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,467
Honey, you are not an oat.

182
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:03,414
I don't know, I guess
I'm just not an oat guy.

183
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:09,354
-I've onIy sIept with women I Iove.
-But you've onIy sIept with two peopIe.

184
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,248
Right.

185
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:25,237
You know I Iove you too, right?

186
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,364
Now I do.

187
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:34,537
Ross! Ross, pIease Iisten to me!
Ross!

188
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,375
You are so much better
for me than PaoIo ever was!

189
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:42,250
You care for me, you're Ioving,
you make me Iaugh.

190
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:47,248
If I make you Iaugh, here's an idea.
Invite PaoIo for a romp in the sack...

191
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:51,489
...and I'II stand in the corner
and teII knock-knock jokes!

192
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,296
What we have is speciaI!

193
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:59,497
-AII PaoIo and I had was--
-AnimaI sex? AnimaI sex?

194
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:06,300
So, what are you saying? There's
nothing between us ''animaI'' at aII?

195
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:12,317
There's not even, Iike,
a IittIe animaI? Not even, Iike...

196
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:15,218
...chipmunk sex?

197
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:20,358
Try to hear me, okay?

198
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:25,227
I'm not gonna Iie to you.
It was good with PaoIo.

199
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:28,425
-Knock-knock.
-But!

200
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,469
What you and I have
is so much better.

201
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:36,367
We have tenderness,
we have intimacy, we connect.

202
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,273
You know? I swear...

203
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:43,475
...this is the best I have ever had.

204
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,242
UntiI now.

205
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,293
-Richard said he Ioved me.
-Oh, my God!

206
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:00,298
-I know!
-Honey, that's great!

207
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,334
-I can't find--
-Top drawer. Hurry.

208
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:07,304
-Why? You need one too?
-Oh, yeah.

209
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,397
Found them!

210
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,209
There's onIy one.

211
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:22,415
We'II be right there.
We're trying to decide something.

212
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:44,232
-They're trying to decide something.
-Good. Good, good.

213
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:53,544
So was your mustache,
did it used to be different?

214
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,481
No.

215
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:04,390
How do you, you know,
keep it so neat?

216
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,325
I have a IittIe comb.

217
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:15,305
-And what do you caII that?
-A mustache comb.

218
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:20,403
Okay, I wiII do your Iaundry
for one month.

219
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,309
No!

220
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:27,317
I wiII, I wiII.... I wiII cIean
the apartment for two months.

221
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:33,221
I'II give this to you now, if you
teII me where we keep the dustpan.

222
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,333
So were you in Nam?

223
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:54,276
We are both aduIts here. Right? There
has to be a mature way to handIe this.

224
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,247
-Rock, paper, scissors?
-Gotcha.

225
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,249
One, two, three.

226
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,285
Yes!

227
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:06,248
-Fine. Go have sex.
-Thank you.

228
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:11,420
No! You have got it compIeteIy wrong!
John Savage was <i>Deer Hunter,</i> no Iegs.

229
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,291
Jon Voight was <i>Coming Home,</i>
couIdn't feeI his Iegs.

230
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:19,394
You've got it the other way
around, my friend. Jon Voight--

231
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,230
-Honey?
-What?

232
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:32,442
-ShaII we?
-It's not gonna happen.

233
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:37,314
They're doing it tonight.
We can do it tomorrow.

234
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:43,224
In the future, if I couId see
the scheduIe beforehand....

235
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:51,359
When I woke up this morning, he'd
stoIen aII the insoIes out of my shoes!

236
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,461
Why?

237
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:57,231
He thinks I sIept with his
ex-girIfriend and kiIIed his fish.

238
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,471
Why wouId you kiII his fish?

239
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:08,186
Because sometimes, after you sIeep
with someone, you have to kiII a fish.

240
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,323
ChandIer, honey, I'm sorry.

241
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:17,192
-Can we watch Joey's show now, pIease?
-Wait. He's not here yet.

242
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:20,322
So? He's on the show.
He knows what happens.

243
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:24,300
I'm fine about my probIem now,
by the way.

244
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:27,396
Amber...

245
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,200
...I'II aIways be there for you,
as a friend and as your brother.

246
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,243
Oh, Drake.

247
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:39,343
-Hard day, huh?
-First the medicaI award, now this?

248
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,410
Yeah. Some guys are
just Iucky, I guess.

249
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:48,319
<i>Dr. Ramoray, report to</i>
<i>first floor Emergency stat.</i>

250
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:53,321
WeII, then, I guess that's me.

251
00:18:55,467 --> 00:19:00,200
Anyone eIse need to go on
the eIevator? Dr. Horton? Dr. WaII?

252
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,297
They onIy said you.

253
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,277
Oh, okay. AII right.

254
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,177
-I Iove you, Drake.
-Yeah, whatever.

255
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,305
Oh, no!

256
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,181
Drake, Iook out!

257
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,188
-Did they just kiII off Joey?
-No!

258
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,387
Now maybe.

259
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:29,390
Come on! Open up!
We want to taIk to you!

260
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:33,296
-I don't feeI Iike taIking!
-We care about you.

261
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:38,240
-We're worried about you.
-And some of us reaIIy have to pee!

262
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,205
I'm sorry, Joey.

263
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:49,251
Listen, sorry about your death.
That reaIIy sucks.

264
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:53,254
-We came when we saw.
-Why didn't you teII us?

265
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:58,319
I don't know. I was kind of hoping
no one wouId find out.

266
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:02,231
WeII, maybe they couId find
a way to bring you back.

267
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:07,235
They said when they found my body,
my brain was so smashed in...

268
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:11,241
...that the onIy doctor who
couId have saved me was me.

269
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:15,470
It's supposed to be
some kind of irony.

270
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:22,283
You're gonna be fine. You don't need
that show. It was a dumb soap opera.

271
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:25,380
It was the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

272
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:29,393
Yes! I was going to incorporate that.

273
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:33,261
Here's Monica.
She'II say something nice.

274
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:39,301
I straightened out your shower curtain
so you won't get miIdew.

275
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:42,363
What? To me, that's nice.

276
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:47,502
-It'II be okay. You know that.
-No, I don't.

277
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,374
It's Iike you work
your whoIe Iife for something...

278
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:56,386
...and you think when you get it,
it'II never be as good as you thought.

279
00:20:56,421 --> 00:21:00,255
But this so was.
It changed everything.

280
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,419
The other day, I got
a credit card appIication...

281
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:06,258
...and I was pre-approved!

282
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:12,233
I've never been pre-approved
for anything in my Iife!

283
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:13,463
I'm sorry, man.

284
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:17,333
I don't know if this'II mean
anything to you...

285
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:21,344
...but you'II aIways be
pre-approved with us.

286
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,372
No, that means nothing to me.

287
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:33,347
Pecan sandy? Just made them.

288
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:35,492
Yeah, aII right.

289
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:40,288
-What are these, raisins?
-Sure, why not?

290
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,406
Listen, Eddie.

291
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:55,312
I've been thinking about our Iiving
situation. Why are you smiIing?

292
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,382
I got a IittIe surprise.
Look. There's a new fishy.

293
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:03,411
I named him ChandIer,
you know, after you.

294
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:16,230
WeII, that's not even a reaI fish.

295
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:20,234
No, that's a GoIdfish cracker.

296
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,332
So what's your point, man?

297
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,440
Okay, good night.

298
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:32,348
You big freak of nature!

299
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,445
-Brisk tonight.
-Oh, man.

300
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,206
-Let's never speak of this.
-You got it.
