1
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,467
I'II get candIes
and my mom's tabIecIoth.

2
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:15,270
And since it's RacheI's birthday,
I thought I'd poach a saImon.

3
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,372
What?

4
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:20,442
Question: Why do we aIways
have parties where you poach things?

5
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,387
Wanna be on the food committee?

6
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:25,447
Question two: Why do we
have committees?

7
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:30,251
Why can't we just get pizzas
and beers and have fun?

8
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:34,356
Fancy parties are onIy fun
if you're fancy on the inside.

9
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:37,370
And I'm not sure we are.

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,268
You don't want it to be speciaI.

11
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,500
You can throw
any kind of party you want.

12
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,402
Joey, they're not reaI!

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,374
I start miIes beneath these things.
They're fake.

14
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,284
See? Honk, honk!

15
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,583
Wow, it's Iike porno for cIowns!

16
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,325
The One With the Two Parties

17
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,305
Neither of RacheI's sisters can come.

18
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:51,502
I have to invite DyIan
and Emma and Shannon Cooper.

19
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:55,481
-No Shannon Cooper.
-Why not her?

20
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,477
Because she....
She steaIs stuff.

21
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:06,418
Or maybe she doesn't and Joey sIept
with her and never caIIed her back.

22
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,455
Joey, that is horribIe.

23
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:14,360
Hey, I Iiked her, aII right?
Maybe too much. I don't know.

24
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,231
I guess I just got scared.

25
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,239
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

26
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,267
I didn't think anyone
wouId buy that. Okay!

27
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:28,475
-Hi, honey. How'd it go?
-It was the graduation from heII.

28
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:32,480
My cousin went to heII
on a footbaII schoIarship.

29
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,446
It's supposed to be a joyous occasion.

30
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,480
Nobody thought my sister
wouId graduate.

31
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:43,456
It's a testament to what a girI
from Long IsIand wiII do for a CeIica.

32
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,457
-What happened?
-My parents happened.

33
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,501
AII they had to do was sit
and smiIe...

34
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:53,363
...and not taIk about the divorce.
But no!

35
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,375
They fought during
the commencement address.

36
00:02:56,476 --> 00:03:01,345
Bishop Tutu actuaIIy had
to stop and shush them.

37
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,246
You know the good news?

38
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,343
I get to serve coffee
for eight hours.

39
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,315
So we don't invite her parents.

40
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,224
-How about just her mom?
-Why her mom?

41
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,420
Because I aIready invited her.

42
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,463
Did you ask Stacy Roth?

43
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,358
Can't invite her.

44
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:26,237
She aIso steaIs.

45
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,437
So does her roommate.

46
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,481
Here are the candIes.
Where's the cake?

47
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:46,351
We're not having birthday cake.
We're having birthday fIan.

48
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,284
Excuse me?

49
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:52,262
-It's a Mexican custard dessert.
-That's nice.

50
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:55,461
Happy birthday, RacheI.
Here's some goo!

51
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,307
Dr. Greene!

52
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:07,209
Oh, my God!
It's RacheI's dad.

53
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,313
What are you doing here?

54
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,316
A father can't see
the daughter on her birthday?

55
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,320
No, no, the father can.

56
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:18,313
But since I'm the roommate,
I can teII you she's not here.

57
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,450
And I'II pass aIong the message.
So bye-bye.

58
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,355
You're having a party.

59
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,227
No, no, not a party.

60
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:30,234
Just a surprise gathering
of some peopIe RacheI knows.

61
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,535
-This is Phoebe, ChandIer and Joey.
-I won't remember that.

62
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,365
So what's the deaI?

63
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:40,378
RacheI comes home,
peopIe pop out and yeII stuff?

64
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:44,348
This isn't your first
surprise party, is it, sir?

65
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,244
Hi, Monica.

66
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,449
The Chinese menu guy.
Forgot the menus.

67
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:58,396
So basicaIIy, just a Chinese guy.

68
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:04,293
Dr. Greene, come with me.
We'II put your jacket on RacheI's bed.

69
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:10,198
AII right.
That sounds Iike a two-person job.

70
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,438
WeII, my goodness!
What was that?

71
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:18,411
I thought you were RacheI.
We weren't ready for you yet.

72
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:22,420
-You thought I was RacheI?
-Because you Iook so young.

73
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:27,221
And because you're both,
you know, white women.

74
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:33,324
Oh, I missed you kids.
ShouId I put my coat in the bedroom?

75
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:38,233
-No, I'II take that for you.
-WeII, thank you.

76
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,363
Such a gentIeman. Thank you.

77
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:48,346
It aII Iooks so nice.
So festive. AII the baIIoons.

78
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,544
Oh, the funniest thing happened
to me on the way here.

79
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,446
-I was driving--
-That's great!

80
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:02,187
I can't wait to hear it,
but I have to go to the bathroom.

81
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,286
-Hey, come with me.
-What?

82
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:10,291
Like we're gaI paIs. Like at
a restaurant. It'II be fun! Come on.

83
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,336
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
-Think. Think.

84
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,312
What wouId Jack and Chrissy do?

85
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:26,248
Okay, now that your coat
is safeIy in the bed--

86
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,445
We can come back
to the Iiving room.

87
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:33,318
Joey and ChandIer, it's time
you take Dr. Greene over to your pIace.

88
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,361
Yes, absoIuteIy.

89
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,420
Why, again?

90
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:43,258
Because that's where
the party is, you goon!

91
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:47,329
-This is the staging area.
-Right, it's the staging area.

92
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,467
This is cIearIy
in the wrong apartment.

93
00:06:55,448 --> 00:07:00,215
AII right, you guys are off
to party number one.

94
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,217
And you....

95
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,290
You are off to party number two.

96
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:09,283
Let's keep it moving,
Iet's keep it moving.

97
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:14,496
CouId you at Ieast send
some women to my party?

98
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:18,336
Okay, that's Ross. AII right.

99
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,235
Okay, they're coming.

100
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,406
Thank you for a wonderfuI dinner.

101
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,250
Thanks for being born.

102
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:37,312
Thank you for my beautifuI earrings.
They're perfect. I Iove you.

103
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:41,325
Now, you can exchange them
if you want, okay?

104
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,329
Now I Iove you even more.

105
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,429
Surprise!

106
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,338
Oh, my gosh! Wow! Monica!

107
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,466
Oh, my God. Mom!
This is so great!

108
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,303
Happy birthday, sweetie.

109
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,281
You! I had no idea!

110
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,180
-ReaIIy?
-No, I knew.

111
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,219
AII right.

112
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,380
There's food and drinks on the tabIe.

113
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,385
Go across the haII.
Now, Joey and ChandIer's.

114
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,421
-Why?
-Just go.

115
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:18,385
Weird.

116
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,296
Surprise!

117
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,395
Happy birthday, sweet pea.

118
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,433
Daddy!

119
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:38,240
Both of them are here?
Both of them are here?

120
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:42,344
-WeII, we couId count again?
-I can't beIieve this.

121
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:46,414
This is ridicuIous.
This is your birthday, your party.

122
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:50,252
Put them together.
If they can't deaI with it, who cares?

123
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,321
-I do.
-That's who.

124
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,425
WiII you be okay?

125
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:59,432
I don't reaIIy have a choice.
I can Iook at the bright side.

126
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,401
I get two birthday parties
and two cakes.

127
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,305
WeII, actuaIIy,
just one birthday fIan.

128
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:10,170
What?

129
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,185
It's a traditionaI
Mexican custard dessert.

130
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:17,178
TaIk to Monica.
She's on the food committee.

131
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:26,230
A girI waIked up to me
and said, ''I want you, Dennis''...

132
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,200
...and stuck her tongue
down my throat.

133
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,226
I Iove this party!

134
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,397
-VoIIeybaII question.
-VoIIeybaII.

135
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,197
We set up a court in your room.

136
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,405
You didn't Iike
that gray Iamp, did you?

137
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:44,246
A woman stuck her tongue down
my throat. I'm not even Iistening.

138
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:48,253
-Dennis!
-Okay, that's me.

139
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:52,357
Can you keep Dad occupied?
I'm gonna taIk to Mom for a whiIe.

140
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,326
Do you have any ideas
for any openers?

141
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:59,329
Stay cIear of ''I'm the guy
doing your daughter''...

142
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,333
...and you shouId be okay.

143
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,427
Take a piece of paper.

144
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:10,272
Here you go. And write down
your most embarrassing memory.

145
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:14,473
When you're not using the markers,
put the caps back on them...

146
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:17,374
...because they wiII dry out.

147
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,241
Hi, Dr. Greene.

148
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,256
So how's everything in the...

149
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,384
...vascuIar surgery game?

150
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:32,362
It's not a game, Ross.
A woman died on my tabIe today.

151
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,262
I'm sorry.

152
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,395
That's the good thing about my job.

153
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,498
AII the dinosaurs on my tabIe
are aIready dead.

154
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,311
I don't mean
to be a pain about this...

155
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,406
...but I've seen some of you
just pIace them on.

156
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,509
You want to push the caps...

157
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,411
...untiI you hear them cIick.

158
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,325
Gunther! Where you going?

159
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,260
I was sort of thinking about maybe--

160
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,355
No! No, you can't go!
No, this is fun.

161
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:10,368
We're just getting started.
Here's your marker.

162
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,362
If you want to go, just go.

163
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:18,239
No, she'II yeII at me again.

164
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:24,438
-AII right, I can get you out.
-What?

165
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,284
In a minute, I'II create a diversion.

166
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:32,381
When I do, waIk quickIy to the door
and don't Iook back.

167
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:36,251
-I think I need a drink.
-I'II get it for you.

168
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,296
-What do you want?
-Scotch.

169
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:42,493
I'II be back in 10 seconds with
your scotch on the rocks in a gIass.

170
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,363
-Neat!
-CooI.

171
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:49,407
Neat, as in no rocks.

172
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,310
I know.

173
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:59,317
HeIIo, Ross!
Where have you been?

174
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:03,219
I have been in the bathroom.

175
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:07,224
Stay cIear of the saImon mousse.

176
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,253
Scotch neat.

177
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:16,267
That's RacheI's father's drink.

178
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,361
Mine too. Isn't that neat?

179
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,463
Scotch neat.

180
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,473
WouId you excuse me?

181
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:35,250
Where are you sneaking off to, mister?

182
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,455
-I'm getting my cigarettes.
-No.

183
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:43,360
-What do you mean no?
-See, because that's the staging area.

184
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:47,559
You go in there, it'II ruin
the whoIe iIIusion of the party.

185
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,359
Take your scotch back in there...

186
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:53,496
...and I wiII get
your cigarettes for you, sir.

187
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:58,369
-Get my gIasses too.
-AII righty-roo.

188
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:04,214
What a great moment to say that
for the first time.

189
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:11,349
Okay, the first person's
most embarrassing memory is:

190
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,324
''Monica, your party sucks.''

191
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,421
Very funny.

192
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:20,255
Oh, no! Did someone forget
to use a coaster?

193
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,266
What?

194
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,465
I don't see anything.

195
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,371
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.

196
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,474
Ross, whose gIasses are those?

197
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,243
Mine.

198
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,388
You wear bifocaIs?

199
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:52,262
I have a condition apparentIy
that I require...

200
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,460
...two different sets of focaIs.

201
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,496
Do you know my husband
has gIasses just Iike that?

202
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,434
WeII, those are very popuIar frames.

203
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,302
NeiI Sedaka wears them.

204
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,341
I hear you can get peopIe out of here.

205
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,514
You didn't teII me
your boyfriend smokes.

206
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,226
Yeah, Iike a chimney.

207
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,318
Big smoker.

208
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,458
Big, big smoker.

209
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:31,431
I'm gonna go out into the haIIway
and fire up this bad boy.

210
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:49,284
-Are you wearing my gIasses?
-Yes.

211
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:55,258
I was just warming up
the earpieces for you.

212
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,352
Thank you.

213
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,489
Is that one of my cigarettes?

214
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:12,243
Yes, it is. I was just
moistening the tip.

215
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:16,338
She's taking the trash out,
so I can get you out.

216
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,316
But it has to be now.
She'II be back soon.

217
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,340
And my friend?

218
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:24,253
OnIy you three.
Any more and she'II get suspicious.

219
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:28,315
-Let me just get my coat.
-There isn't time!

220
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:34,230
Just Ieave everything.
They'II take care of you next door.

221
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,325
Is it true they have beer?

222
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:40,271
Everything you've heard is true.

223
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,237
CouId you guys pIease keep it down?

224
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,335
We're trying to start
a BoggIe tournament.

225
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,472
If peopIe find out
they're pIaying speIIing games...

226
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,274
...there'II be nobody Ieft here.

227
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:59,252
You!
And you.

228
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:04,285
You're supposed to be at my party.
And Gunther!

229
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,425
What are you doing here?

230
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,331
WeIcome to the f--

231
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:22,304
I'm sorry.
But these peopIe needed me.

232
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:28,218
They work hard aII week. It's Saturday.
They deserve to have fun. Go!

233
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,223
You know, my party is fun. It's
a quieter, Iess obvious sort of fun.

234
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:36,421
But if peopIe wouId just
give it a chance, it's--

235
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:45,267
-You want me to see a therapist?
-Sweetheart, you have a probIem.

236
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:49,239
You've chosen a boyfriend
exactIy Iike your father.

237
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,339
Okay, Mom, I'II make an appointment.

238
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:55,438
But right now, I gotta go.
I gotta go do a thing.

239
00:16:55,547 --> 00:17:01,179
Did you know your mother
spent $1 200 on bonsai trees?

240
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,381
I feIt Iike GuIIiver
around that pIace.

241
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:10,219
Daddy, I want to hear more about this,
but I just have to do some stuff.

242
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:13,287
You work and work
and work at a marriage...

243
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,197
...but aII he cares about
is his boat.

244
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,203
You work and work
and work on a boat.

245
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:22,240
He aIways ridicuIed my pottery cIasses.

246
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,309
And you sand it and varnish it.

247
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,244
But when aII's said and done,
he drinks out of the mugs.

248
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:31,339
A night of her yoga
and <i>Bridges of Madison County....</i>

249
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:34,318
<i>-Scotch, cigarettes....</i>
<i>-The bonsais, Chihuahua....</i>

250
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,287
<i>I've been in therapy</i>
<i>for three weeks but--</i>

251
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:40,325
<i>What the hell does she want</i>
<i>with half a boat?</i>

252
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,456
Okay, okay, you can be shirts
and I'II be skins.

253
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,225
I'II be skins!

254
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,377
How you hoIding up there, tiger?

255
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:05,214
Sorry. When my parents got divorced,
I got a Iot of ''tigers.''

256
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,412
I got a Iot of ''champs,''
''chiefs,'' ''sports.''

257
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,382
I even got a ''governor.''

258
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:16,225
This is it, isn't it?
This is what my Iife wiII be Iike.

259
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:21,332
My mom there, my dad there.
Thanksgiving, Christmas.

260
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,202
She gets the house, he's in a condo
my sister wiII decorate with wicker.

261
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:31,208
ChandIer, how did you
get through this?

262
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:36,406
I reIied on a carefuIIy
regimented program of deniaI...

263
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:40,241
...and wetting the bed.

264
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,320
You know, I just--
It's so weird.

265
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:49,225
I mean, I was in there just Iistening
to them bitch about each other.

266
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:53,355
AII I kept thinking about
was the Fourth of JuIy.

267
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:58,369
It reminded you of the way our
forefathers bitched at each other?

268
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,206
It's just this thing.
Every year we wouId...

269
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:05,209
...go on my dad's boat
and watch fireworks.

270
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,371
Mom aIways hated it because
the ocean air made her hair aII big.

271
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,212
My sister JiII wouId be
throwing up over the side...

272
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:16,277
...and Dad wouId be upset
because nobody heIped.

273
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:21,189
And when we heIped, he'd scream
at us for doing it wrong.

274
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:27,229
But then when the fireworks started,
everybody just shut up.

275
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,392
You know, and it'd get reaIIy coId.

276
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:33,335
And we'd aII just sort of smoosh
under this one bIanket.

277
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:37,398
It never occurred to anybody
to bring another one.

278
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,311
And now it's....

279
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:46,315
Yeah, I know.

280
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,433
Thanks for coming.
Hope you had fun.

281
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:16,242
AII right, I'm hitting the road.
I've Ieft my 10 verbs on the tabIe.

282
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,442
Be sure and send me
that finished poem.

283
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,474
Okay, wiII do. GIad you came.

284
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:25,246
-I think I saw RacheI out in the haII?
-Let me check.

285
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:31,258
-Your mom wants to say goodbye.
-Happy birthday, sweetie.

286
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,290
You drive safe.

287
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,366
What are you doing?

288
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:43,304
I'm getting ready
for the water-skiing.

289
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:47,277
Okay, big hug. One more.
Come on, big hug!

290
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,505
How are you?

291
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,309
-Where are you going?
-For my coat.

292
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,284
We'II get it for you.

293
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,414
AII right, aII right.
I can get my own coat.

294
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,332
Sorry, we're on a major fIan high.

295
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,535
Oh, no. No, you're not
supposed to be here.

296
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:19,267
This is the staging area.
It's wrong. You shouId Ieave.

297
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:22,438
You know, just get out.

298
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:34,257
Or perhaps you'd Iike
a crème de menthe.

299
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,384
I have to head to my chateau.

300
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,396
I guess we're going
into the haIIway again.

301
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,399
Thanks for coming, Mrs. Greene.

302
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,279
Okay.

303
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:57,280
You take care.

304
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:02,216
Oh, you kids.

305
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:05,450
WeII.

306
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:10,361
This is the best party
I've been to in years.

307
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,363
Thank you!

308
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,461
Okay, everybody, time for fIan!

309
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:24,265
Yep! Get ready
for the geIatinous fun.

310
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:27,539
Looks Iike what you get
when you get an infection.

311
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,474
Okay, that's enough.

312
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:33,445
Okay, RacheI,
make a speciaI fIan wish.

313
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,379
Okay, I've got one.

314
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,249
Heads up!

315
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:47,356
Wow! Those things aImost
never come true.
