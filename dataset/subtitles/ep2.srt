391
00:29:41,191 --> 00:29:42,317
You don't understand.

392
00:29:43,093 --> 00:29:46,085
For us, kissing is as
important as any part.

393
00:29:46,196 --> 00:29:47,288
Yeah, right!

394
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,292
You serious?

395
00:29:52,302 --> 00:29:53,234
Oh, yeah.

396
00:29:53,337 --> 00:29:57,137
-Everything is in that first kiss.
-AbsoIuteIy.

397
00:29:57,241 --> 00:30:00,108
For us, kissing's an opening act...

398
00:30:00,143 --> 00:30:03,203
...Iike the comedian
you have to sit through...

399
00:30:03,247 --> 00:30:05,238
...before Pink FIoyd comes out.

400
00:30:08,352 --> 00:30:12,118
And it's not that
we don't Iike the comedian.

401
00:30:12,222 --> 00:30:17,216
It's just that that's not
why we bought the ticket.

402
00:30:19,229 --> 00:30:23,256
The probIem is, no matter
how great the show was...

403
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:27,167
...you girIs are Iooking
for the comedian again.

404
00:30:27,271 --> 00:30:32,231
We're in the car, fighting traffic,
just trying to stay awake.

405
00:30:34,244 --> 00:30:37,179
Word of advice:
Bring back the comedian.

406
00:30:37,281 --> 00:30:42,116
Or next time you'II find yourseIf
Iistening to that aIbum aIone.

407
00:30:46,323 --> 00:30:49,190
Are we stiII taIking about sex?

408
00:30:50,294 --> 00:30:52,285
The One With the Sonogram at the End

409
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,278
No, it's good. It is good.

410
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,208
It's just that-- Doesn't she seem
a IittIe angry?

411
00:31:46,316 --> 00:31:48,079
WeII, she has issues.

412
00:31:50,087 --> 00:31:51,076
Does she?

413
00:31:51,188 --> 00:31:53,281
Try to Iive with ''Mr. I'm EvoIving.''

414
00:31:55,092 --> 00:32:01,088
He's out whiIe she's home getting
the mastodon smeII out of the carpet.

415
00:32:01,231 --> 00:32:04,291
Marsha, see, these are cave peopIe.

416
00:32:05,302 --> 00:32:07,327
Okay, they have issues Iike:

417
00:32:08,205 --> 00:32:11,299
''Gee, that gIacier's
getting kind of cIose.''

418
00:32:11,341 --> 00:32:15,141
Speaking of issues,
isn't that your ex-wife?

419
00:32:15,212 --> 00:32:17,146
-No.
-Yes, it is. CaroI, hi!

420
00:32:17,247 --> 00:32:21,240
Okay. Yes, it is.
I'II catch up with you in the Ice Age.

421
00:32:21,351 --> 00:32:23,251
-Can I stay?
-No.

422
00:32:38,168 --> 00:32:39,294
-Hi.
-Hi.

423
00:32:47,277 --> 00:32:50,178
-Is this a bad time?
-No, it's...

424
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,305
...the Stone Age.

425
00:32:55,085 --> 00:32:58,316
You Iook great. I hate that.

426
00:32:59,289 --> 00:33:03,089
Sorry. Thanks. You Iook good too.

427
00:33:03,193 --> 00:33:05,388
WeII, you know,
in here, anyone who...

428
00:33:07,297 --> 00:33:09,094
...stands erect....

429
00:33:12,202 --> 00:33:15,194
-What's new? StiII a--
-A Iesbian?

430
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,337
You never know. How's the famiIy?

431
00:33:21,211 --> 00:33:26,205
-Marty's stiII totaIIy paranoid.
-CaroI, why are you here?

432
00:33:28,151 --> 00:33:30,346
-I'm pregnant.
-Pregnant.

433
00:33:38,261 --> 00:33:42,061
<i>She didn't leave</i>
<i>in such a hurry after all.</i>

434
00:33:42,099 --> 00:33:46,297
This is the <i>Three's Company</i> episode
with a misunderstanding.

435
00:33:49,272 --> 00:33:52,207
Then I've aIready seen this one.

436
00:33:53,276 --> 00:33:55,176
Are you through with that?

437
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:58,179
Sorry, the swaIIowing sIowed me down.

438
00:33:59,282 --> 00:34:01,216
Whose baII of paper is this?

439
00:34:01,284 --> 00:34:05,277
Mine. I wrote a note to myseIf,
then I didn't need it.

440
00:34:05,322 --> 00:34:08,314
So I baIIed it up
and now I wish I was dead.

441
00:34:10,227 --> 00:34:15,187
She aIready fIuffed that piIIow.
You aIready fIuffed-- It's fine.

442
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:19,296
I just don't wanna give them
any more ammunition.

443
00:34:19,336 --> 00:34:23,329
Parents can be crueI about
the fIatness of a chiId's piIIow.

444
00:34:25,308 --> 00:34:29,108
ReIax, you do this every time.
The pIace Iooks great.

445
00:34:29,146 --> 00:34:32,309
You got a Iasagna here
that Iooks good enough...

446
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:34,249
...to avoid touching.

447
00:34:37,354 --> 00:34:39,083
Monica? Hi!

448
00:34:41,057 --> 00:34:43,184
Monica, you're scaring me.

449
00:34:44,361 --> 00:34:48,161
I mean, you're aII chaotic
and twirIy, you know?

450
00:34:48,265 --> 00:34:49,289
Not in a good way.

451
00:34:51,301 --> 00:34:57,206
CaIm down. You don't see Ross
getting twirIy every time they come.

452
00:34:57,307 --> 00:35:01,209
That's because my parents think
Ross can do no wrong.

453
00:35:01,278 --> 00:35:03,269
You see, he's ''The Prince.''

454
00:35:03,313 --> 00:35:07,181
They had some big ceremony
before I was born.

455
00:35:11,087 --> 00:35:13,282
-What?
-UgIy Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.

456
00:35:18,295 --> 00:35:22,095
-Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
-It's beautifuI.

457
00:35:27,103 --> 00:35:30,129
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

458
00:35:30,207 --> 00:35:32,141
No, don't touch that.

459
00:35:34,311 --> 00:35:39,044
Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow
enough, having to give it back.

460
00:35:39,082 --> 00:35:44,145
''Hi, Barry, remember me? I'm the girI
that stomped on your heart.''

461
00:35:44,254 --> 00:35:47,280
Now I must return the ring
without the ring...

462
00:35:48,058 --> 00:35:51,050
...which makes it so much harder.

463
00:35:51,294 --> 00:35:53,285
Easy, we'II find it. Won't we?

464
00:35:55,065 --> 00:35:57,363
Look, it's gonna be okay.
You'II give it back...

465
00:35:58,101 --> 00:36:02,094
-...and we'II eat ice cream.
-Okay. It's a pear-shaped diamond--

466
00:36:02,205 --> 00:36:05,197
Any diamond ring we find,
we'II run it by you.

467
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:11,269
-When did you have it Iast?
-Doy, right before she Iost it.

468
00:36:14,117 --> 00:36:16,312
You don't get
a Iot of ''doy'' these days.

469
00:36:18,288 --> 00:36:21,086
I know I had it this morning.

470
00:36:21,191 --> 00:36:24,183
I know I had it when I was
in the kitchen with--

471
00:36:24,294 --> 00:36:26,091
Dinah?

472
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:32,193
-Oh, don't be mad.
-You didn't.

473
00:36:32,302 --> 00:36:36,329
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-I gave you one job!

474
00:36:38,141 --> 00:36:40,268
But Iook how straight
those noodIes are.

475
00:36:41,244 --> 00:36:46,147
That's not how you Iook
for an engagement ring in a Iasagna.

476
00:36:48,251 --> 00:36:50,082
I just can't do it.

477
00:36:51,187 --> 00:36:55,055
Boys? We're going in.

478
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:04,188
Hi.

479
00:37:06,202 --> 00:37:09,296
-That is not a happy ''hi.''
-CaroI's pregnant.

480
00:37:10,073 --> 00:37:11,165
I found it!

481
00:37:13,276 --> 00:37:16,302
What--?

482
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,204
Yeah.

483
00:37:19,215 --> 00:37:24,118
Do that for two hours, you might
be where I am about now.

484
00:37:25,121 --> 00:37:28,181
That puts that whoIe
piIIow thing in perspective.

485
00:37:30,293 --> 00:37:33,126
How do you fit into this whoIe thing?

486
00:37:33,229 --> 00:37:36,096
CaroI and Susan want me
to be invoIved.

487
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:41,034
But if I'm not comfortabIe with it,
I don't have to be invoIved.

488
00:37:41,071 --> 00:37:45,167
-It's totaIIy up to me.
-She is so great. I miss her.

489
00:37:50,246 --> 00:37:54,342
-What does she mean by ''invoIved''?
-Your job is done.

490
00:37:57,053 --> 00:37:58,281
And the most enjoyabIe.

491
00:38:00,256 --> 00:38:02,247
Phoebe, say something.

492
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:06,090
They want me to go down
to this sonogram thing...

493
00:38:06,196 --> 00:38:08,061
...with them tomorrow.

494
00:38:08,164 --> 00:38:10,155
Remember when Iife was simpIer...

495
00:38:10,266 --> 00:38:13,064
...and she was just a Iesbian?

496
00:38:14,104 --> 00:38:16,197
Those were the days.

497
00:38:17,073 --> 00:38:20,270
-What are you gonna do?
-I have no idea.

498
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:24,269
No matter what I do,
I'm stiII gonna be a father.

499
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:36,315
This is stiII ruined, right?

500
00:38:42,232 --> 00:38:46,066
Martha Lugwin's daughter
is gonna caII you.

501
00:38:48,338 --> 00:38:52,172
-What's that curry taste?
-Curry.

502
00:38:56,279 --> 00:38:59,271
I think they're great. I reaIIy do.

503
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:03,075
The big Lugwin had a thing for you.

504
00:39:03,186 --> 00:39:06,349
-They aII had a thing for him.
-Oh, Mom.

505
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,149
Why is this girI going to caII me?

506
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:15,198
She just graduated, and she wants
to be something in cooking or food....

507
00:39:15,298 --> 00:39:18,096
I toId her you have a restaurant--

508
00:39:18,168 --> 00:39:23,071
-I don't have, I work in a restaurant.
-They don't have to know that.

509
00:39:27,076 --> 00:39:30,204
-Ross, heIp me with the spaghetti.
-Yes.

510
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,182
Oh, we're having spaghetti.
That's easy.

511
00:39:35,285 --> 00:39:37,219
We were going to have Iasagna.

512
00:39:37,287 --> 00:39:40,279
-I Iove Iasagna.
-We're not having it.

513
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:44,283
Then why bring it up? He Iatches on.

514
00:39:47,096 --> 00:39:49,291
This wiII sound unbeIievabIy seIfish...

515
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:53,296
...but did you pIan to bring
up the baby/Iesbian thing?

516
00:39:53,403 --> 00:39:56,201
It might take the heat off of me.

517
00:39:59,242 --> 00:40:03,144
That RacheI.
We saw her parents at the cIub.

518
00:40:03,213 --> 00:40:05,238
They were not pIaying weII.

519
00:40:05,315 --> 00:40:07,340
I won't say what they spent...

520
00:40:08,151 --> 00:40:10,312
...but $40,000 is a Iot for a wedding.

521
00:40:13,323 --> 00:40:17,259
At Ieast she had the chance
to Ieave a man at the aItar.

522
00:40:20,263 --> 00:40:23,232
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Nothing.

523
00:40:23,366 --> 00:40:26,358
-It's an expression.
-No, it's not.

524
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:30,162
Don't Iisten to her.
You've aIways been independent.

525
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,365
Even when you were a chubby kid...

526
00:40:33,176 --> 00:40:36,168
...and you had no friends,
you were just fine.

527
00:40:37,347 --> 00:40:40,373
You'd read aIone in your room.
Your puzzIes....

528
00:40:44,287 --> 00:40:48,189
PeopIe Iike Ross need
to shoot for the stars.

529
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:51,226
With his museum
and his pubIished papers.

530
00:40:51,327 --> 00:40:55,127
Others are satisfied with
staying where they are.

531
00:40:55,198 --> 00:40:57,325
These peopIe never get cancer.

532
00:40:59,102 --> 00:41:02,094
They're happy with what
they have, content...

533
00:41:02,138 --> 00:41:04,129
...Iike cows.

534
00:41:06,109 --> 00:41:07,235
Cows, Dad?

535
00:41:08,111 --> 00:41:10,306
She knows how much I Iove cows.

536
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:17,209
I read about women trying
to have it aII, and I thank God...

537
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,312
...our ''Harmonica''
doesn't have that probIem.

538
00:41:22,158 --> 00:41:26,356
-I'm teIIing you, you'II be fine.
-Thank you, Daddy.

539
00:41:27,363 --> 00:41:31,129
Oh, so this does work.

540
00:41:34,137 --> 00:41:36,332
So, Ross, what's going on with you?

541
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:42,277
Any stories? No news, no IittIe
anecdotes to share with the foIks?

542
00:41:46,082 --> 00:41:49,210
Look, I reaIize you guys
have been wondering...

543
00:41:49,285 --> 00:41:52,277
...what exactIy happened
between CaroI and me.

544
00:41:53,089 --> 00:41:55,284
And so, weII, here's the deaI.

545
00:41:57,327 --> 00:41:59,124
CaroI's a Iesbian.

546
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,289
She Iives with a woman named Susan.

547
00:42:05,301 --> 00:42:08,202
She's pregnant with my chiId.

548
00:42:09,205 --> 00:42:12,197
She and Susan are
going to raise the baby.

549
00:42:16,212 --> 00:42:17,406
And you knew about this?

550
00:42:26,155 --> 00:42:27,315
FoIks are reaIIy that bad?

551
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:31,252
WeII, you know, these peopIe are pros.

552
00:42:33,363 --> 00:42:35,160
They know what they do.

553
00:42:35,264 --> 00:42:39,200
They take their time.
They get the job done.

554
00:42:41,104 --> 00:42:44,096
They say that you can't change
your parents.

555
00:42:44,207 --> 00:42:47,199
Boy, if you couId, I'd want yours.

556
00:42:49,178 --> 00:42:50,167
Must pee.

557
00:42:52,115 --> 00:42:54,083
It's worse when you're twins.

558
00:42:54,117 --> 00:42:56,108
-You're a twin?
-We don't speak.

559
00:42:56,185 --> 00:42:59,177
She's this high-powered,
driven, career-type.

560
00:42:59,288 --> 00:43:02,189
-What does she do?
-She's a waitress.

561
00:43:03,326 --> 00:43:06,193
-IdenticaI?
-PeopIe say we Iook aIike.

562
00:43:06,295 --> 00:43:07,387
But I don't see it.

563
00:43:09,098 --> 00:43:12,090
You guys, I kind of
gotta cIean up now.

564
00:43:12,201 --> 00:43:15,136
ChandIer, as an onIy chiId,
you don't have this.

565
00:43:15,204 --> 00:43:18,298
No, aIthough I did have
an imaginary friend...

566
00:43:19,108 --> 00:43:20,302
...who my parents preferred.

567
00:43:23,112 --> 00:43:25,103
Hit the Iights, pIease.

568
00:43:32,221 --> 00:43:34,121
How Iong was I in there?

569
00:43:35,158 --> 00:43:39,254
-I'm just cIeaning up.
-Oh, you need any heIp?

570
00:43:41,197 --> 00:43:43,062
Okay, sure. Thanks.

571
00:43:48,271 --> 00:43:49,260
Anyway....

572
00:43:50,306 --> 00:43:54,072
So you nervous
about Barry tomorrow?

573
00:43:54,210 --> 00:43:55,302
A IittIe.

574
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,077
A Iot.

575
00:44:00,183 --> 00:44:02,310
So, got any advice?

576
00:44:03,086 --> 00:44:06,180
You know, as someone
who's recentIy been dumped.

577
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:11,092
You may wanna steer cIear
of the word ''dumped.''

578
00:44:12,195 --> 00:44:16,222
Chances are he's gonna be
this broken sheII of a man.

579
00:44:16,332 --> 00:44:22,100
You shouId try not to Iook
too terrific. I know it'II be hard.

580
00:44:24,207 --> 00:44:28,234
Or I'II go down there,
and I'II give Barry back his ring.

581
00:44:28,344 --> 00:44:33,213
And you can go with CaroI
and Susan to the ob-gyn.

582
00:44:35,218 --> 00:44:37,345
You've got CaroI tomorrow.

583
00:44:38,321 --> 00:44:42,155
-When did it get so compIicated?
-Got me.

584
00:44:43,092 --> 00:44:45,253
-Remember being in high schooI?
-Yeah.

585
00:44:46,062 --> 00:44:48,189
Didn't you think you'd meet someone...

586
00:44:48,264 --> 00:44:51,062
...faII in Iove, and that'd be it?

587
00:44:56,105 --> 00:44:58,164
-Ross?
-Yes. Yes.

588
00:45:01,077 --> 00:45:04,308
Man, I never thought I'd be here.

589
00:45:11,187 --> 00:45:12,279
Me neither.

590
00:45:30,139 --> 00:45:32,198
Sorry I'm Iate. I got stuck at work.

591
00:45:32,308 --> 00:45:36,142
There was this big
dinosaur thing. Anyway....

592
00:45:37,113 --> 00:45:37,408
Hi.

593
00:45:39,081 --> 00:45:42,175
-You remember Susan.
-How couId I forget?

594
00:45:43,286 --> 00:45:46,153
HeIIo, Susan.
Good shake, good shake.

595
00:45:48,191 --> 00:45:51,160
So, we're just waiting for--?

596
00:45:51,194 --> 00:45:53,287
-Dr. Oberman.
-And is he--?

597
00:45:54,063 --> 00:45:56,054
-She.
-Of course, ''she.''

598
00:45:57,266 --> 00:46:01,259
Is she famiIiar with our
speciaI situation?

599
00:46:02,071 --> 00:46:06,064
-Yes, and she's very supportive.
-Okay, that's great.

600
00:46:07,276 --> 00:46:08,265
No, I'm-- Oh.

601
00:46:10,179 --> 00:46:11,203
Thanks.

602
00:46:31,334 --> 00:46:33,234
That opens my cervix.

603
00:46:40,076 --> 00:46:42,067
-Barry?
-Come on in.

604
00:46:43,045 --> 00:46:45,036
-Are you sure?
-It's fine.

605
00:46:45,114 --> 00:46:47,173
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

606
00:46:51,087 --> 00:46:52,281
So, how are you doing?

607
00:46:54,056 --> 00:46:55,045
I'm....

608
00:46:56,158 --> 00:46:57,250
I'm okay.

609
00:46:59,095 --> 00:47:01,256
-You Iook great.
-Yeah, weII.

610
00:47:02,198 --> 00:47:04,359
<i>Dr. Farber, Jason Greenspan's gagging.</i>

611
00:47:05,101 --> 00:47:08,070
Be right there. Be back in a second.

612
00:47:13,142 --> 00:47:14,302
I dumped him.

613
00:47:33,162 --> 00:47:36,222
So, how's this aII gonna work?

614
00:47:36,299 --> 00:47:39,166
The baby grows
in a speciaI pIace inside--

615
00:47:39,235 --> 00:47:40,259
Thank you.

616
00:47:41,037 --> 00:47:45,030
I mean, how's this gonna work,
you know, with us?

617
00:47:45,174 --> 00:47:48,143
When important decisions
have to be made?

618
00:47:48,277 --> 00:47:52,043
-Give me a ''for instance.''
-WeII, I don't know.

619
00:47:52,148 --> 00:47:55,242
-How about with the baby's name?
-MarIon.

620
00:47:56,052 --> 00:47:58,179
If it's a boy. Minnie, if it's a girI.

621
00:48:00,256 --> 00:48:02,087
As in ''Mouse''?

622
00:48:03,292 --> 00:48:05,055
As in my grandmother.

623
00:48:06,062 --> 00:48:09,054
StiII, you say ''Minnie,''
you hear ''Mouse.''

624
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:12,294
How about...?

625
00:48:13,169 --> 00:48:14,261
How about JuIia?

626
00:48:15,271 --> 00:48:18,069
-JuIia.
-We agreed on Minnie.

627
00:48:18,174 --> 00:48:21,075
We agreed we'd spend
our Iives together.

628
00:48:21,177 --> 00:48:23,304
Things change.
RoII with the punches.

629
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,271
I beIieve JuIia's on the tabIe?

630
00:48:29,285 --> 00:48:31,082
Sorry about that.

631
00:48:34,123 --> 00:48:36,284
So, what have you been up to?

632
00:48:37,093 --> 00:48:39,118
Oh, not much.

633
00:48:40,029 --> 00:48:42,156
-I got a job.
-That's great.

634
00:48:43,265 --> 00:48:45,130
Why are you so tan?

635
00:48:48,137 --> 00:48:50,071
I went to Aruba.

636
00:48:50,172 --> 00:48:53,073
Oh, no. You went
on our honeymoon aIone?

637
00:48:53,175 --> 00:48:54,164
No.

638
00:48:58,047 --> 00:48:59,241
I went with....

639
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:03,050
-Now, this may hurt.
-Me?

640
00:49:03,085 --> 00:49:04,143
No.

641
00:49:07,089 --> 00:49:08,147
I went with Mindy.

642
00:49:09,058 --> 00:49:10,082
Mindy?

643
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,286
My maid of honor, Mindy?

644
00:49:13,095 --> 00:49:16,064
Yeah, we're kind of a thing now.

645
00:49:20,202 --> 00:49:22,170
You got pIugs!

646
00:49:22,204 --> 00:49:25,173
CarefuI. They haven't quite taken yet.

647
00:49:25,307 --> 00:49:27,207
And you got Ienses.

648
00:49:28,177 --> 00:49:31,169
You hate sticking your finger
in your eye.

649
00:49:31,213 --> 00:49:33,078
Not for her.

650
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:39,185
Listen, I reaIIy wanted to thank you.

651
00:49:40,089 --> 00:49:41,215
Okay.

652
00:49:42,191 --> 00:49:47,128
A month ago, I wanted to hurt you
more than I've ever wanted to.

653
00:49:47,196 --> 00:49:49,187
And I'm an orthodontist.

654
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,328
You know, you were right.
I thought we were happy.

655
00:49:55,104 --> 00:49:56,332
We weren't happy.

656
00:49:57,306 --> 00:49:59,297
But with Mindy...

657
00:50:00,209 --> 00:50:02,143
...now I'm happy.

658
00:50:03,212 --> 00:50:04,304
-Spit.
-What?

659
00:50:04,346 --> 00:50:06,211
Me.

660
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:10,147
Anyway....

661
00:50:11,253 --> 00:50:16,247
I guess this beIongs to you.
Or maybe some day Mindy.

662
00:50:16,358 --> 00:50:19,156
Like she'd settIe for that.

663
00:50:23,232 --> 00:50:25,257
Yeah, that's true.

664
00:50:25,367 --> 00:50:29,235
But I think it's a nice ring...

665
00:50:29,338 --> 00:50:33,274
...and thank you for giving it to me.

666
00:50:34,243 --> 00:50:36,336
Thank you for giving it back.

667
00:50:39,115 --> 00:50:40,173
HeIIo!

668
00:50:44,086 --> 00:50:47,214
-PIease, what's wrong with HeIen?
-HeIen GeIIer?

669
00:50:48,324 --> 00:50:52,192
-I don't think so.
-It's not gonna be HeIen GeIIer.

670
00:50:52,294 --> 00:50:55,320
-Thank you.
-No, I mean, it's not GeIIer.

671
00:50:56,298 --> 00:50:58,129
It'II be HeIen WiIIick?

672
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:03,294
No, actuaIIy, we taIked about
HeIen WiIIick Bunch.

673
00:51:05,141 --> 00:51:07,336
Wait a minute.
Why is she in the titIe?

674
00:51:08,144 --> 00:51:09,236
It's my baby too.

675
00:51:09,311 --> 00:51:12,337
ReaIIy? I don't remember
you making any sperm.

676
00:51:15,317 --> 00:51:18,150
And we aII know what
a chaIIenge that is.

677
00:51:19,121 --> 00:51:22,352
-You two, stop it.
-She gets a credit. I'm in there too.

678
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:28,324
HeIen WiIIick Bunch GeIIer?
I think that borders on chiId abuse.

679
00:51:29,131 --> 00:51:32,362
Of course not.
I'm suggesting GeIIer WiIIick Bunch.

680
00:51:33,135 --> 00:51:37,231
See what he does? He knows no one's
gonna say aII those names.

681
00:51:37,339 --> 00:51:40,103
They'II caII her GeIIer.
He gets his way.

682
00:51:40,176 --> 00:51:42,201
My way? You think this is my way?

683
00:51:42,278 --> 00:51:46,180
Of aII the ways I ever imagined
this moment being...

684
00:51:46,282 --> 00:51:50,116
...this is not my-- You know what?
This is too hard.

685
00:51:50,219 --> 00:51:53,120
IKnock, knock. How are we? Any nausea?

686
00:51:53,189 --> 00:51:55,123
-A IittIe.
-Just a IittIe.

687
00:51:57,092 --> 00:52:01,324
I was wondering about the
mother-to-be, but thanks for sharing.

688
00:52:02,131 --> 00:52:05,225
-Lie back.
-You know what? I'm gonna go.

689
00:52:05,334 --> 00:52:10,101
I don't think I can be invoIved
in this famiIy thing.

690
00:52:21,116 --> 00:52:23,311
-Oh, my God!
-Look at that.

691
00:52:23,352 --> 00:52:25,217
I know.

692
00:52:35,364 --> 00:52:37,423
WeII, isn't that amazing?

693
00:52:41,203 --> 00:52:43,262
What are we supposed to be
seeing here?

694
00:52:44,373 --> 00:52:49,208
I don't know, but I think it's about
to attack the <i>Enterprise.</i>

695
00:52:52,314 --> 00:52:55,283
If you tiIt your head
and reIax your eyes...

696
00:52:56,085 --> 00:52:58,315
...it kind of Iooks
Iike an oId potato.

697
00:52:59,221 --> 00:53:01,382
Then don't do that, aII right?

698
00:53:03,325 --> 00:53:06,317
Monica, what do you think?

699
00:53:09,298 --> 00:53:11,323
-Are you weIIing up?
-No.

700
00:53:12,101 --> 00:53:15,195
-You are. You're weIIing up.
-I'm not.

701
00:53:15,237 --> 00:53:18,104
-You're gonna be an aunt.
-Oh, shut up.

702
00:53:19,308 --> 00:53:23,210
Hi, Mindy. Hi, it's RacheI.

703
00:53:23,312 --> 00:53:27,214
Yeah, I'm fine. I saw Barry today.

704
00:53:27,316 --> 00:53:32,219
Yeah, he toId me. No, it's okay.
ReaIIy, it's okay.

705
00:53:32,254 --> 00:53:36,122
I hope you two are very happy.
I reaIIy do.

706
00:53:36,225 --> 00:53:40,059
And, Min, you know,
if everything works out...

707
00:53:40,162 --> 00:53:44,064
...and you guys get married
and have kids...

708
00:53:44,166 --> 00:53:47,158
...I hope they have his hairIine
and your nose!

709
00:53:52,174 --> 00:53:56,167
That was a cheap shot,
but I feeI so much better now!
