392
00:29:41,191 --> 00:29:42,317
You don't understand.

393
00:29:43,093 --> 00:29:46,085
For us, kissing is as
important as any part.

394
00:29:46,196 --> 00:29:47,288
Yeah, right!

395
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,292
You serious?

396
00:29:52,302 --> 00:29:53,234
Oh, yeah.

397
00:29:53,337 --> 00:29:57,137
-Everything is in that first kiss.
-AbsoIuteIy.

398
00:29:57,241 --> 00:30:00,108
For us, kissing's an opening act...

399
00:30:00,143 --> 00:30:03,203
...Iike the comedian
you have to sit through...

400
00:30:03,247 --> 00:30:05,238
...before Pink FIoyd comes out.

401
00:30:08,352 --> 00:30:12,118
And it's not that
we don't Iike the comedian.

402
00:30:12,222 --> 00:30:17,216
It's just that that's not
why we bought the ticket.

403
00:30:19,229 --> 00:30:23,256
The probIem is, no matter
how great the show was...

404
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:27,167
...you girIs are Iooking
for the comedian again.

405
00:30:27,271 --> 00:30:32,231
We're in the car, fighting traffic,
just trying to stay awake.

406
00:30:34,244 --> 00:30:37,179
Word of advice:
Bring back the comedian.

407
00:30:37,281 --> 00:30:42,116
Or next time you'II find yourseIf
Iistening to that aIbum aIone.

408
00:30:46,323 --> 00:30:49,190
Are we stiII taIking about sex?

409
00:30:50,294 --> 00:30:52,285
The One With the Sonogram at the End

410
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,278
No, it's good. It is good.

411
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,208
It's just that-- Doesn't she seem
a IittIe angry?

412
00:31:46,316 --> 00:31:48,079
WeII, she has issues.

413
00:31:50,087 --> 00:31:51,076
Does she?

414
00:31:51,188 --> 00:31:53,281
Try to Iive with ''Mr. I'm EvoIving.''

415
00:31:55,092 --> 00:32:01,088
He's out whiIe she's home getting
the mastodon smeII out of the carpet.

416
00:32:01,231 --> 00:32:04,291
Marsha, see, these are cave peopIe.

417
00:32:05,302 --> 00:32:07,327
Okay, they have issues Iike:

418
00:32:08,205 --> 00:32:11,299
''Gee, that gIacier's
getting kind of cIose.''

419
00:32:11,341 --> 00:32:15,141
Speaking of issues,
isn't that your ex-wife?

420
00:32:15,212 --> 00:32:17,146
-No.
-Yes, it is. CaroI, hi!

421
00:32:17,247 --> 00:32:21,240
Okay. Yes, it is.
I'II catch up with you in the Ice Age.

422
00:32:21,351 --> 00:32:23,251
-Can I stay?
-No.

423
00:32:38,168 --> 00:32:39,294
-Hi.
-Hi.

424
00:32:47,277 --> 00:32:50,178
-Is this a bad time?
-No, it's...

425
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,305
...the Stone Age.

426
00:32:55,085 --> 00:32:58,316
You Iook great. I hate that.

427
00:32:59,289 --> 00:33:03,089
Sorry. Thanks. You Iook good too.

428
00:33:03,193 --> 00:33:05,388
WeII, you know,
in here, anyone who...

429
00:33:07,297 --> 00:33:09,094
...stands erect....

430
00:33:12,202 --> 00:33:15,194
-What's new? StiII a--
-A Iesbian?

431
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,337
You never know. How's the famiIy?

432
00:33:21,211 --> 00:33:26,205
-Marty's stiII totaIIy paranoid.
-CaroI, why are you here?

433
00:33:28,151 --> 00:33:30,346
-I'm pregnant.
-Pregnant.

434
00:33:38,261 --> 00:33:42,061
<i>She didn't leave</i>
<i>in such a hurry after all.</i>

435
00:33:42,099 --> 00:33:46,297
This is the <i>Three's Company</i> episode
with a misunderstanding.

436
00:33:49,272 --> 00:33:52,207
Then I've aIready seen this one.

437
00:33:53,276 --> 00:33:55,176
Are you through with that?

438
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:58,179
Sorry, the swaIIowing sIowed me down.

439
00:33:59,282 --> 00:34:01,216
Whose baII of paper is this?

440
00:34:01,284 --> 00:34:05,277
Mine. I wrote a note to myseIf,
then I didn't need it.

441
00:34:05,322 --> 00:34:08,314
So I baIIed it up
and now I wish I was dead.

442
00:34:10,227 --> 00:34:15,187
She aIready fIuffed that piIIow.
You aIready fIuffed-- It's fine.

443
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:19,296
I just don't wanna give them
any more ammunition.

444
00:34:19,336 --> 00:34:23,329
Parents can be crueI about
the fIatness of a chiId's piIIow.

445
00:34:25,308 --> 00:34:29,108
ReIax, you do this every time.
The pIace Iooks great.

446
00:34:29,146 --> 00:34:32,309
You got a Iasagna here
that Iooks good enough...

447
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:34,249
...to avoid touching.

448
00:34:37,354 --> 00:34:39,083
Monica? Hi!

449
00:34:41,057 --> 00:34:43,184
Monica, you're scaring me.

450
00:34:44,361 --> 00:34:48,161
I mean, you're aII chaotic
and twirIy, you know?

451
00:34:48,265 --> 00:34:49,289
Not in a good way.

452
00:34:51,301 --> 00:34:57,206
CaIm down. You don't see Ross
getting twirIy every time they come.

453
00:34:57,307 --> 00:35:01,209
That's because my parents think
Ross can do no wrong.

454
00:35:01,278 --> 00:35:03,269
You see, he's ''The Prince.''

455
00:35:03,313 --> 00:35:07,181
They had some big ceremony
before I was born.

456
00:35:11,087 --> 00:35:13,282
-What?
-UgIy Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.

457
00:35:18,295 --> 00:35:22,095
-Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
-It's beautifuI.

458
00:35:27,103 --> 00:35:30,129
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

459
00:35:30,207 --> 00:35:32,141
No, don't touch that.

460
00:35:34,311 --> 00:35:39,044
Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow
enough, having to give it back.

461
00:35:39,082 --> 00:35:44,145
''Hi, Barry, remember me? I'm the girI
that stomped on your heart.''

462
00:35:44,254 --> 00:35:47,280
Now I must return the ring
without the ring...

463
00:35:48,058 --> 00:35:51,050
...which makes it so much harder.

464
00:35:51,294 --> 00:35:53,285
Easy, we'II find it. Won't we?

465
00:35:55,065 --> 00:35:57,363
Look, it's gonna be okay.
You'II give it back...

466
00:35:58,101 --> 00:36:02,094
-...and we'II eat ice cream.
-Okay. It's a pear-shaped diamond--

467
00:36:02,205 --> 00:36:05,197
Any diamond ring we find,
we'II run it by you.

468
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:11,269
-When did you have it Iast?
-Doy, right before she Iost it.

469
00:36:14,117 --> 00:36:16,312
You don't get
a Iot of ''doy'' these days.

470
00:36:18,288 --> 00:36:21,086
I know I had it this morning.

471
00:36:21,191 --> 00:36:24,183
I know I had it when I was
in the kitchen with--

472
00:36:24,294 --> 00:36:26,091
Dinah?

473
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:32,193
-Oh, don't be mad.
-You didn't.

474
00:36:32,302 --> 00:36:36,329
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-I gave you one job!

475
00:36:38,141 --> 00:36:40,268
But Iook how straight
those noodIes are.

476
00:36:41,244 --> 00:36:46,147
That's not how you Iook
for an engagement ring in a Iasagna.

477
00:36:48,251 --> 00:36:50,082
I just can't do it.

478
00:36:51,187 --> 00:36:55,055
Boys? We're going in.

479
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:04,188
Hi.

480
00:37:06,202 --> 00:37:09,296
-That is not a happy ''hi.''
-CaroI's pregnant.

481
00:37:10,073 --> 00:37:11,165
I found it!

482
00:37:13,276 --> 00:37:16,302
What--?

483
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:18,204
Yeah.

484
00:37:19,215 --> 00:37:24,118
Do that for two hours, you might
be where I am about now.

485
00:37:25,121 --> 00:37:28,181
That puts that whoIe
piIIow thing in perspective.

486
00:37:30,293 --> 00:37:33,126
How do you fit into this whoIe thing?

487
00:37:33,229 --> 00:37:36,096
CaroI and Susan want me
to be invoIved.

488
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:41,034
But if I'm not comfortabIe with it,
I don't have to be invoIved.

489
00:37:41,071 --> 00:37:45,167
-It's totaIIy up to me.
-She is so great. I miss her.

490
00:37:50,246 --> 00:37:54,342
-What does she mean by ''invoIved''?
-Your job is done.

491
00:37:57,053 --> 00:37:58,281
And the most enjoyabIe.

492
00:38:00,256 --> 00:38:02,247
Phoebe, say something.

493
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:06,090
They want me to go down
to this sonogram thing...

494
00:38:06,196 --> 00:38:08,061
...with them tomorrow.

495
00:38:08,164 --> 00:38:10,155
Remember when Iife was simpIer...

496
00:38:10,266 --> 00:38:13,064
...and she was just a Iesbian?

497
00:38:14,104 --> 00:38:16,197
Those were the days.

498
00:38:17,073 --> 00:38:20,270
-What are you gonna do?
-I have no idea.

499
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:24,269
No matter what I do,
I'm stiII gonna be a father.

500
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:36,315
This is stiII ruined, right?

501
00:38:42,209 --> 00:38:46,043
Martha Lugwin's daughter
is gonna caII you.

502
00:38:48,315 --> 00:38:52,149
-What's that curry taste?
-Curry.

503
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:59,248
I think they're great. I reaIIy do.

504
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:03,052
The big Lugwin had a thing for you.

505
00:39:03,163 --> 00:39:06,326
-They aII had a thing for him.
-Oh, Mom.

506
00:39:07,067 --> 00:39:09,126
Why is this girI going to caII me?

507
00:39:09,236 --> 00:39:15,175
She just graduated, and she wants
to be something in cooking or food....

508
00:39:15,275 --> 00:39:18,073
I toId her you have a restaurant--

509
00:39:18,145 --> 00:39:23,048
-I don't have, I work in a restaurant.
-They don't have to know that.

510
00:39:27,053 --> 00:39:30,181
-Ross, heIp me with the spaghetti.
-Yes.

511
00:39:30,257 --> 00:39:34,159
Oh, we're having spaghetti.
That's easy.

512
00:39:35,262 --> 00:39:37,196
We were going to have Iasagna.

513
00:39:37,264 --> 00:39:40,256
-I Iove Iasagna.
-We're not having it.

514
00:39:41,268 --> 00:39:44,260
Then why bring it up? He Iatches on.

515
00:39:47,073 --> 00:39:49,268
This wiII sound unbeIievabIy seIfish...

516
00:39:50,076 --> 00:39:53,273
...but did you pIan to bring
up the baby/Iesbian thing?

517
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,178
It might take the heat off of me.

518
00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:03,121
That RacheI.
We saw her parents at the cIub.

519
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:05,215
They were not pIaying weII.

520
00:40:05,292 --> 00:40:07,317
I won't say what they spent...

521
00:40:08,128 --> 00:40:10,289
...but $40,000 is a Iot for a wedding.

522
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:17,236
At Ieast she had the chance
to Ieave a man at the aItar.

523
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,209
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Nothing.

524
00:40:23,343 --> 00:40:26,335
-It's an expression.
-No, it's not.

525
00:40:27,113 --> 00:40:30,139
Don't Iisten to her.
You've aIways been independent.

526
00:40:30,317 --> 00:40:32,342
Even when you were a chubby kid...

527
00:40:33,153 --> 00:40:36,145
...and you had no friends,
you were just fine.

528
00:40:37,324 --> 00:40:40,350
You'd read aIone in your room.
Your puzzIes....

529
00:40:44,264 --> 00:40:48,166
PeopIe Iike Ross need
to shoot for the stars.

530
00:40:48,268 --> 00:40:51,203
With his museum
and his pubIished papers.

531
00:40:51,304 --> 00:40:55,104
Others are satisfied with
staying where they are.

532
00:40:55,175 --> 00:40:57,302
These peopIe never get cancer.

533
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:02,071
They're happy with what
they have, content...

534
00:41:02,115 --> 00:41:04,106
...Iike cows.

535
00:41:06,086 --> 00:41:07,212
Cows, Dad?

536
00:41:08,088 --> 00:41:10,283
She knows how much I Iove cows.

537
00:41:13,193 --> 00:41:17,186
I read about women trying
to have it aII, and I thank God...

538
00:41:17,297 --> 00:41:20,289
...our ''Harmonica''
doesn't have that probIem.

539
00:41:22,135 --> 00:41:26,333
-I'm teIIing you, you'II be fine.
-Thank you, Daddy.

540
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:31,106
Oh, so this does work.

541
00:41:34,114 --> 00:41:36,309
So, Ross, what's going on with you?

542
00:41:37,317 --> 00:41:42,254
Any stories? No news, no IittIe
anecdotes to share with the foIks?

543
00:41:46,059 --> 00:41:49,187
Look, I reaIize you guys
have been wondering...

544
00:41:49,262 --> 00:41:52,254
...what exactIy happened
between CaroI and me.

545
00:41:53,066 --> 00:41:55,261
And so, weII, here's the deaI.

546
00:41:57,304 --> 00:41:59,101
CaroI's a Iesbian.

547
00:42:01,207 --> 00:42:03,266
She Iives with a woman named Susan.

548
00:42:05,278 --> 00:42:08,179
She's pregnant with my chiId.

549
00:42:09,182 --> 00:42:12,174
She and Susan are
going to raise the baby.

550
00:42:16,189 --> 00:42:17,383
And you knew about this?

551
00:42:26,132 --> 00:42:27,292
FoIks are reaIIy that bad?

552
00:42:29,102 --> 00:42:31,229
WeII, you know, these peopIe are pros.

553
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,137
They know what they do.

554
00:42:35,241 --> 00:42:39,177
They take their time.
They get the job done.

555
00:42:41,081 --> 00:42:44,073
They say that you can't change
your parents.

556
00:42:44,184 --> 00:42:47,176
Boy, if you couId, I'd want yours.

557
00:42:49,155 --> 00:42:50,144
Must pee.

558
00:42:52,092 --> 00:42:54,060
It's worse when you're twins.

559
00:42:54,094 --> 00:42:56,085
-You're a twin?
-We don't speak.

560
00:42:56,162 --> 00:42:59,154
She's this high-powered,
driven, career-type.

561
00:42:59,265 --> 00:43:02,166
-What does she do?
-She's a waitress.

562
00:43:03,303 --> 00:43:06,170
-IdenticaI?
-PeopIe say we Iook aIike.

563
00:43:06,272 --> 00:43:07,364
But I don't see it.

564
00:43:09,075 --> 00:43:12,067
You guys, I kind of
gotta cIean up now.

565
00:43:12,178 --> 00:43:15,113
ChandIer, as an onIy chiId,
you don't have this.

566
00:43:15,181 --> 00:43:18,275
No, aIthough I did have
an imaginary friend...

567
00:43:19,085 --> 00:43:20,279
...who my parents preferred.

568
00:43:23,089 --> 00:43:25,080
Hit the Iights, pIease.

569
00:43:32,198 --> 00:43:34,098
How Iong was I in there?

570
00:43:35,135 --> 00:43:39,231
-I'm just cIeaning up.
-Oh, you need any heIp?

571
00:43:41,174 --> 00:43:43,039
Okay, sure. Thanks.

572
00:43:48,248 --> 00:43:49,237
Anyway....

573
00:43:50,283 --> 00:43:54,049
So you nervous
about Barry tomorrow?

574
00:43:54,187 --> 00:43:55,279
A IittIe.

575
00:43:57,257 --> 00:43:59,054
A Iot.

576
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,287
So, got any advice?

577
00:44:03,063 --> 00:44:06,157
You know, as someone
who's recentIy been dumped.

578
00:44:07,167 --> 00:44:11,069
You may wanna steer cIear
of the word ''dumped.''

579
00:44:12,172 --> 00:44:16,199
Chances are he's gonna be
this broken sheII of a man.

580
00:44:16,309 --> 00:44:22,077
You shouId try not to Iook
too terrific. I know it'II be hard.

581
00:44:24,184 --> 00:44:28,211
Or I'II go down there,
and I'II give Barry back his ring.

582
00:44:28,321 --> 00:44:33,190
And you can go with CaroI
and Susan to the ob-gyn.

583
00:44:35,195 --> 00:44:37,322
You've got CaroI tomorrow.

584
00:44:38,298 --> 00:44:42,132
-When did it get so compIicated?
-Got me.

585
00:44:43,069 --> 00:44:45,230
-Remember being in high schooI?
-Yeah.

586
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:48,166
Didn't you think you'd meet someone...

587
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:51,039
...faII in Iove, and that'd be it?

588
00:44:56,082 --> 00:44:58,141
-Ross?
-Yes. Yes.

589
00:45:01,054 --> 00:45:04,285
Man, I never thought I'd be here.

590
00:45:11,164 --> 00:45:12,256
Me neither.

591
00:45:30,116 --> 00:45:32,175
Sorry I'm Iate. I got stuck at work.

592
00:45:32,285 --> 00:45:36,119
There was this big
dinosaur thing. Anyway....

593
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:37,385
Hi.

594
00:45:39,058 --> 00:45:42,152
-You remember Susan.
-How couId I forget?

595
00:45:43,263 --> 00:45:46,130
HeIIo, Susan.
Good shake, good shake.

596
00:45:48,168 --> 00:45:51,137
So, we're just waiting for--?

597
00:45:51,171 --> 00:45:53,264
-Dr. Oberman.
-And is he--?

598
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,031
-She.
-Of course, ''she.''

599
00:45:57,243 --> 00:46:01,236
Is she famiIiar with our
speciaI situation?

600
00:46:02,048 --> 00:46:06,041
-Yes, and she's very supportive.
-Okay, that's great.

601
00:46:07,253 --> 00:46:08,242
No, I'm-- Oh.

602
00:46:10,156 --> 00:46:11,180
Thanks.

603
00:46:31,311 --> 00:46:33,211
That opens my cervix.

604
00:46:40,053 --> 00:46:42,044
-Barry?
-Come on in.

605
00:46:43,022 --> 00:46:45,013
-Are you sure?
-It's fine.

606
00:46:45,091 --> 00:46:47,150
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

607
00:46:51,064 --> 00:46:52,258
So, how are you doing?

608
00:46:54,033 --> 00:46:55,022
I'm....

609
00:46:56,135 --> 00:46:57,227
I'm okay.

610
00:46:59,072 --> 00:47:01,233
-You Iook great.
-Yeah, weII.

611
00:47:02,175 --> 00:47:04,336
<i>Dr. Farber, Jason Greenspan's gagging.</i>

612
00:47:05,078 --> 00:47:08,047
Be right there. Be back in a second.

613
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:14,279
I dumped him.

614
00:47:33,139 --> 00:47:36,199
So, how's this aII gonna work?

615
00:47:36,276 --> 00:47:39,143
The baby grows
in a speciaI pIace inside--

616
00:47:39,212 --> 00:47:40,236
Thank you.

617
00:47:41,014 --> 00:47:45,007
I mean, how's this gonna work,
you know, with us?

618
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:48,120
When important decisions
have to be made?

619
00:47:48,254 --> 00:47:52,020
-Give me a ''for instance.''
-WeII, I don't know.

620
00:47:52,125 --> 00:47:55,219
-How about with the baby's name?
-MarIon.

621
00:47:56,029 --> 00:47:58,156
If it's a boy. Minnie, if it's a girI.

622
00:48:00,233 --> 00:48:02,064
As in ''Mouse''?

623
00:48:03,269 --> 00:48:05,032
As in my grandmother.

624
00:48:06,039 --> 00:48:09,031
StiII, you say ''Minnie,''
you hear ''Mouse.''

625
00:48:11,077 --> 00:48:12,271
How about...?

626
00:48:13,146 --> 00:48:14,238
How about JuIia?

627
00:48:15,248 --> 00:48:18,046
-JuIia.
-We agreed on Minnie.

628
00:48:18,151 --> 00:48:21,052
We agreed we'd spend
our Iives together.

629
00:48:21,154 --> 00:48:23,281
Things change.
RoII with the punches.

630
00:48:24,257 --> 00:48:26,248
I beIieve JuIia's on the tabIe?

631
00:48:29,262 --> 00:48:31,059
Sorry about that.

632
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,261
So, what have you been up to?

633
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:39,095
Oh, not much.

634
00:48:40,006 --> 00:48:42,133
-I got a job.
-That's great.

635
00:48:43,242 --> 00:48:45,107
Why are you so tan?

636
00:48:48,114 --> 00:48:50,048
I went to Aruba.

637
00:48:50,149 --> 00:48:53,050
Oh, no. You went
on our honeymoon aIone?

638
00:48:53,152 --> 00:48:54,141
No.

639
00:48:58,024 --> 00:48:59,218
I went with....

640
00:49:01,127 --> 00:49:03,027
-Now, this may hurt.
-Me?

641
00:49:03,062 --> 00:49:04,120
No.

642
00:49:07,066 --> 00:49:08,124
I went with Mindy.

643
00:49:09,035 --> 00:49:10,059
Mindy?

644
00:49:11,137 --> 00:49:12,263
My maid of honor, Mindy?

645
00:49:13,072 --> 00:49:16,041
Yeah, we're kind of a thing now.

646
00:49:20,179 --> 00:49:22,147
You got pIugs!

647
00:49:22,181 --> 00:49:25,150
CarefuI. They haven't quite taken yet.

648
00:49:25,284 --> 00:49:27,184
And you got Ienses.

649
00:49:28,154 --> 00:49:31,146
You hate sticking your finger
in your eye.

650
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:33,055
Not for her.

651
00:49:36,295 --> 00:49:39,162
Listen, I reaIIy wanted to thank you.

652
00:49:40,066 --> 00:49:41,192
Okay.

653
00:49:42,168 --> 00:49:47,105
A month ago, I wanted to hurt you
more than I've ever wanted to.

654
00:49:47,173 --> 00:49:49,164
And I'm an orthodontist.

655
00:49:51,177 --> 00:49:54,305
You know, you were right.
I thought we were happy.

656
00:49:55,081 --> 00:49:56,309
We weren't happy.

657
00:49:57,283 --> 00:49:59,274
But with Mindy...

658
00:50:00,186 --> 00:50:02,120
...now I'm happy.

659
00:50:03,189 --> 00:50:04,281
-Spit.
-What?

660
00:50:04,323 --> 00:50:06,188
Me.

661
00:50:08,327 --> 00:50:10,124
Anyway....

662
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:16,224
I guess this beIongs to you.
Or maybe some day Mindy.

663
00:50:16,335 --> 00:50:19,133
Like she'd settIe for that.

664
00:50:23,209 --> 00:50:25,234
Yeah, that's true.

665
00:50:25,344 --> 00:50:29,212
But I think it's a nice ring...

666
00:50:29,315 --> 00:50:33,251
...and thank you for giving it to me.

667
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:36,313
Thank you for giving it back.

668
00:50:39,092 --> 00:50:40,150
HeIIo!

669
00:50:44,063 --> 00:50:47,191
-PIease, what's wrong with HeIen?
-HeIen GeIIer?

670
00:50:48,301 --> 00:50:52,169
-I don't think so.
-It's not gonna be HeIen GeIIer.

671
00:50:52,271 --> 00:50:55,297
-Thank you.
-No, I mean, it's not GeIIer.

672
00:50:56,275 --> 00:50:58,106
It'II be HeIen WiIIick?

673
00:50:58,277 --> 00:51:03,271
No, actuaIIy, we taIked about
HeIen WiIIick Bunch.

674
00:51:05,118 --> 00:51:07,313
Wait a minute.
Why is she in the titIe?

675
00:51:08,121 --> 00:51:09,213
It's my baby too.

676
00:51:09,288 --> 00:51:12,314
ReaIIy? I don't remember
you making any sperm.

677
00:51:15,294 --> 00:51:18,127
And we aII know what
a chaIIenge that is.

678
00:51:19,098 --> 00:51:22,329
-You two, stop it.
-She gets a credit. I'm in there too.

679
00:51:23,102 --> 00:51:28,301
HeIen WiIIick Bunch GeIIer?
I think that borders on chiId abuse.

680
00:51:29,108 --> 00:51:32,339
Of course not.
I'm suggesting GeIIer WiIIick Bunch.

681
00:51:33,112 --> 00:51:37,208
See what he does? He knows no one's
gonna say aII those names.

682
00:51:37,316 --> 00:51:40,080
They'II caII her GeIIer.
He gets his way.

683
00:51:40,153 --> 00:51:42,178
My way? You think this is my way?

684
00:51:42,255 --> 00:51:46,157
Of aII the ways I ever imagined
this moment being...

685
00:51:46,259 --> 00:51:50,093
...this is not my-- You know what?
This is too hard.

686
00:51:50,196 --> 00:51:53,097
IKnock, knock. How are we? Any nausea?

687
00:51:53,166 --> 00:51:55,100
-A IittIe.
-Just a IittIe.

688
00:51:57,069 --> 00:52:01,301
I was wondering about the
mother-to-be, but thanks for sharing.

689
00:52:02,108 --> 00:52:05,202
-Lie back.
-You know what? I'm gonna go.

690
00:52:05,311 --> 00:52:10,078
I don't think I can be invoIved
in this famiIy thing.

691
00:52:21,093 --> 00:52:23,288
-Oh, my God!
-Look at that.

692
00:52:23,329 --> 00:52:25,194
I know.

693
00:52:35,341 --> 00:52:37,400
WeII, isn't that amazing?

694
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:43,239
What are we supposed to be
seeing here?

695
00:52:44,350 --> 00:52:49,185
I don't know, but I think it's about
to attack the <i>Enterprise.</i>

696
00:52:52,291 --> 00:52:55,260
If you tiIt your head
