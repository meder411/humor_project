352
00:23:53,687 --> 00:23:54,881
AII right, no peeking.

353
00:23:55,689 --> 00:23:57,919
No peeking. No peeking. No peeking!

354
00:23:58,692 --> 00:24:02,822
AII right, but you better be
wearing cIothes when I open my eyes.

355
00:24:04,832 --> 00:24:06,800
AII right. Open your eyes.

356
00:24:11,805 --> 00:24:14,933
Sweet mother of aII
that is good and pure!

357
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:20,744
-<i>Days of our Lives</i> picked up my option!
-CongratuIations!

358
00:24:20,948 --> 00:24:25,749
Now we can watch <i>Green Acres</i>
the way it was meant to be seen.

359
00:24:27,721 --> 00:24:28,847
So which one is mine?

360
00:24:28,922 --> 00:24:32,824
Whichever one you want, man.
Whichever one you want!

361
00:24:33,927 --> 00:24:35,861
Not that one.

362
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,926
Oh, yes!

363
00:24:42,736 --> 00:24:45,762
Oh, yeah! That's the stuff.

364
00:24:47,941 --> 00:24:49,841
Do we dare?

365
00:24:49,943 --> 00:24:51,706
We dare.

366
00:24:56,917 --> 00:24:58,908
The One Where Ross and RacheI...You Know

367
00:25:44,831 --> 00:25:48,824
I can't beIieve two cows made a
sacrifice so you guys couId...

368
00:25:48,869 --> 00:25:52,862
-...watch TV with your feet up.
-They were chair-shaped cows.

369
00:25:52,906 --> 00:25:55,875
They never wouId have survived
in the wiId.

370
00:25:56,677 --> 00:26:00,773
This screen is amazing.
Dick Van Dyke is practicaIIy Iife-size.

371
00:26:02,916 --> 00:26:06,716
Rose Marie reaIIy beIongs
on a smaIIer screen.

372
00:26:06,987 --> 00:26:08,921
Hi, you guys.

373
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:12,791
-Hey, you.
-Hey, you.

374
00:26:18,732 --> 00:26:21,929
-How was your day?
-You know, pretty much the usuaI.

375
00:26:22,736 --> 00:26:25,728
-Sun shining, birds chirping.
-ReaIIy? Mine too.

376
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,932
Hey, cooI. Mine too.

377
00:26:30,911 --> 00:26:33,709
I gotta get to the museum.

378
00:26:33,914 --> 00:26:36,906
-I'II see you tonight?
-Okay.

379
00:26:42,856 --> 00:26:43,845
Bye, guys!

380
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,920
Tonight?

381
00:26:50,764 --> 00:26:54,894
-What's tonight?
-Our first officiaI date. First date.

382
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:57,862
HeIIo?

383
00:26:58,805 --> 00:27:00,670
Hi.

384
00:27:01,775 --> 00:27:04,767
You're waitressing
at my catering thing.

385
00:27:04,811 --> 00:27:08,770
-Any of those words trigger anything?
-Monica, I forgot.

386
00:27:08,815 --> 00:27:09,907
It's our first date.

387
00:27:10,684 --> 00:27:13,676
-My mom got me this job.
-I can be a waitress!

388
00:27:13,787 --> 00:27:16,881
Thank you, thank you.
See? Phoebe! Phoebe!

389
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:20,926
You'd have to be an actuaI waitress.
It can't be Iike your...

390
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:23,696
...''I can be a bear cub'' thing.

391
00:27:23,797 --> 00:27:25,924
I can be a waitress. Watch this.

392
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,895
Give me two number ones, 86 the bacon.

393
00:27:29,703 --> 00:27:31,933
One Adam and Eve on a raft
and wreck them!

394
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,853
It's James Bond.

395
00:27:49,723 --> 00:27:52,749
-Sorry we're Iate.
-That's okay. Come on in.

396
00:27:52,793 --> 00:27:55,785
Is Monica GeIIer coming?
I was toId she was.

397
00:27:55,862 --> 00:27:57,693
Dr. Burke, it's me.

398
00:27:57,864 --> 00:27:58,888
Monica?

399
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,793
My God! You used to be so....

400
00:28:01,868 --> 00:28:04,860
I mean, you've--
You must have Iost Iike....

401
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,900
You Iook great.

402
00:28:09,876 --> 00:28:12,970
Thank you. This is Phoebe.
She'II be heIping me.

403
00:28:13,714 --> 00:28:15,682
Nice to meet you.

404
00:28:19,686 --> 00:28:21,916
-How you been?
-Great. How have you been?

405
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:26,885
You know Barbara and I spIit
or you wouIdn't do the head tiIt.

406
00:28:26,993 --> 00:28:28,722
The head tiIt?

407
00:28:28,795 --> 00:28:29,887
Since the divorce...

408
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:35,732
...everybody asks how I am with a
sympathetic head tiIt. ''How you doing?''

409
00:28:35,836 --> 00:28:36,996
I'm sorry.

410
00:28:37,738 --> 00:28:39,831
It's fine.
BeIieve me, I do it too.

411
00:28:39,906 --> 00:28:43,933
I aIways answer with the
''I'm okay'' head bob. ''I'm okay.''

412
00:28:44,811 --> 00:28:47,746
''You're sure?''
''Yeah, I'm fine.''

413
00:28:47,814 --> 00:28:50,908
I gotta set up the music.
I got a new CD changer.

414
00:28:50,951 --> 00:28:54,682
The divorce onIy Ieft
me with four CDs to change.

415
00:28:54,755 --> 00:28:55,881
That's too bad.

416
00:28:56,757 --> 00:28:57,689
I'II survive.

417
00:29:01,862 --> 00:29:05,764
Two Iarges, extra cheese on both.

418
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:07,664
But Iisten...

419
00:29:07,701 --> 00:29:09,896
...don't ring the buzzer for 1 9.

420
00:29:10,704 --> 00:29:12,865
Ring 20. GeIIer/Greene.

421
00:29:13,673 --> 00:29:16,665
They'II Iet you in, okay?

422
00:29:18,678 --> 00:29:21,772
If you buzz our door,
there's no tip for you.

423
00:29:22,716 --> 00:29:24,684
Okay, thanks.

424
00:29:25,886 --> 00:29:29,879
Pizza's on the way.
I toId you we wouIdn't have to get up.

425
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:32,816
What if we have to pee?

426
00:29:35,829 --> 00:29:38,696
I'II canceI the sodas.

427
00:29:41,935 --> 00:29:43,994
Get out there.
It's your party!

428
00:29:44,738 --> 00:29:47,707
They're so duII!
They're aII ophthaImoIogists.

429
00:29:47,941 --> 00:29:51,843
-You're an ophthaImoIogist.
-That's what my parents wanted.

430
00:29:51,878 --> 00:29:54,642
I wanted to be a sheriff.

431
00:29:54,848 --> 00:29:57,942
That's funny. CadiIIac, cataract.
I get it.

432
00:29:58,685 --> 00:30:00,778
No! You stay out there!

433
00:30:01,688 --> 00:30:02,882
-You see?
-I teII you what.

434
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:08,650
I'II come get you in five minutes
with some sort of kebab emergency.

435
00:30:09,863 --> 00:30:12,889
Better. Oh, God, here we go.

436
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:14,895
Want to see them go nuts?

437
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:17,703
Watch this.

438
00:30:17,871 --> 00:30:20,669
Who needs gIasses?

439
00:30:26,913 --> 00:30:29,814
-You are so smitten.
-I am not!

440
00:30:30,784 --> 00:30:33,981
Oh, you are so much
the smitten kitten.

441
00:30:34,888 --> 00:30:36,788
-Ask him out.
-Dr. Burke?

442
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:41,718
I don't think so.
I mean, Iike, he's a grownup.

443
00:30:42,696 --> 00:30:45,790
So? You two are totaIIy
into each other.

444
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:49,699
He's a famiIy friend.
He's 20 years oIder than me.

445
00:30:49,803 --> 00:30:52,636
So you're never gonna see him again?

446
00:30:52,739 --> 00:30:53,831
Not never.

447
00:30:54,774 --> 00:30:57,868
I'm gonna see him tomorrow
at my eye appointment.

448
00:30:58,778 --> 00:31:02,737
-Didn't you just get your eyes checked?
-Yeah, but you know...

449
00:31:02,849 --> 00:31:04,749
...27 is...

450
00:31:04,851 --> 00:31:06,842
...a dangerous eye age.

451
00:31:08,788 --> 00:31:13,657
They're picking teams to pIay
''Guess my prescription.'' HeIp me!

452
00:31:17,764 --> 00:31:21,860
I'm not saying it was a bad movie.
I'm saying it was a IittIe...

453
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:23,658
...hard to foIIow.

454
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:27,897
-I toId you there wouId be subtitIes.
-I know.

455
00:31:28,808 --> 00:31:32,869
I just didn't want to wear
my gIasses on our first date.

456
00:31:40,687 --> 00:31:41,779
Monica?

457
00:31:45,692 --> 00:31:49,890
It wouId heIp when I'm kissing you
if you didn't shout my sister's name.

458
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:51,727
I'm just checking.

459
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:55,630
-Monica?
-Mon?

460
00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:27,764
What?

461
00:32:27,867 --> 00:32:29,664
I'm sorry.

462
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:32,761
When you moved your hands
down to my butt...

463
00:32:32,806 --> 00:32:36,674
...it was, Iike,
''Whoa! Ross's hands are on my butt!''

464
00:32:37,911 --> 00:32:40,675
And that's funny. Why?

465
00:32:41,815 --> 00:32:43,783
WeII, it's not.

466
00:32:43,817 --> 00:32:45,876
Sorry. I'm just nervous.

467
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,821
I mean, it's you. You know, it's us.

468
00:32:49,923 --> 00:32:53,757
We're crossing that Iine.
It's sort of a big thing.

469
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:58,729
WeII, I know it's big.
I just didn't know it was ha-ha big.

470
00:33:09,843 --> 00:33:12,835
Okay, my hands were
nowhere near your butt.

471
00:33:12,879 --> 00:33:14,676
I know! I know!

472
00:33:14,748 --> 00:33:17,876
I was thinking about
the Iast time they were there.

473
00:33:18,651 --> 00:33:20,744
I'm sorry. Look! I promise.

474
00:33:20,787 --> 00:33:23,779
I won't Iaugh anymore.
Put your hands back.

475
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:26,757
No, see, now I can't.

476
00:33:27,794 --> 00:33:31,753
-I'm feeIing too seIf-conscious.
-Touch my butt.

477
00:33:32,699 --> 00:33:35,793
-Just one cheek.
-The moment's gone.

478
00:33:35,902 --> 00:33:38,894
-I'II back up into your hands.
-That's romantic.

479
00:33:39,706 --> 00:33:40,695
<i>-Touch it.</i>
<i>-No.</i>

480
00:33:40,774 --> 00:33:42,674
<i>-Come on, squeeze it.</i>
<i>-No!</i>

481
00:33:42,776 --> 00:33:43,765
<i>-Rub it?</i>
<i>-No.</i>

482
00:33:43,877 --> 00:33:46,812
<i>Oh, come on!</i>
<i>Would you just grab my ass?</i>

483
00:33:53,787 --> 00:33:56,881
Wow! Look at that!
The car is on fire...

484
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,682
...yet somehow
its expensive paint job...

485
00:34:00,794 --> 00:34:03,922
...is protected by the MiracIe Wax.

486
00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:08,800
You got a Chee-to on your face, man.

487
00:34:19,746 --> 00:34:22,806
Aren't you supposed
to be out with RacheI?

488
00:34:22,916 --> 00:34:24,907
That was 1 4 hours ago.

489
00:34:26,953 --> 00:34:29,820
We gotta set the cIock on this.

490
00:34:30,857 --> 00:34:32,825
So how'd it go?

491
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:37,819
Have you ever been, you know,
fooIing around with a girI...

492
00:34:38,765 --> 00:34:40,824
...and she started Iaughing?

493
00:34:41,034 --> 00:34:42,763
Yeah.

494
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:48,774
But it was 1 982 and my FIock of
SeaguIIs haircut tickIed her chin.

495
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:52,871
She Iaughed at you?

496
00:34:52,912 --> 00:34:55,710
It couId have been worse.

497
00:34:55,782 --> 00:34:57,773
I couId have been naked.

498
00:35:02,822 --> 00:35:05,689
I've wanted this since 9th grade.

499
00:35:05,792 --> 00:35:07,726
I want it to be perfect...

500
00:35:07,794 --> 00:35:11,696
...and right and....

501
00:35:11,931 --> 00:35:15,697
Why isn't that Iaser
cutting through the paint?

502
00:35:15,802 --> 00:35:18,896
-It's the MiracIe Wax!
-It certainIy is a miracIe.

503
00:35:19,706 --> 00:35:20,900
-Hi, you guys.
-Hey.

504
00:35:22,842 --> 00:35:24,935
Listen, I was thinking about....

505
00:35:25,745 --> 00:35:26,939
Can you guys speak up?

506
00:35:27,714 --> 00:35:31,013
It's harder for us to hear you
when you Iower your voice.

507
00:35:31,818 --> 00:35:32,910
-HaIIway?
-Yeah.

508
00:35:40,727 --> 00:35:44,823
I'm sorry about Iast night.
I reaIIy want to make it up to you.

509
00:35:44,864 --> 00:35:47,025
There's no need to make it--
How?

510
00:35:48,768 --> 00:35:52,704
WeII, I was thinking maybe
a romantic dinner...

511
00:35:52,805 --> 00:35:55,774
...with candIes and wine.

512
00:35:55,808 --> 00:36:00,871
And then maybe going
back to my pIace for...

513
00:36:01,714 --> 00:36:03,682
...dessert.

514
00:36:04,784 --> 00:36:05,876
That sounds...

515
00:36:05,985 --> 00:36:07,885
...perfect.

516
00:36:15,895 --> 00:36:19,695
-What's this?
-WouId you get us a coupIe of beers?

517
00:36:24,837 --> 00:36:27,704
I'm going to Iook into your eyes now.

518
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,934
ReaIIy?

519
00:36:29,742 --> 00:36:31,733
Yeah, that's my job.

520
00:36:32,712 --> 00:36:34,839
AII right. Look up.

521
00:36:35,915 --> 00:36:36,904
Look down.

522
00:36:37,016 --> 00:36:39,814
No, open your eyes and Iook down.

523
00:36:40,753 --> 00:36:41,742
That's right.

524
00:36:41,821 --> 00:36:43,755
Look into the Iight.

525
00:36:44,824 --> 00:36:46,815
Now Iook at me.

526
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:56,658
Okay!

527
00:36:57,804 --> 00:37:00,773
Your eyes Iook good.
Those are good eyes.

528
00:37:00,873 --> 00:37:02,864
Good. They feeI good.

529
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,768
In my head.

530
00:37:10,683 --> 00:37:12,913
-It was great to see you.
-You too.

531
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,820
You too.

532
00:37:19,826 --> 00:37:21,726
Goodbye.

533
00:37:22,895 --> 00:37:24,886
-Drops!
-What?

534
00:37:25,732 --> 00:37:26,892
Here, they're free.

535
00:37:29,936 --> 00:37:31,836
Thanks.

536
00:37:32,939 --> 00:37:36,705
-I better be going.
-Yeah, I'II see you Iater.

537
00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:38,800
Thanks again.

538
00:37:51,891 --> 00:37:55,793
We have to get you Iazy boys
out of these chairs.

539
00:37:58,765 --> 00:38:02,758
You shouId go out and be with
the three-dimensionaI peopIe.

540
00:38:02,902 --> 00:38:05,894
No. Inside good.

541
00:38:06,873 --> 00:38:09,706
Outside bad.

542
00:38:09,876 --> 00:38:11,901
You guys are so pathetic.

543
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:13,805
Oh, <i>Xanadu</i>!

544
00:38:17,817 --> 00:38:20,684
She's one of us now.

545
00:38:21,721 --> 00:38:23,814
-Hi, you guys.
-Hey.

546
00:38:24,724 --> 00:38:26,919
We wanted to stop by
and say good night.

547
00:38:27,727 --> 00:38:29,695
Good night.

548
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:34,926
-They won't even turn their heads.
-AII right. I'm taking off my shirt.

549
00:38:40,907 --> 00:38:42,898
No. She's Iying.

550
00:38:44,711 --> 00:38:48,841
Stop sending food to our apartment!

551
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:53,751
-Why are you dressed up?
-You're not the onIy one with a date.

552
00:38:53,786 --> 00:38:55,879
-You have a date? Who with?
-No one.

553
00:38:56,689 --> 00:38:58,782
-What's his name?
-Nothing.

554
00:38:59,759 --> 00:39:00,783
Come on, teII me.

555
00:39:01,761 --> 00:39:04,662
AII right, but I'm excited about this.

556
00:39:04,764 --> 00:39:07,858
Promise you won't get
big-brothery and judgmentaI.

557
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:08,899
I promise.

558
00:39:09,702 --> 00:39:11,863
-Richard Burke.
-Who's Richard Burke?

559
00:39:11,971 --> 00:39:13,700
Dr. Burke?

560
00:39:14,774 --> 00:39:17,868
You have a date with Dr. Burke?
Why? Why? Why...

561
00:39:17,977 --> 00:39:20,775
...shouId that bother me?

562
00:39:20,813 --> 00:39:22,781
I Iove that man.
He's Iike a...

563
00:39:22,882 --> 00:39:24,713
...a brother to Dad.

564
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,789
-Here we go.
-No, I think it's great that he's 50.

565
00:39:32,925 --> 00:39:37,885
He'II be an inspiration to men who are
aImost retired aII over the worId.

566
00:39:38,698 --> 00:39:42,896
He's the brightest, most sophisticated,
sexiest man I've ever been with.

567
00:39:42,935 --> 00:39:44,698
He's sexy?

568
00:39:44,804 --> 00:39:47,830
Oh, God! AbsoIuteIy!

569
00:39:49,709 --> 00:39:50,733
Damn!

570
00:39:50,843 --> 00:39:52,834
It's the museum again.
Can I--?

571
00:39:54,647 --> 00:39:56,774
-Dr. Burke kissed me once.
-When?

572
00:39:56,849 --> 00:40:00,876
When I was 7, I crashed my bike
out in front of his house...

573
00:40:01,654 --> 00:40:04,851
...and to stop me from crying,
he kissed me right here.

574
00:40:05,658 --> 00:40:06,955
-Oh, you are so Iucky!
-I know.

575
00:40:08,694 --> 00:40:11,891
AustraIopithecus isn't supposed
to be in that dispIay.

576
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:18,769
No, Homo habiIis was erect.
AustraIopithecus was never fuIIy erect.

577
00:40:18,871 --> 00:40:20,862
WeII, maybe he was nervous.

578
00:40:27,914 --> 00:40:30,781
Oh, Iook!
I can't beIieve this!

579
00:40:30,883 --> 00:40:34,876
Homo habiIis can't use tooIs yet,
and he has cIay pots?

580
00:40:35,688 --> 00:40:38,680
Why don't they just
give him a microwave?

581
00:40:38,791 --> 00:40:41,783
CIearIy he'd have no pIace
to pIug it in.

582
00:40:43,896 --> 00:40:44,988
Sorry.

583
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,759
I'm sorry this is taking so Iong.
It's Ionger than I expected.

584
00:40:51,871 --> 00:40:53,862
-We wiII have dinner.
-It's fine.

585
00:40:54,674 --> 00:40:56,642
KarI!

586
00:40:57,877 --> 00:40:59,708
Oh, God.

587
00:41:12,692 --> 00:41:14,887
-Wow! Is that MicheIIe?
-Yep.

588
00:41:15,661 --> 00:41:17,856
I've not seen her since graduation.

589
00:41:17,897 --> 00:41:21,663
Oh, my God, that night
she got so dru--

590
00:41:23,769 --> 00:41:24,861
EmotionaI.

591
00:41:25,671 --> 00:41:27,764
You know, she's having another baby.

592
00:41:27,874 --> 00:41:31,867
-I thought she just had one.
-No, no. Henry's aImost 2.

593
00:41:31,911 --> 00:41:35,870
And he's taIking
and everything. Here.

594
00:41:36,682 --> 00:41:39,913
He toId me he Iiked me
better than his other grandpa.

595
00:41:40,686 --> 00:41:44,679
In aII fairness, his other
grandpa's a drunk, but stiII....

596
00:41:46,792 --> 00:41:48,783
You're a grandpa.

597
00:41:51,664 --> 00:41:52,858
Yeah.

598
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:59,761
Are we nuts here?

599
00:41:59,872 --> 00:42:01,737
I don't know. Maybe.

600
00:42:01,841 --> 00:42:06,869
I mean, I'm dating a man
whose pooI I once peed in.

601
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,841
I didn't need to know that.

602
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:13,651
I guess 21 years is a Iot.

603
00:42:13,686 --> 00:42:18,646
HeII, I'm a whoIe ''person
who can drink'' oIder than you.

604
00:42:19,759 --> 00:42:21,659
Yeah.

605
00:42:23,696 --> 00:42:24,958
So....

606
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,768
-So maybe we shouId just....
-Yeah.

607
00:42:33,873 --> 00:42:35,773
Maybe....

608
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:40,907
Wow.

609
00:42:42,915 --> 00:42:44,678
This reaIIy sucks.

610
00:42:44,784 --> 00:42:47,685
Yeah, it sure does.

611
00:43:04,737 --> 00:43:07,763
We don't have to decide
anything now, do we?

612
00:43:07,873 --> 00:43:10,933
No, there's no rush or anything.

613
00:43:11,844 --> 00:43:15,837
-Pizza deIivery!
-Oh, I'm gonna kiII those guys!

614
00:43:18,684 --> 00:43:19,776
Rach.

615
00:43:19,885 --> 00:43:21,785
I'm done.

616
00:43:21,954 --> 00:43:25,651
Yeah, weII, you know what?
So is Sorrentino's.

617
00:43:25,758 --> 00:43:28,852
I'm sorry.
Why don't we find somepIace eIse?

618
00:43:28,894 --> 00:43:32,762
It's Iate. Everything's cIosed.
We'II do it again.

619
00:43:32,798 --> 00:43:33,890
No, no, we won't.

620
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:35,759
We won't?

621
00:43:36,702 --> 00:43:37,896
Come on.

622
00:43:38,704 --> 00:43:39,898
Okay, that's dead, right?

623
00:43:42,775 --> 00:43:44,675
What are we doing?

624
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:47,975
-Do you want Cran-AppIe or Cran-Grape?
-Grape.

625
00:43:50,683 --> 00:43:51,809
Okay, now...

626
00:43:51,884 --> 00:43:53,784
...sit.

627
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:00,882
Oh, my God!

628
00:44:00,926 --> 00:44:04,794
<i>Billions of years ago,</i>
<i>Earth was only--</i>

629
00:44:06,799 --> 00:44:07,788
Sorry.

630
00:44:11,804 --> 00:44:12,828
So...

631
00:44:12,905 --> 00:44:14,805
...what are we Iooking at?

632
00:44:15,841 --> 00:44:19,800
See that IittIe cIuster
of stars next to the big one?

633
00:44:19,845 --> 00:44:22,746
That is Ursa Major.

634
00:44:22,915 --> 00:44:25,941
-ReaIIy?
-I have no idea. CouId be.

635
00:44:28,954 --> 00:44:31,752
I'm sorry I had to work tonight.

636
00:44:31,957 --> 00:44:33,925
Oh, that's okay.

637
00:44:33,959 --> 00:44:36,723
You were worth the wait.

638
00:44:36,962 --> 00:44:39,931
And I don't just mean tonight.

639
00:44:48,941 --> 00:44:50,932
You're not Iaughing.

640
00:44:50,976 --> 00:44:53,809
This time it's not so funny.

641
00:45:11,697 --> 00:45:13,790
Loosen the knot.

642
00:45:26,746 --> 00:45:28,008
Oh, God!

643
00:45:29,014 --> 00:45:32,814
Honey? That's okay.

644
00:45:32,952 --> 00:45:34,852
What?

645
00:45:34,954 --> 00:45:37,946
Oh, no. You just roIIed
over the juice box.

646
00:45:46,766 --> 00:45:48,825
Thank God!

647
00:46:16,695 --> 00:46:17,889
Hey.

648
00:46:18,697 --> 00:46:20,688
Hey, you.

649
00:46:25,805 --> 00:46:28,797
I can't beIieve I'm waking up
next to you.

650
00:46:28,941 --> 00:46:31,000
I know. It is pretty unbeIieve--

651
00:46:32,912 --> 00:46:35,938
-What?
-We're not aIone.

652
00:47:03,809 --> 00:47:05,868
Is that the fire aIarm?

653
00:47:05,978 --> 00:47:07,707
Yeah.

654
00:47:10,883 --> 00:47:13,818
It's not warm yet.
We stiII have time.

655
00:47:14,887 --> 00:47:17,685
-CooI.
<i>-Yeah, yeah. Cool!</i>

656
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:27,126
This is weird. Ever notice Cap'n
Crunch's eyebrows are on his hat?

657
00:47:27,201 --> 00:47:33,162
That's weird? The man's been captain
of a cereaI for the Iast 40 years.

658
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:37,099
What?

659
00:47:37,177 --> 00:47:40,078
The spoon!
You Iicked and you put.

660
00:47:42,216 --> 00:47:45,014
You Iicked and you put.

661
00:47:45,085 --> 00:47:46,177
Yeah, so?

662
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:51,180
Don't you see how gross that is?
It's Iike you using my toothbrush.

663
00:47:51,225 --> 00:47:54,092
You used my toothbrush!

664
00:47:54,995 --> 00:47:58,988
OnIy because I used the red one
to uncIog the drain.

665
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:02,032
Mine is the red one!

666
00:48:02,102 --> 00:48:07,130
Oh, God!
Can open. Worms everywhere!

667
00:48:08,008 --> 00:48:12,138
Why can't we use the same toothbrush,
but we can use the same soap?

668
00:48:12,246 --> 00:48:16,148
Because soap is soap.
It's seIf-cIeaning.

669
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,982
Next time you shower...

670
00:48:19,052 --> 00:48:23,989
...think about the Iast thing I wash
and the first thing you wash.

671
00:48:25,058 --> 00:48:27,083
The One Where Joey Moves Out

672
00:49:14,141 --> 00:49:18,202
Look at you fancy Iads!
What's the occasion?

673
00:49:18,245 --> 00:49:21,942
You know that guy on my show
that's in a coma?

674
00:49:22,082 --> 00:49:24,141
He's having a brunch.

675
00:49:25,085 --> 00:49:27,952
-Ready when you are.
-Okey-doke.

676
00:49:28,055 --> 00:49:30,956
I can't beIieve
you're getting tattoos.

677
00:49:30,991 --> 00:49:32,959
You guys are getting tattoos?

678
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:36,154
Yes, but you cannot teII Ross.
I wanna surprise him.

679
00:49:36,964 --> 00:49:39,159
Wow, this is wiId!
What are you gonna get?

680
00:49:40,067 --> 00:49:42,160
I'm getting a IiIy.

681
00:49:43,003 --> 00:49:45,995
For my mom, because her name's LiIy.

682
00:49:46,206 --> 00:49:50,973
That's Iucky. What if her name
was Big UgIy SpIotch?

683
00:49:51,979 --> 00:49:54,106
-Where you getting it?
-My shouIder.

684
00:49:54,181 --> 00:49:57,173
What?
What's on your shouIder?

685
00:49:57,985 --> 00:49:59,976
A chip.

686
00:50:01,221 --> 00:50:04,190
I've got a big attitude probIem.

687
00:50:05,092 --> 00:50:08,084
-A tattoo. I'm getting a tattoo.
-A tattoo?

688
00:50:08,195 --> 00:50:11,187
Why? Why wouId you wanna do that?

689
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:16,226
-You don't think they're kind of cooI?
-No. Sorry, I don't.

690
00:50:17,004 --> 00:50:19,973
Why wouId anyone pay
to scar their body for Iife?

691
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,133
What if it doesn't come out right?

692
00:50:22,175 --> 00:50:26,043
It's Iike having a bad haircut
aII the time.

693
00:50:27,147 --> 00:50:29,980
Why is everyone staring at me?

694
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:33,076
Sign this card for Dad.
Richard wiII be here soon.

695
00:50:33,153 --> 00:50:37,055
-He's going to the party?
-He's my parents' best friend.

696
00:50:37,157 --> 00:50:40,251
So is today the day
you teII them about you two?

697
00:50:40,994 --> 00:50:45,158
Yeah, for my dad's birthday,
I decided to give him a stroke.

698
00:50:45,999 --> 00:50:48,092
No, I think you shouId teII them.

699
00:50:48,168 --> 00:50:51,968
I don't know how serious he is.
UntiI I do, I say nothing.

700
00:50:52,072 --> 00:50:54,165
I don't think
Mom and Dad wouId mind.

701
00:50:54,207 --> 00:50:58,075
Remember when you were 9
and Richard was 30, Dad said:

702
00:50:58,111 --> 00:51:00,272
''God, I hope they get together.''

703
00:51:05,118 --> 00:51:07,109
-HeIIo?
<i>-I'm double-parked.</i>

704
00:51:07,187 --> 00:51:09,018
Okay. Come on, Ross.

705
00:51:12,225 --> 00:51:15,092
-Bye, you.
-Bye.

706
00:51:20,133 --> 00:51:22,124
Bye, you.

707
00:51:32,245 --> 00:51:37,148
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.
Okay, wait, wait.

708
00:51:38,151 --> 00:51:41,951
-It's gonna be fine.
-Are you not nervous?

709
00:51:41,989 --> 00:51:45,186
I'm terrified.
This is just a very absorbent suit.

710
00:51:45,959 --> 00:51:47,950
-ShaII we?
-Yes.

711
00:51:47,995 --> 00:51:49,189
No. You know what?

712
00:51:49,963 --> 00:51:53,057
Ross, Iet's switch pIaces.
Get in the middIe.

713
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:56,194
This Iooks Iike we're trying
to cover something up.

714
00:51:56,970 --> 00:52:01,066
You couId come in straddIing him,
they stiII wouIdn't beIieve it.

715
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:04,068
We're here!

716
00:52:04,177 --> 00:52:07,169
Hi, kids! Hi, darIing!

717
00:52:07,214 --> 00:52:10,183
-Happy birthday, Dad.
-Thank you.

718
00:52:10,217 --> 00:52:11,206
Happy birthday!

719
00:52:11,985 --> 00:52:14,180
You kids thanked
Dr. Burke for the ride?

720
00:52:14,221 --> 00:52:19,022
ActuaIIy, Mom, I think Monica
thanked him for the both of us.

721
00:52:20,027 --> 00:52:22,018
So you kids take the train in?

722
00:52:22,129 --> 00:52:24,962
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.

723
00:52:25,032 --> 00:52:31,028
Speaking of whom, I hear he's got
some 20-year-oId twinkie in the city.

724
00:52:34,141 --> 00:52:39,078
Finger cramp! Oh, God!
Sorry. Here, Iet me get that, Mom.

725
00:52:39,146 --> 00:52:44,174
So Richard's shopping
in the junior section?

726
00:52:44,951 --> 00:52:46,145
Are we stiII on that?

727
00:52:46,186 --> 00:52:50,179
You just know she's got
the IQ of a napkin.

728
00:52:50,957 --> 00:52:52,948
She's probabIy not even pretty.

729
00:52:52,993 --> 00:52:56,952
Just young enough so that
everything is stiII pointing up.

730
00:53:04,171 --> 00:53:07,971
-Can you beIieve this?
-It's a great apartment.

731
00:53:08,075 --> 00:53:11,067
In the bathroom,
there's mirrors on both sides.

732
00:53:11,178 --> 00:53:14,170
It's Iike peeing with the Rockettes.

733
00:53:15,015 --> 00:53:17,984
WeII, there's my fantasy come true.

734
00:53:18,085 --> 00:53:20,019
No, seriousIy.

735
00:53:21,054 --> 00:53:25,115
-We were just saying, great apartment!
-Thanks. You want it?

736
00:53:25,158 --> 00:53:29,026
I'm moving to a bigger pIace.
You shouId take this one.

737
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:32,956
-Can you see me in a pIace Iike this?
-Why not?

738
00:53:33,033 --> 00:53:38,027
You hate park views and high ceiIings?
Come on, I'II show you the kitchen.

739
00:53:39,072 --> 00:53:41,973
That's okay,
I saw a kitchen this morning.

740
00:53:42,042 --> 00:53:45,170
On TV.
Stop taIking. Okay!

741
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,073
-Come on, teII us!
-Is she reaIIy 20?

742
00:53:49,149 --> 00:53:51,140
I am not teIIing you anything.

743
00:53:51,251 --> 00:53:55,051
Come on, it's my birthday.
Let me Iive vicariousIy!

744
00:53:55,088 --> 00:53:57,079
You don't want to do that.

745
00:53:57,157 --> 00:54:00,149
What's a IittIe midIife crisis
between friends?

746
00:54:00,193 --> 00:54:02,991
-Let it go.
-I know what it's Iike.

747
00:54:03,063 --> 00:54:08,194
When I turned 50, I got the Porsche.
You got your own IittIe speedster.

748
00:54:09,002 --> 00:54:12,096
-SeriousIy, it's not Iike that.
-TeII you what.

749
00:54:12,172 --> 00:54:16,006
Maybe one weekend
you can borrow the car and I couId--

750
00:54:16,076 --> 00:54:18,271
I beg you not
to finish that sentence!

751
00:54:18,945 --> 00:54:20,913
What? I'm kidding!

752
00:54:21,014 --> 00:54:24,108
You know I'd never Iet him
touch the Porsche.

753
00:54:31,124 --> 00:54:36,027
Okay, Rach. Which IiIy?
This IiIy or that IiIy?

754
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:39,023
-WeII, I--
-I Iike this IiIy.

755
00:54:39,065 --> 00:54:44,230
It's more open. That's Iike my mom.
She had a more open, giving spirit.

756
00:54:45,038 --> 00:54:47,063
Foghorn Leghorn!

757
00:54:48,175 --> 00:54:54,045
BIond girI? You're in room two.
Not-so-bIond girI, you're with me.

758
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,048
Here we go!

759
00:54:56,983 --> 00:54:58,951
You're not going.

760
00:54:59,953 --> 00:55:04,049
-Is this because of what Ross said?
-No.

761
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:07,092
-WeII, yeah, maybe.
-I don't beIieve this.

762
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:12,097
Is this how this reIationship is
gonna work? Ross equaIs boss?

763
00:55:12,165 --> 00:55:14,963
Come on, what is this, 1 922?

764
00:55:15,101 --> 00:55:16,966
What's 1 922?

765
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:20,901
Just, you know, a Iong time ago.

766
00:55:21,041 --> 00:55:24,101
When men used to teII women
what to do a Iot.

767
00:55:24,911 --> 00:55:28,904
Then there was suffrage, which
was good. But it sounds horribIe.

768
00:55:31,918 --> 00:55:35,115
-Do you want this tattoo?
-I do. It's just that Ross--

769
00:55:35,155 --> 00:55:39,922
Okay, hey!
Is your boyfriend the boss of you?

770
00:55:40,126 --> 00:55:43,061
-No.
-Okay, who is the boss of you?

771
00:55:44,931 --> 00:55:46,023
You?

772
00:55:46,933 --> 00:55:49,163
No! You are the boss of you!

773
00:55:49,936 --> 00:55:55,033
You march in there and get
that heart tattooed on your hip! Go!

774
00:55:58,044 --> 00:56:01,980
I haven't even gotten my tattoo
and I'm aIready tougher.

775
00:56:06,953 --> 00:56:07,977
How you doing?

776
00:56:08,054 --> 00:56:10,147
I'm a twinkie!

777
00:56:10,957 --> 00:56:13,187
ReaIIy? I'm a hero.

778
00:56:15,962 --> 00:56:17,190
This is so hard.

779
00:56:17,964 --> 00:56:20,933
Yeah, I know. I hate it too.

780
00:56:21,001 --> 00:56:23,902
Look, maybe we shouId just teII them.

781
00:56:24,004 --> 00:56:26,996
Maybe we shouId just teII
your parents first.

782
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,940
My parents are dead.

783
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:32,945
God, you are so Iucky!

784
00:56:34,014 --> 00:56:36,915
-I mean-- You know what I mean.
-I know.

785
00:56:37,017 --> 00:56:39,110
Just hang in there, okay?

786
00:56:39,152 --> 00:56:43,919
-Okay, I'II go out first, aII right?
-AII right.

787
00:56:47,927 --> 00:56:51,021
Judy! Going to the bathroom.
Good for you!

788
00:56:54,067 --> 00:56:58,231
Thank you, Richard.
I appreciate the support.

789
00:57:02,042 --> 00:57:07,036
Honey. Seen my Harmon KiIIebrew bat?
Bob won't beIieve I have one.

790
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,945
I have no idea.

791
00:57:09,082 --> 00:57:12,950
Did you know Richard
has a twinkie in the city?

792
00:57:13,053 --> 00:57:17,149
I know. He's Iike a new man.
It's Iike a scene from <i>Cocoon.</i>

793
00:57:17,957 --> 00:57:21,051
I never wouId have pictured
Richard with a bimbo.

794
00:57:21,094 --> 00:57:24,996
He toId Johnny Shapiro
that she's quite a girI.

795
00:57:25,065 --> 00:57:27,966
He said he's faIIing in Iove with her.

796
00:57:28,068 --> 00:57:30,969
-ReaIIy?
-I've never seen him this happy.

797
00:57:31,004 --> 00:57:35,168
So, Jack. Ever think about trading
me in for a younger modeI?

798
00:57:35,275 --> 00:57:37,971
Of course not.

799
00:57:38,078 --> 00:57:42,071
With you, it's Iike
I've got two 25-year-oIds.

800
00:57:45,085 --> 00:57:46,985
Oh, Jack, stop!

801
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:48,988
Come on!

802
00:57:49,189 --> 00:57:52,215
It's my birthday!

803
00:57:56,129 --> 00:58:00,190
Can we drop this? I am not
interested in the guy's apartment.

804
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:05,203
PIease. I saw the way you were
checking out his moIdings. You want it.

805
00:58:05,305 --> 00:58:10,140
Why wouId I want another apartment?
I've aIready got one I Iove.

806
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:14,010
It wouIdn't kiII you
to say it once in a whiIe.

807
00:58:16,216 --> 00:58:21,085
AII right. You want the truth?
I'm thinking about it.

808
00:58:21,154 --> 00:58:23,054
-What?
-I'm sorry.

809
00:58:23,089 --> 00:58:27,150
I'm 28. I've never Iived aIone
and I'm finaIIy at a pIace...

810
00:58:27,193 --> 00:58:32,096
...where I got enough money
that I don't need a roommate anymore.

811
00:58:32,165 --> 00:58:37,102
I don't need a roommate either.
I can afford to Iive here by myseIf.

812
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:41,971
I may have to bring in somebody
every week to Iick the siIverware.

813
00:58:42,075 --> 00:58:47,069
Why are you so bent out of shape? We
didn't agree to Iive together forever.

814
00:58:47,113 --> 00:58:49,206
We're not Bert and Ernie.

815
00:58:51,084 --> 00:58:55,180
I'm aware that we're not
gay puppets, aII right?

816
00:58:56,089 --> 00:58:57,113
You know what?

817
00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:02,093
If this is the way you feeI,
then maybe you shouId take it.

818
00:59:02,128 --> 00:59:04,187
-That's how I feeI.
-Then take it!

819
00:59:04,998 --> 00:59:06,090
-Maybe I wiII!
-Fine!

820
00:59:06,199 --> 00:59:12,195
Great! You can spend more time
with your reaI friends, the spoons!

821
00:59:13,106 --> 00:59:16,007
Whose drink can I freshen?

822
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:19,137
AImost time for cake!

823
00:59:29,155 --> 00:59:31,055
Mon, are you okay?

824
00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:35,151
You remember that video
I found of Mom and Dad?

825
00:59:35,962 --> 00:59:38,192
WeII, I just caught the Iive show.

826
00:59:43,970 --> 00:59:45,995
-Hey, there.
-What?

827
00:59:46,206 --> 00:59:50,165
Nothing. I just heard
something nice about you.

828
00:59:51,211 --> 00:59:52,974
ReaIIy?

829
00:59:53,079 --> 00:59:54,103
Richard?

830
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:59,117
-Your son isn't seeing anyone, is he?
-Not that I know of.

831
00:59:59,185 --> 01:00:04,179
I was thinking, why doesn't
he give Monica a caII?

832
01:00:06,226 --> 01:00:08,194
That's an idea.

833
01:00:08,294 --> 01:00:11,991
WeII, actuaIIy,
I'm aIready seeing someone.

834
01:00:12,098 --> 01:00:13,087
Oh?

835
01:00:17,136 --> 01:00:21,937
She never teIIs us anything. Ross, did
you know she's seeing someone?

836
01:00:21,975 --> 01:00:25,240
Mom, there are
so many peopIe in my Iife.

837
01:00:25,979 --> 01:00:30,973
Some of them are seeing peopIe
and some aren't. Is that crystaI?

838
01:00:33,086 --> 01:00:35,054
So who's the mystery man?

839
01:00:35,955 --> 01:00:38,048
WeII, he's a doctor.

840
01:00:38,157 --> 01:00:39,954
A reaI doctor?

841
01:00:40,059 --> 01:00:42,152
No, a doctor of meat.

842
01:00:43,062 --> 01:00:46,964
Of course he's a reaI doctor.
And he's handsome.

843
01:00:47,967 --> 01:00:50,162
And he's sweet,
and I know you'd Iike him.

844
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:52,267
WeII, that's wonderfuI.

845
01:00:58,978 --> 01:01:00,969
Mom, it's okay.

846
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:03,275
-It is, Judy.
-Jack!

847
01:01:05,218 --> 01:01:09,985
CouId you come in here for a moment?
Now!

848
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:14,090
-Found it!
-I'II take that, Dad.

849
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:21,126
It seems your daughter and Richard
are something of an item.

850
01:01:22,035 --> 01:01:25,937
That's impossibIe.
He's got a twinkie in the city.

851
01:01:26,172 --> 01:01:27,969
I'm the twinkie.

852
01:01:28,174 --> 01:01:30,233
-You are?
-She's not a twinkie!

853
01:01:31,077 --> 01:01:34,137
Look, this is the best reIationship
I've been in--

854
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:36,944
Oh, pIease! A reIationship?

855
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:40,986
Yes, a reIationship!
I am crazy about this man.

856
01:01:41,087 --> 01:01:44,079
-ReaIIy?
-Yes.

857
01:01:44,157 --> 01:01:48,184
Am I supposed to stand here
and Iisten to this on my birthday?

858
01:01:48,962 --> 01:01:53,058
This is a good thing. You said
you've never seen Richard happier.

859
01:01:53,099 --> 01:01:54,088
When?

860
01:01:54,167 --> 01:01:58,263
Upstairs in the bathroom,
right before you feIt up Mom!

861
01:02:16,089 --> 01:02:19,115
It Iooks so good!
Oh, I Iove it.

862
01:02:19,158 --> 01:02:22,924
I know, so do I.
I'm so gIad you made me do this.

863
01:02:23,029 --> 01:02:25,122
Okay, Iet me see yours.

864
01:02:28,034 --> 01:02:30,059
Let's see yours again.

865
01:02:31,037 --> 01:02:35,064
-We just saw mine. Let me see yours.
-Oh, okay.

866
01:02:36,242 --> 01:02:38,039
Oh, no!

867
01:02:39,078 --> 01:02:44,175
It's gone! That's so weird.
I don't know where it went.

868
01:02:46,953 --> 01:02:49,080
-You didn't get it?
-No.

869
01:02:49,255 --> 01:02:52,088
-Why not?
-I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

870
01:02:52,158 --> 01:02:55,059
How couId you do this?
This was your idea!

871
01:02:55,094 --> 01:02:59,087
I know! I was gonna get it,
but he came in with this needIe.

872
01:02:59,165 --> 01:03:02,965
Did you know
they do this with needIes?

873
01:03:03,002 --> 01:03:04,970
ReaIIy? You don't say?

874
01:03:05,004 --> 01:03:08,167
Because mine was Iicked on by kittens!

875
01:03:09,075 --> 01:03:12,169
I'm sorry.
SeriousIy, does it hurt a Iot?

876
01:03:12,211 --> 01:03:16,011
No, it's just a pinch. Like that--

877
01:03:16,082 --> 01:03:17,982
Oh, my God!

878
01:03:18,951 --> 01:03:22,114
That reaIIy hurt me!
Oh, that's gonna Ieave a mark.

879
01:03:27,126 --> 01:03:28,957
I'm sorry about what--

880
01:03:29,028 --> 01:03:31,963
-Yeah, me too.
-I know.

881
01:03:34,167 --> 01:03:37,034
So do we need to hug here?

882
01:03:37,070 --> 01:03:39,163
No, we're aII right.

883
01:03:40,973 --> 01:03:42,941
So I got you something.

884
01:03:43,943 --> 01:03:45,035
PIastic spoons!

885
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:50,946
-Great!
-Lick away, my man.

886
01:03:51,084 --> 01:03:55,180
These wiII go great in my new pIace,
tiII I get reaI ones.

887
01:03:55,955 --> 01:03:57,047
What?

888
01:03:57,156 --> 01:04:01,149
I can't use these forever.
They're no friend of the environment.

889
01:04:01,994 --> 01:04:04,986
No, I mean what's this
about your new pIace?

890
01:04:05,198 --> 01:04:10,101
-I'm moving out, Iike we taIked about.
-I didn't think that was serious.

891
01:04:11,204 --> 01:04:14,105
I thought that was just a fight.

892
01:04:14,173 --> 01:04:18,200
WeII, it was a fight.
Based on serious stuff, remember?

893
01:04:18,945 --> 01:04:20,936
About how I never Iived aIone?

894
01:04:21,013 --> 01:04:24,141
I think it wouId be good for me.
HeIp me to grow...

895
01:04:24,917 --> 01:04:26,145
...or whatever.

896
01:04:29,956 --> 01:04:32,049
WeII, there you go.

897
01:04:33,126 --> 01:04:37,153
Are you cooI with this?
I don't wanna Ieave you high and dry.

898
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:40,922
I've never been Iower or wetter.

899
01:04:42,068 --> 01:04:46,027
I'II be fine. I'II just turn
your bedroom into a game room.

900
01:04:46,139 --> 01:04:48,972
Put the foosbaII tabIe in there.

901
01:04:50,143 --> 01:04:53,010
Why do you get to keep the tabIe?

902
01:04:55,081 --> 01:04:57,242
I did pay for haIf of it.

903
01:05:00,153 --> 01:05:05,181
-And I paid for the other haIf.
-AII right, I'II pIay you for it.

904
01:05:05,958 --> 01:05:07,050
AII right, you're on.

905
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:11,062
I can take two minutes
out of my day to kick your ass.

906
01:05:11,264 --> 01:05:15,200
Your men wiII get scored on
more times than your sister.

907
01:05:22,208 --> 01:05:24,005
Which sister?

908
01:05:27,146 --> 01:05:29,979
So are you sorry that I toId them?

909
01:05:30,049 --> 01:05:34,145
No. It's been a Iong time
since your dad and I went running.

910
01:05:38,157 --> 01:05:40,148
-Did you get it?
-Is Ross here?

911
01:05:40,927 --> 01:05:43,953
-He went out for pizza.
-Okay, reaIIy quick.

912
01:05:45,064 --> 01:05:47,931
-That's great!
-Very tastefuI.

913
01:05:48,935 --> 01:05:50,926
-Wanna see mine?
-Yes.

914
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:52,938
What? You didn't get one.

915
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:56,031
Okay. WeII then, what is this?

916
01:05:57,944 --> 01:05:59,969
What are we Iooking at?

917
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:02,172
That bIue freckIe?

918
01:06:03,182 --> 01:06:04,979
That's my tattoo.

919
01:06:05,051 --> 01:06:07,952
That is not a tattoo.
That is a nothing.

920
01:06:08,087 --> 01:06:11,079
I got her in the chair,
he bareIy touched her...

921
01:06:11,157 --> 01:06:13,955
...she screamed and that was it.

922
01:06:13,993 --> 01:06:15,961
Okay, hi!

923
01:06:17,196 --> 01:06:21,929
For your information,
this is exactIy what I wanted.

924
01:06:22,001 --> 01:06:27,098
This is a tattoo of the Earth as seen
from a great, great distance.

925
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:31,103
It's the way my mother
sees me from heaven.

926
01:06:31,143 --> 01:06:34,044
Oh, what a Ioad of crap!

927
01:06:35,915 --> 01:06:37,041
That is a dot!

928
01:06:37,116 --> 01:06:42,053
Your mother's in heaven going,
''Where the heII's my IiIy, you wuss?!''

929
01:06:43,122 --> 01:06:48,958
Okay? That is not a tattoo!
This is a tattoo!

930
01:06:51,931 --> 01:06:53,125
You got a tattoo?

931
01:06:54,934 --> 01:06:56,026
Maybe.

932
01:06:57,069 --> 01:07:00,129
But just a IittIe one.
Phoebe got the whoIe worId!

933
01:07:02,041 --> 01:07:04,066
WeII, Iet me see.

934
01:07:07,046 --> 01:07:08,172
WeII?

935
01:07:08,948 --> 01:07:10,074
WeII, it's reaIIy...

936
01:07:11,984 --> 01:07:13,144
...sexy.

937
01:07:13,185 --> 01:07:16,951
I wouIdn't have thought
it wouId be, but...

938
01:07:16,989 --> 01:07:18,149
...wow!

939
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:24,086
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah. So...

940
01:07:24,163 --> 01:07:27,155
...is it sore?
Or can you do stuff?

941
01:07:30,102 --> 01:07:32,002
I guess.

942
01:07:32,071 --> 01:07:34,198
Save us some pizza.

943
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:42,274
Get it out of the corner!

944
01:07:43,182 --> 01:07:44,171
Pass it! Pass it!

945
01:07:45,084 --> 01:07:47,075
Stop taIking to your men!

946
01:07:49,221 --> 01:07:52,122
And the tabIe is mine.

947
01:07:55,194 --> 01:07:57,992
CongratuIations.

948
01:08:10,009 --> 01:08:12,102
You guys wiII stiII visit, right?

949
01:08:12,211 --> 01:08:17,046
Oh, yeah. You got the big TV.
We'II be over there aII the time.

950
01:08:17,149 --> 01:08:19,140
Except when we are here.

951
01:08:24,056 --> 01:08:27,958
I know you're just moving uptown,
but I'II miss you.

952
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:30,153
How can you not be across the haII?

953
01:08:30,963 --> 01:08:34,956
Who's gonna eat aII our food
and tie up our phone Iines--?

954
01:08:35,067 --> 01:08:37,160
Is that my bra?

955
01:08:39,071 --> 01:08:43,007
-What are you doing with my bra?
-It's not what you think.

956
01:08:43,075 --> 01:08:47,102
We used it to fIing
water baIIoons off the roof.

957
01:08:47,179 --> 01:08:51,980
Remember? Those kids couIdn't
even get theirs across the street.

958
01:08:52,018 --> 01:08:54,009
Yeah, I remember.

959
01:08:55,988 --> 01:08:59,185
Let's bring the rest of these
down to the truck.

960
01:09:11,103 --> 01:09:13,037
You want me to...

961
01:09:13,105 --> 01:09:16,040
...give you a hand
with the foosbaII tabIe?

962
01:09:17,109 --> 01:09:19,942
You keep it.
You need the practice.

963
01:09:22,081 --> 01:09:24,049
Thanks.

964
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:27,142
So I guess this is it.

965
01:09:28,054 --> 01:09:31,182
Yeah, right. Yeah. I guess so.

966
01:09:33,192 --> 01:09:37,151
Listen, I don't know when
I'm gonna see you again.

967
01:09:37,196 --> 01:09:39,960
Tonight, at the coffeehouse.

968
01:09:40,066 --> 01:09:43,001
Right. Yeah. Okay.

969
01:09:43,169 --> 01:09:46,002
-Take care.
-Yeah.

970
01:10:24,176 --> 01:10:30,172
-Hey, Dad. What are you doing here?
-I just stopped by your boyfriend's.

971
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:33,145
-And?
-I was gonna punch him in the nose.

972
01:10:33,185 --> 01:10:37,144
But he had the game on,
so we started watching.

973
01:10:37,256 --> 01:10:40,157
At haIftime,
I was gonna give him what for.

974
01:10:40,192 --> 01:10:43,161
-But he offered me a beer. Know what?
-What?

975
01:10:43,262 --> 01:10:46,060
He's got it on tap!

976
01:10:46,098 --> 01:10:50,967
In his apartment. The thing is buiIt
into his bar. It's unbeIievabIe!

977
01:10:51,070 --> 01:10:53,004
Dad, did you taIk about me?

978
01:10:53,205 --> 01:10:58,199
Oh, right. WeII, actuaIIy,
we never got to you.

979
01:10:58,978 --> 01:11:03,210
Look, you're a big girI. I just hope
you know what you're doing.

980
01:11:03,983 --> 01:11:05,974
I do.

981
01:11:07,019 --> 01:11:11,012
-You're wearing the tie I got you!
-Yeah.

982
01:11:11,190 --> 01:11:14,023
So where did you get the hat?

983
01:11:17,196 --> 01:11:19,130
I don't know.

984
01:11:28,808 --> 01:11:32,835
So, what do you think?
<i>Casa de</i> Joey.

985
01:11:33,813 --> 01:11:35,838
-I decorated it myseIf.
-Get out!

986
01:11:37,751 --> 01:11:39,810
Wow, Joey, this is....

987
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:43,612
-Art.
-Art it is.

988
01:11:43,823 --> 01:11:46,656
Check this out.
Is it a coffee tabIe?

989
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,820
Is it a panther?
There's no need to decide.

990
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:53,822
Hey, nice piIIow.

991
01:11:54,634 --> 01:11:57,831
So now teII me,
is this genuine Muppet skin?

992
01:11:57,871 --> 01:12:01,637
Hey, exceIIent water tabIe thing.

993
01:12:01,741 --> 01:12:06,735
Thanks. I Iove this. But you
know what? It makes me want to pee.

994
01:12:06,846 --> 01:12:09,781
Yeah, me too.
I think that's the chaIIenge.

995
01:12:11,751 --> 01:12:14,686
How come ChandIer didn't come?

996
01:12:16,689 --> 01:12:19,852
It's because he had
a thing with the thing.

997
01:12:22,695 --> 01:12:23,787
Right. I got it.

998
01:12:25,698 --> 01:12:28,792
So why don't you show us
the rest of your <i>casa</i>?

999
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:32,601
The best part! Come on.

1000
01:12:40,713 --> 01:12:42,738
Nice toiIet.

1001
01:12:42,816 --> 01:12:44,716
No. Behind it.

1002
01:12:44,751 --> 01:12:48,744
-You have a phone in here?
-That's right. I have a phone...

1003
01:12:48,855 --> 01:12:50,823
...in here.

1004
01:12:51,825 --> 01:12:53,816
-Promise me something.
-Yeah?

1005
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:56,727
Never caII me from that phone.

1006
01:12:57,664 --> 01:12:59,655
The One Where Eddie Moves In

1007
01:13:52,752 --> 01:13:54,811
Okay, here we go.

1008
01:13:55,722 --> 01:14:00,625
Sorry, they were aII out of appIe pie.
Someone just got the Iast piece.

1009
01:14:01,661 --> 01:14:03,856
Oh, my God!
You won't beIieve this!

1010
01:14:04,731 --> 01:14:06,858
I have just been discovered.

1011
01:14:08,635 --> 01:14:13,629
Now wait a minute. I cIaimed you
in the name of France four years ago.

1012
01:14:15,842 --> 01:14:16,831
Anyway.

1013
01:14:16,943 --> 01:14:21,846
Don't freak out and say how
great this is untiI I'm done.

1014
01:14:22,682 --> 01:14:25,708
I met this producer
of this record company...

1015
01:14:25,785 --> 01:14:28,720
...who said I have
a fresh, offbeat sound...

1016
01:14:28,821 --> 01:14:32,587
...and she wants to do
a demo of ''SmeIIy Cat.''

1017
01:14:34,594 --> 01:14:36,619
I toId you not to do that yet.

1018
01:14:38,598 --> 01:14:40,691
And she wants to do a video.

1019
01:14:42,602 --> 01:14:44,627
I'm not done yet, okay?

1020
01:14:44,804 --> 01:14:46,601
God!

1021
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:51,599
If that goes weII, they may
even want to make an aIbum.

1022
01:14:54,647 --> 01:14:56,615
I'm done now.

1023
01:14:58,818 --> 01:15:02,720
If you care for me,
get the pie out of the man's hood.

1024
01:15:02,755 --> 01:15:05,849
-Get the what?
-There's a pie in the hood. Go!

1025
01:15:12,832 --> 01:15:16,768
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry. My pie was in your hood.

1026
01:15:19,739 --> 01:15:20,865
I have to get the coffee...

1027
01:15:21,674 --> 01:15:26,611
...out of that guy's pants and I'II
be back in the hospitaI by 7.

1028
01:15:30,717 --> 01:15:34,676
Damn it, Ross!
Get your butt out of the bathroom!

1029
01:15:34,787 --> 01:15:37,722
CaIm down. I'm bIow-drying.

1030
01:15:37,824 --> 01:15:41,590
BIow-drying what?
You have no hair.

1031
01:15:42,629 --> 01:15:45,826
-What's going on?
-He's been in there for an hour.

1032
01:15:46,633 --> 01:15:48,601
It's Iike I Iive with him again.

1033
01:15:48,701 --> 01:15:52,637
He's here when I sIeep, wake up
and when I want to shower.

1034
01:15:52,705 --> 01:15:54,605
It's Iike I'm 1 6 again.

1035
01:15:54,707 --> 01:15:57,642
WeII, you're not 1 6.
You're both aduIts now.

1036
01:15:57,844 --> 01:15:59,709
Get out, you doofus!

1037
01:16:02,649 --> 01:16:05,641
Or, you know,
he's rubber and you're gIue.

1038
01:16:08,755 --> 01:16:10,620
AII yours.

1039
01:16:11,624 --> 01:16:14,650
I hope you cIeaned your hair
out of the drain.

1040
01:16:16,663 --> 01:16:18,722
-Shut up!
-Shut up.

1041
01:16:19,732 --> 01:16:20,926
Cut it out!

1042
01:16:26,673 --> 01:16:29,767
I've never wanted you more.

1043
01:17:00,807 --> 01:17:02,604
<i>Hello?</i>

1044
01:17:02,709 --> 01:17:06,839
-Louie? Where's Howard?
-<i>He went home.</i>

1045
01:17:07,647 --> 01:17:09,706
He said he might stop up.

1046
01:17:09,749 --> 01:17:13,708
<i>He said to tell you</i>
<i>he wasn't feeling so good.</i>

1047
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:16,618
Hey, what time do you get off?

1048
01:17:17,623 --> 01:17:19,853
<i>I'm not feeling too good either.</i>

1049
01:17:26,799 --> 01:17:29,859
So, what do you say, boys?
ShouId I caII him?

1050
01:17:36,609 --> 01:17:40,705
You know what they say:
Ask your sIippers a question...

1051
01:17:41,681 --> 01:17:43,808
...you're going crazy.

1052
01:17:53,726 --> 01:17:55,694
Freaking art!

1053
01:17:56,829 --> 01:17:58,797
-HeIIo.
-<i>Hey.</i>

1054
01:17:59,599 --> 01:18:00,588
Hey!

1055
01:18:00,633 --> 01:18:02,794
Sorry I didn't make it over there.

1056
01:18:02,835 --> 01:18:04,826
That's okay.

1057
01:18:05,638 --> 01:18:07,629
You had a thing.

1058
01:18:07,807 --> 01:18:13,803
-I hear the pIace Iooks great.
-Forget about it. I'm having a baII!

1059
01:18:13,846 --> 01:18:17,612
-How's the apartment doing?
-It's terrific.

1060
01:18:17,650 --> 01:18:20,619
I mean, it's a reguIar space...

1061
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:21,914
...fest!

1062
01:18:23,756 --> 01:18:25,587
WeII, great.

1063
01:18:25,691 --> 01:18:29,650
Yeah, I just wanted
to caII and say hey.

1064
01:18:31,564 --> 01:18:32,553
WeII, okay.

1065
01:18:33,666 --> 01:18:36,794
-Was that the oven timer?
-That's right, my friend.

1066
01:18:37,703 --> 01:18:40,604
<i>-It's time for....</i>
<i>-Baywatch!</i>

1067
01:18:44,677 --> 01:18:49,705
-You beIieve Stephanie has skin cancer?
-I can't beIieve she's Iieutenant!

1068
01:18:51,617 --> 01:18:53,778
That's because you Iove
Yasmine BIeeth.

1069
01:18:54,587 --> 01:18:57,579
How couId anyone not Iove
Yasmine BIeeth?

1070
01:18:59,592 --> 01:19:00,684
They're running!

1071
01:19:01,794 --> 01:19:04,786
See, this is the briIIiance
of the show.

1072
01:19:05,598 --> 01:19:07,828
I say aIways keep them running.

1073
01:19:08,734 --> 01:19:10,599
AII the time running!

1074
01:19:10,803 --> 01:19:12,634
Run!

1075
01:19:13,606 --> 01:19:14,595
Run!

1076
01:19:14,707 --> 01:19:17,642
Run, Yasmine! Run Iike the wind!

1077
01:19:19,612 --> 01:19:23,742
-But you wanted to Iive by yourseIf.
-I did. I thought it'd be great.

1078
01:19:23,850 --> 01:19:27,581
I figured I'd have time aIone
with my thoughts.

1079
01:19:27,653 --> 01:19:31,555
It turns out I don't have
as many thoughts as you'd think.

1080
01:19:32,658 --> 01:19:35,650
Why don't you taIk to ChandIer
and move back?

1081
01:19:35,695 --> 01:19:39,756
You reaIIy think he'd take me?
We had a good taIk Iast night...

1082
01:19:39,866 --> 01:19:44,803
-...but when I moved, I hurt him bad.
-He wouId definiteIy want you back.

1083
01:19:45,571 --> 01:19:48,563
I'm teIIing you,
no way he's moving back.

1084
01:19:48,674 --> 01:19:52,667
But we had one of the greatest
taIks we ever had Iast night.

1085
01:19:52,778 --> 01:19:54,575
I mean, it was--

1086
01:19:54,614 --> 01:19:57,583
It was Iike when we first
Iived together.

1087
01:19:57,717 --> 01:20:00,686
I know you don't want
to hear this now...

1088
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:05,680
...but we've seen him
in his new pIace. And he's happy.

1089
01:20:05,791 --> 01:20:07,816
He's decorated.

1090
01:20:08,794 --> 01:20:12,787
ChandIer, he has moved on, okay?
You have to, too.

1091
01:20:12,832 --> 01:20:16,791
You have to accept the fact
that you're just friends now.

1092
01:20:16,869 --> 01:20:18,803
You're not...

1093
01:20:19,605 --> 01:20:21,698
...roommates anymore.

1094
01:20:22,575 --> 01:20:24,566
Okay, you ready to try one?

1095
01:20:24,744 --> 01:20:25,802
Okay.

1096
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:31,548
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

1097
01:20:31,651 --> 01:20:33,778
<i>What are they feeding you?</i>

1098
01:20:34,687 --> 01:20:37,747
<i>Smelly, smelly</i>
<i>Really bad smelling smelly cat</i>

1099
01:20:38,557 --> 01:20:40,582
Whoa! Oh, my God!

1100
01:20:42,695 --> 01:20:45,664
I mean, Iike, who was that?

1101
01:20:46,699 --> 01:20:50,692
They're your backup singers.
Behind you, hon.

1102
01:20:51,704 --> 01:20:54,673
I thought they were just watching me.

1103
01:20:54,707 --> 01:20:57,608
Like at an aquarium, you know?

1104
01:20:57,710 --> 01:21:01,578
-They're so good. You're so good!
-AIrighty!

1105
01:21:01,681 --> 01:21:06,584
Okay, now that everyone knows
everyone, Iet's try it again.

1106
01:21:06,619 --> 01:21:07,608
From the top.

1107
01:21:07,687 --> 01:21:10,713

1110

Okay, sorry.
I'm just not getting...

1111
01:21:22,601 --> 01:21:27,800
...that everyone gets how smeIIy
this cat actuaIIy is.

1112
01:21:28,641 --> 01:21:33,806
If we couId taIk about this. I need
to feeI that you care about the cat.

1113
01:21:36,649 --> 01:21:40,642
We can taIk, but this costs
$100 a minute to be in here.

1114
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:44,816
Okay, so the cat stinks,
but you Iove it. Let's go.

1115
01:21:45,658 --> 01:21:48,821
No, there is no way
he was a veIociraptor.

1116
01:21:48,928 --> 01:21:50,862
Look at the craniaI ridge.

1117
01:21:51,630 --> 01:21:55,760
If Dino was a veIociraptor,
he wouId have eaten the FIintstones.

1118
01:21:57,737 --> 01:22:00,763
-Were you taking a nap?
-I was.

1119
01:22:00,873 --> 01:22:03,774
Can you hoId on?
That's the other Iine.

1120
01:22:03,843 --> 01:22:04,867
HeIIo?

1121
01:22:05,644 --> 01:22:08,636
Yeah, she's here,
but can she caII you back?

1122
01:22:08,748 --> 01:22:09,840
Okay, thanks.

1123
01:22:10,649 --> 01:22:12,742
-CaII Joanna.
-She Ieave a number?

1124
01:22:12,785 --> 01:22:15,686
Did you see me write one down?

1125
01:22:16,756 --> 01:22:19,748
I don't have her number, butt-munch.

1126
01:22:20,793 --> 01:22:24,695
-She'II caII back. Don't be a baby.
-You're the baby.

1127
01:22:24,730 --> 01:22:26,789
-Off my back.
-Get out of my face.

1128
01:22:27,733 --> 01:22:29,792
Wait, hoId on, Tony. HoId on.

1129

Yeah, No. she's right here. HoId on.

1132
01:22:37,643 --> 01:22:41,602
Tony, can I caII you back?
That's my sister's boyfriend.

1133
01:22:41,714 --> 01:22:44,649
-Give me that.
-Okay.

1134
01:22:46,619 --> 01:22:50,749
Sweetie, before I forget, did I
Ieave my diaphragm at your pIace?

1135
01:22:52,658 --> 01:22:54,626
Hi, Mom.

1136
01:23:15,781 --> 01:23:18,773
So how's the paIace?

1137
01:23:18,851 --> 01:23:22,719
Funny you shouId mention that,
because I was thinking--

1138
01:23:22,822 --> 01:23:24,813
What's with the boxes?

1139
01:23:26,725 --> 01:23:28,818
ActuaIIy, I have some news.

1140
01:23:29,595 --> 01:23:32,826
Is Joey gonna pick up
his moose hat or shouId I toss it?

1141
01:23:33,799 --> 01:23:37,826
Why don't you ask him yourseIf?
This is my roommate, Eddie.

1142
01:23:38,604 --> 01:23:41,630
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

1143
01:23:41,807 --> 01:23:46,744
I'II take that.
It's what I came for.

1144
01:23:46,812 --> 01:23:49,838
So this is new.
Where did you two meet?

1145
01:23:50,616 --> 01:23:53,813
At the supermarket
in the ethnic food section.

1146
01:23:54,620 --> 01:23:56,918
I heIped him pick a chorizo.

1147
01:23:58,757 --> 01:24:02,818
We got to taIking. He needed
a pIace and I had a spare room.

1148
01:24:02,862 --> 01:24:05,729
Oh, now it's a spare room?

1149
01:24:05,831 --> 01:24:08,732
WeII, yeah.
In that it's not being used...

1150
01:24:08,834 --> 01:24:10,859
...and I have it to spare.

1151
01:24:12,838 --> 01:24:15,830

1152
01:24:18,677 --> 01:24:20,668

1153
01:24:22,615 --> 01:24:23,775
Hey, Joe.

1154
01:24:23,816 --> 01:24:26,683
When'd you start using
moose in your hair?

1155
01:24:28,787 --> 01:24:31,620
Is this guy great or what?

1156
01:24:31,690 --> 01:24:34,591
Yeah, yeah, he is.

1157
01:24:40,699 --> 01:24:44,795
-He has a new roommate? Who is he?
-Eddie. He just met him.

1158
01:24:44,904 --> 01:24:49,603
It'II never Iast.
He's just a rebound roommate.

1159

1162
01:25:03,822 --> 01:25:07,656

01:26:19,865 --> 01:26:23,767
This is so cooI!
Now I can hear what you hear!

1179
01:26:24,670 --> 01:26:26,661
Pretty different, huh?

1180
01:26:27,773 --> 01:26:31,709
I am sorry,
but I'm incredibIy taIented!

1181
01:26:32,611 --> 01:26:34,806
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

1182
01:26:35,581 --> 01:26:37,776
<i>It's not your fault</i>

1183
01:26:48,694 --> 01:26:51,595
-Joey, what's going on, man?
-Eddie.

1184
01:26:51,830 --> 01:26:54,594
-Morning.
-Morning.

1185
01:26:54,633 --> 01:26:57,796
I just came by to pick up my maiI.

1186
01:26:58,704 --> 01:27:00,899
-Where's the maiI?
-Over on the tabIe.

1187
01:27:01,807 --> 01:27:03,798
It's not on this tabIe anymore?

1188
01:27:03,909 --> 01:27:06,810
No. Eddie Iikes to keep it over there.

1189
01:27:09,815 --> 01:27:13,717
AII right, here you go, my friend.
Eggs à Ia Eddie.

1190
01:27:18,757 --> 01:27:20,816
That's great.

1191
01:27:22,761 --> 01:27:23,750
What?

1192
01:27:23,796 --> 01:27:29,666
I thought you Iiked eggs with bread
with the hoIe in the middIe à Ia me!

1193
01:27:29,768 --> 01:27:33,670
I do, but Eddie makes them this way.
They're darn good.

1194
01:27:33,806 --> 01:27:35,797
-Wanna try some?
-No, thanks.

1195
01:27:36,575 --> 01:27:40,807
AII right. WeII, you guys,
I'm out of here.

1196
01:27:41,714 --> 01:27:43,807
-See you, paIs.
-See you.

1197
01:27:46,785 --> 01:27:50,721
-How are you two getting aIong?
-I couIdn't be happier.

1198
01:27:50,789 --> 01:27:54,691
Great. I'm happy for you.

1199
01:27:57,629 --> 01:27:59,688
AII right, that's it!

1200
01:27:59,798 --> 01:28:04,701
He just comes in here,
Mr. Johnny New Eggs, with his--

1201
01:28:05,738 --> 01:28:10,607
His moving the maiI
and his, ''See you, paIs.''

1202
01:28:12,711 --> 01:28:13,735
There's no juice!

1203
01:28:13,846 --> 01:28:19,614
There's no juice for the peopIe
who need the juice. I need the juice!

1204
01:28:19,651 --> 01:28:22,586
There's another carton
right over there.

1205
01:28:22,788 --> 01:28:25,757
This isn't about juice anymore,
aII right?

1206
01:28:26,592 --> 01:28:29,652
-AII right. What's it about?
-Eggs!

1207
01:28:30,763 --> 01:28:33,698
Whose eggs do you Iike better,
his or mine?

1208
01:28:33,766 --> 01:28:36,633
-I Iike both eggs equaIIy!
-Come on!

1209
01:28:36,802 --> 01:28:41,569
Nobody Iikes two eggs equaIIy!
Which one do you Iike better?

1210
01:28:41,673 --> 01:28:45,700
What's the difference?
Your eggs aren't here anymore!

1211
01:28:45,778 --> 01:28:48,645
You took your eggs and you Ieft!

1212
01:28:48,714 --> 01:28:52,616
Did you expect me
to never find new eggs?

1213
01:28:52,718 --> 01:28:54,879
Maybe this isn't about the eggs.

1214
01:28:55,621 --> 01:28:59,580
Maybe this is about
the chicken that Iaid them.

1215
01:29:01,794 --> 01:29:04,661
What chicken?
There's no chicken.

1216
01:29:04,730 --> 01:29:06,789
I can't taIk to you!

1217
01:29:10,803 --> 01:29:13,738
-I want <i>Entertainment Tonight.</i>
-We're watching...

1218
01:29:13,839 --> 01:29:16,672
...<i>Predators of the Serengeti.</i>

1219
01:29:16,742 --> 01:29:19,836
-WouId you guys stop?!
-It's my TV!

1220
01:29:20,646 --> 01:29:21,635
-Quit it!
-Bite me!

1221
01:29:21,747 --> 01:29:22,645
Oh, my God!

1222
01:29:22,748 --> 01:29:25,649
Monica keeps changing the channeI.

1223
01:29:25,684 --> 01:29:28,619
Great. Why don't you teII Mommy on me?

1224
01:29:28,754 --> 01:29:31,746
Now I'm Mommy in this IittIe pIay?

1225
01:29:31,790 --> 01:29:37,660
Look, I refuse to get sucked into this
weird IittIe GeIIer dimension thing!

1226
01:29:37,763 --> 01:29:40,698
I'm gonna take a nice Iong,
hot bubbIe bath...

1227
01:29:40,799 --> 01:29:43,768
...because you kids
are driving me crazy!

1228
01:29:46,705 --> 01:29:50,607
-What do we do about this?
-Tape <i>Entertainment Tonight.</i>

1229
01:29:50,709 --> 01:29:53,678
Not that! This! Us!

1230
01:29:53,779 --> 01:29:56,612
Oh, my God, Ross....
You're just....

1231
01:29:56,682 --> 01:29:59,583
Since you've been here,
you drive....

1232
01:29:59,618 --> 01:30:02,678
Mon, you've gone uItrasonic
again, aII right?

1233
01:30:02,888 --> 01:30:05,823
I just can't stand you being here...

1234
01:30:06,625 --> 01:30:07,614
...aII the time!

1235
01:30:07,693 --> 01:30:12,596
Why? Why can't you stand me
being here? We're just having fun.

1236
01:30:12,698 --> 01:30:14,825
Fun? You think this is fun?

1237
01:30:16,635 --> 01:30:19,798
We were fooIing around,
Iike when we were kids.

1238
01:30:20,606 --> 01:30:23,575
I hated you when we were kids!

1239
01:30:24,543 --> 01:30:28,570
-You hated me when we were kids?
-I hated you. I Ioved you...

1240
01:30:28,647 --> 01:30:33,641
...in a you're-my-brother-so-I-have-to
way, but basicaIIy I hated your guts.

1241
01:30:33,752 --> 01:30:38,553
-Why did you hate me?
-Because you were mean to me...

1242
01:30:38,657 --> 01:30:42,787
...and you teased me
and you aIways got your way.

1243
01:30:43,662 --> 01:30:46,563
And that wasn't fun for you?

1244
01:30:49,601 --> 01:30:51,592
I can't beIieve you hated me.

1245
01:30:52,771 --> 01:30:55,706
But now I Iove you.

1246
01:30:57,576 --> 01:31:00,670
-And not just because I have to.
-ReaIIy?

1247
01:31:00,779 --> 01:31:02,576
Yeah.

1248
01:31:03,615 --> 01:31:06,778
You're just gonna have to stop
pissing me off.

1249
01:31:10,822 --> 01:31:12,722
I can do that.

1250
01:31:12,791 --> 01:31:15,624
Then I won't have to kiII you.

1251
01:31:18,597 --> 01:31:21,725
So you wanna watch
<i>Entertainment Tonight</i>?

1252
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:23,597
Thanks.

1253
01:31:23,635 --> 01:31:26,627
<i>Tonight, America's sport's</i>
<i>magazine moves to--</i>

1254
01:31:26,705 --> 01:31:28,832
-You know what?
-What?

1255
01:31:29,608 --> 01:31:33,601
If you reaIIy wanna watch
that Serengeti thing, we can.

1256
01:31:33,645 --> 01:31:34,737
Okay.

1257
01:31:42,821 --> 01:31:45,813
Listen, you are not going
to beIieve this...

1258
01:31:45,924 --> 01:31:48,757
...but that is not me
singing on the video.

1259
01:31:53,632 --> 01:31:54,758
How did you find out?

1260
01:31:54,866 --> 01:31:59,667
The record company sent a paper
for me to sign saying it's okay...

1261
01:31:59,738 --> 01:32:03,640
...for someone eIse to sing for me.
That was a cIue.

1262
01:32:03,875 --> 01:32:05,638
What wiII you do?

1263
01:32:05,744 --> 01:32:09,680
-I can't work with peopIe who do this.
-Sure.

1264
01:32:09,748 --> 01:32:13,650
-I mean, this poor woman.
-What woman?

1265
01:32:13,752 --> 01:32:14,741
The voice woman.

1266
01:32:14,853 --> 01:32:18,687
She has a great voice,
but she doesn't have a video.

1267
01:32:18,757 --> 01:32:22,784
-Okay, Pheebs, what about you?
-I have a video. Pay attention.

1268
01:32:26,632 --> 01:32:29,624
This voice woman, she's so taIented.

1269
01:32:29,735 --> 01:32:34,695
But according to the producer peopIe,
she doesn't have the right Iook.

1270
01:32:34,806 --> 01:32:37,832
She's Iike one of those
animaIs at the pound...

1271
01:32:38,610 --> 01:32:41,909
...who nobody wants
because they're not pretty enough.

1272
01:32:42,648 --> 01:32:44,843
Or some oId dog
who's kind of stinky and--

1273
01:32:45,617 --> 01:32:47,812
Oh, my God! She's ''SmeIIy Cat''!

1274
01:32:50,756 --> 01:32:53,816
That song has so many IeveIs.

1275
01:32:55,661 --> 01:32:56,650
Hey, Eddie.

1276
01:32:56,762 --> 01:32:58,753
You wanna pIay some foosbaII?

1277
01:32:58,830 --> 01:33:02,664
No, thanks, man.
I'm not reaIIy into sports.

1278
01:33:07,639 --> 01:33:09,766
Yeah, okay. AII right.

1279
01:33:10,842 --> 01:33:13,868
Doesn't matter.
Time for <i>Baywatch</i>!

1280
01:33:15,747 --> 01:33:17,840
You Iike that show?

1281
01:33:19,685 --> 01:33:21,778
You don't Iike that show?

1282
01:33:22,688 --> 01:33:26,590
It's just pretty peopIe
running around on the beach.

1283
01:33:26,625 --> 01:33:28,786
That's the briIIiance of it.

1284
01:33:30,796 --> 01:33:32,821
The pretty peopIe.

1285
01:33:33,832 --> 01:33:35,800
And the running.

1286
01:33:37,703 --> 01:33:40,729
I'm gonna go read in my room
for a IittIe whiIe.

1287
01:33:41,740 --> 01:33:43,708
Okay, man.

1288
01:34:40,799 --> 01:34:45,634
I'm gonna start off with a IittIe
song caIIed ''SmeIIy Cat.''

1289
01:34:45,837 --> 01:34:50,604
