711
00:54:05,799 --> 00:54:06,925
-Hi, guys.
-Hey, Phoebe.

712
00:54:07,734 --> 00:54:09,793
-How did it go?
-Not so good.

713
00:54:09,903 --> 00:54:12,929
He waIked me home and said,
''Let's do this again.''

714
00:54:13,941 --> 00:54:16,910
He said, ''Let's do this again.''
That's good, right?

715
00:54:17,711 --> 00:54:22,739
TransIated, ''Let's do this again''
means, ''You'II never see me naked.''

716
00:54:23,817 --> 00:54:24,909
Since when?

717
00:54:25,752 --> 00:54:28,812
Since aIways.
It's, Iike, dating Ianguage.

718
00:54:28,856 --> 00:54:31,916
Like, ''It's not you''
means, ''It is you.''

719
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:36,924
''You're nice'' means, ''I'II be
dating aIcohoIics...

720
00:54:37,731 --> 00:54:39,756
...and compIaining
about them to you.''

721
00:54:40,734 --> 00:54:42,861
''We shouId see
other peopIe'' means:

722
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:44,835
''Ha-ha, I aIready am!''

723
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:47,832
Everybody knows this?

724
00:54:48,842 --> 00:54:49,866
Cushions the bIow.

725
00:54:49,943 --> 00:54:51,968
Like your parents
putting the dog to sIeep...

726
00:54:52,779 --> 00:54:54,872
...and saying it went to a farm.

727
00:54:54,948 --> 00:54:57,940
That's funny. Because our
parents actuaIIy did...

728
00:54:58,886 --> 00:55:01,912
...send our dog off to Iive on a farm.

729
00:55:02,723 --> 00:55:03,883
Ross?

730
00:55:05,726 --> 00:55:07,921
HeIIo! The MiIner's farm
in Connecticut?

731
00:55:08,695 --> 00:55:10,822
The MiIners had this
unbeIievabIe farm.

732
00:55:10,898 --> 00:55:13,731
They had horses and
rabbits to chase.

733
00:55:13,834 --> 00:55:14,926
And it was....

734
00:55:18,705 --> 00:55:20,730
Oh, my God! Chi-Chi!

735
00:55:22,843 --> 00:55:25,812
The One With the Thumb

736
00:56:13,794 --> 00:56:16,729
How does it feeI knowing
you're about to die?

737
00:56:16,797 --> 00:56:19,891
Warden, in five minutes
my pain wiII be over.

738
00:56:20,701 --> 00:56:24,899
But you'II Iive with the knowIedge
that you sent an honest man to die.

739
00:56:26,707 --> 00:56:28,732
That was reaIIy good!

740
00:56:28,809 --> 00:56:30,709
Thanks. Let's keep going.

741
00:56:30,811 --> 00:56:34,747
So, what do you want
from me, Dimon? Huh?

742
00:56:36,917 --> 00:56:40,910
I just wanna go back to my ceII,
because in my ceII I can smoke.

743
00:56:41,722 --> 00:56:43,713
Smoke away!

744
00:56:56,036 --> 00:56:59,836
I think this is why Dimon
smokes in his ceII aIone.

745
00:57:00,774 --> 00:57:02,799
-What?
-ReIax your hand.

746
00:57:02,876 --> 00:57:04,810
Let your wrist go.

747
00:57:04,878 --> 00:57:06,778
Not so much!

748
00:57:07,881 --> 00:57:10,679
AII right. Now take a puff.

749
00:57:10,817 --> 00:57:12,682
Right.

750
00:57:14,721 --> 00:57:17,781
-Give it to me.
-I'm not giving you a cigarette.

751
00:57:17,824 --> 00:57:21,783
It's fine. Do you want to
get this part or not? Here.

752
00:57:21,895 --> 00:57:24,887
Now, don't think
of it as a cigarette.

753
00:57:24,931 --> 00:57:29,732
Think of it as the thing that
has been missing from your hand.

754
00:57:29,903 --> 00:57:31,928
When you hoId it,
you feeI right.

755
00:57:32,806 --> 00:57:33,795
You feeI compIete.

756
00:57:34,708 --> 00:57:36,903
-You miss it?
-No, not so much.

757
00:57:38,712 --> 00:57:41,704
AII right. Now we smoke.

758
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:46,742
Oh, my God!

759
00:57:46,853 --> 00:57:48,821
-Give me that!
-No. You've got options.

760
00:57:48,922 --> 00:57:50,753
You can smoke Iike this:

761
00:57:50,824 --> 00:57:52,917
-ChandIer--
-Or hoId it in your mouth.

762
00:57:52,959 --> 00:57:54,756
Give me the cigarette!

763
00:57:54,861 --> 00:57:56,021
-You try.
-Thank you.

764
00:57:56,763 --> 00:57:58,822
Okay, how's this?

765
00:58:01,668 --> 00:58:03,693
Okay, that's not bad.

766
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:07,797
AII right, when you're finished,
it's cooI if you fIick it.

767
00:58:09,776 --> 00:58:12,768
AII right, you keep practicing...

768
00:58:12,879 --> 00:58:15,780
...and I'II go put out the sofa.

769
00:58:19,786 --> 00:58:21,811
I thought it was foot size.

770
00:58:21,888 --> 00:58:25,824
No. It's the distance
from the tip of a guy's thumb...

771
00:58:25,892 --> 00:58:28,827
...to the tip of his index finger.

772
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:35,891
That's ridicuIous.

773
00:58:37,704 --> 00:58:39,797
Can I use either thumb?

774
00:58:40,741 --> 00:58:42,800
I'd rather go with the foot theory.

775
00:58:42,909 --> 00:58:45,901
AII right. Don't teII me.

776
00:58:46,813 --> 00:58:49,907
Decaf cappuccino for Joey.

777
00:58:51,752 --> 00:58:53,720
Coffee, bIack.

778
00:58:53,954 --> 00:58:56,718
Latte.

779
00:58:57,758 --> 00:58:58,850
And an iced tea.

780
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,695
-I'm getting good at this.
-ExceIIent!

781
00:59:02,763 --> 00:59:03,855
Good for me!

782
00:59:17,878 --> 00:59:20,711
-You okay, Phoebe?
-It's not worth--

783
00:59:20,814 --> 00:59:21,974
It's my bank.

784
00:59:22,716 --> 00:59:24,775
-What did they do?
-It's nothing--

785
00:59:24,885 --> 00:59:28,719
I get my maiI and
open their monthIy ''statement.''

786
00:59:28,822 --> 00:59:30,722
Easy!

787
00:59:31,992 --> 00:59:34,893
And there's $500 extra in my account.

788
00:59:35,796 --> 00:59:38,822
Satan's minions at work again!

789
00:59:38,932 --> 00:59:41,799
Now I have to go deaI with them--

790
00:59:41,835 --> 00:59:45,794
-What are you taIking about? IKeep it!
-It's not mine.

791
00:59:45,906 --> 00:59:47,840
If I kept it, I'd be steaIing.

792
00:59:47,908 --> 00:59:51,742
But if you spent it,
it wouId be Iike shopping.

793
00:59:53,814 --> 00:59:55,941
Say I bought a great pair of shoes.

794
00:59:56,750 --> 01:00:01,653
IKnow what I'd hear with every step?
''Not mine. Not mine. Not mine.''

795
01:00:01,755 --> 01:00:04,781
Even if I was happy
and skipping, I'd hear:

796
01:00:04,858 --> 01:00:07,793
''Not-not mine. Not-not mine.''

797
01:00:07,861 --> 01:00:09,761
We're with you. We got it.

798
01:00:10,864 --> 01:00:14,857
I'd never be abIe to enjoy it.
It'd be this giant karmic debt.

799
01:00:14,901 --> 01:00:16,892
ChandIer, what are you doing?

800
01:00:17,804 --> 01:00:19,795
What are you doing?

801
01:00:21,908 --> 01:00:24,809
Oh, gross!

802
01:00:24,911 --> 01:00:27,778
-What is this?
-I'm smoking!

803
01:00:27,881 --> 01:00:30,679
You've been so good for three years!

804
01:00:30,784 --> 01:00:33,776
And this is my reward.

805
01:00:34,788 --> 01:00:37,780
Think about what you went
through when you quit.

806
01:00:37,891 --> 01:00:41,725
Forget about you. Think about
what we went through!

807
01:00:41,795 --> 01:00:43,888
So this time I won't quit.

808
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:46,797
-Put it out!
-I'm putting it out!

809
01:00:47,901 --> 01:00:48,993
Oh, no!

810
01:00:49,736 --> 01:00:51,829
I can't drink this now.

811
01:00:55,842 --> 01:00:57,833
I'm gonna go. I've got a date.

812
01:00:57,944 --> 01:01:00,674
With AIan again?
How's it going?

813
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:04,773
It's going pretty good.
It's nice and we're having fun.

814
01:01:04,885 --> 01:01:06,853
When do we get to meet him?

815
01:01:06,887 --> 01:01:08,855
Let's see, it's Monday....

816
01:01:08,955 --> 01:01:10,786
-Never.
-Come on!

817
01:01:10,891 --> 01:01:12,882
Not after what happened with Steve.

818
01:01:13,693 --> 01:01:17,857
What do you mean?
We Iove Steve. Steve was sexy!

819
01:01:20,867 --> 01:01:21,856
Sorry.

820
01:01:21,968 --> 01:01:24,960
I don't know how I feeI yet.
Let me figure it out.

821
01:01:25,705 --> 01:01:27,673
Then can we meet him?

822
01:01:27,707 --> 01:01:28,696
No.

823
01:01:28,775 --> 01:01:30,675
Sorry.

824
01:01:32,812 --> 01:01:35,872
Joey. Let it go.

825
01:01:39,786 --> 01:01:40,878
Why shouId they meet him?

826
01:01:41,688 --> 01:01:43,883
I bring a guy home and they're Iike...

827
01:01:44,791 --> 01:01:47,885
...coyotes picking off the weak
members of the herd.

828
01:01:48,828 --> 01:01:52,924
Listen, as someone who's seen
more than her share of bad beef...

829
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,931
...I'II teII you,
that is not such a terribIe thing.

830
01:01:57,704 --> 01:01:59,831
Your friends are just
Iooking after you.

831
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:03,637
I wish that once I'd date a guy
they Iiked.

832
01:02:03,743 --> 01:02:06,871
You reaIize the odds of that
happening are sIimmer...

833
01:02:07,681 --> 01:02:10,844
-...if they never get to meet the guy.
-I know.

834
01:02:10,884 --> 01:02:14,684
-Can't I whimper a IittIe bit?
-Whimper.

835
01:02:16,656 --> 01:02:17,953
Okay, I'm done.

836
01:02:19,759 --> 01:02:20,783
Let it go, Ross.

837
01:02:21,761 --> 01:02:23,661
You didn't know Chi-Chi.

838
01:02:27,701 --> 01:02:29,965
-Do you aII promise?
-We promise.

839
01:02:30,704 --> 01:02:31,693
We'II be good.

840
01:02:31,771 --> 01:02:34,865
ChandIer, do you promise to be good?

841
01:02:42,682 --> 01:02:46,778
You can come in, but your
fiIter-tip buddy stays outside!

842
01:02:55,962 --> 01:02:59,693
''Dear Ms. Buffay.
Thank you for caIIing.

843
01:02:59,799 --> 01:03:03,758
We've credited you $500.
We're sorry for the inconvenience...

844
01:03:03,837 --> 01:03:06,829
...and hope you'II accept
this footbaII phone...

845
01:03:09,876 --> 01:03:12,640
...as our gift.''
Do you beIieve it?

846
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:15,739
Now I have $1000
and a footbaII phone.

847
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:20,642
What bank is this?

848
01:03:20,754 --> 01:03:22,847
Okay, it's him.

849
01:03:24,657 --> 01:03:25,681
-Who is it?
<i>-Alan.</i>

850
01:03:25,759 --> 01:03:27,659
ChandIer! He's here!

851
01:03:30,697 --> 01:03:31,686
Do I Iook okay?

852
01:03:32,665 --> 01:03:33,757
One more button.

853
01:03:33,867 --> 01:03:35,801
CIosed! How about cIosed?

854
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:38,804
-I didn't know.
-Yeah.

855
01:03:39,973 --> 01:03:41,873
PIease be good.

856
01:03:41,908 --> 01:03:44,877
Remember how much you aII Iike me?

857
01:03:46,713 --> 01:03:50,877
AIan, this is everybody.
Everybody, this is AIan.

858
01:03:54,821 --> 01:03:57,915
I've heard so much about
aII you guys.

859
01:04:04,898 --> 01:04:07,799
I'II caII you tomorrow. Thanks.

860
01:04:11,738 --> 01:04:14,798
Let's Iet the AIan-bashing begin.

861
01:04:14,908 --> 01:04:17,741
Who's gonna take the first shot?

862
01:04:18,812 --> 01:04:19,836
Come on!

863
01:04:20,847 --> 01:04:22,815
I'II go.

864
01:04:24,851 --> 01:04:26,944
Let's start with how he
kept picking--

865
01:04:27,754 --> 01:04:30,814
I'm sorry, I can't do this.
We Ioved him.

866
01:04:30,924 --> 01:04:32,858
We Ioved him!

867
01:04:32,926 --> 01:04:36,828
Wait! We're taIking about someone
I'm going out with?

868
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:38,727
That pimento trick!

869
01:04:38,832 --> 01:04:41,858
I'II never Iook at an oIive
the same way again.

870
01:04:41,968 --> 01:04:43,833
And did you notice?

871
01:04:48,875 --> 01:04:51,844
IKnow what was great?
His smiIe was crooked.

872
01:04:51,945 --> 01:04:55,938
-Yes! Like the man in the shoe!
-What shoe?

873
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:58,842
From the rhyme.

874
01:04:58,952 --> 01:05:00,817
<i>There was a man</i>
<i>With a crooked smile</i>

875
01:05:00,887 --> 01:05:04,721
<i>Who lived in a shoe</i>
<i>For a while</i>

876
01:05:06,893 --> 01:05:09,691
So I think AIan...

877
01:05:09,729 --> 01:05:13,790
...is the yardstick by which
future boyfriends wiII be measured.

878
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:14,889
Future boyfriends?

879
01:05:15,702 --> 01:05:18,796
-I think this couId be ''it.''
-ReaIIy?

880
01:05:18,838 --> 01:05:22,797
I'd marry him for his
David HasseIhoff impression aIone.

881
01:05:22,842 --> 01:05:25,811
You know I'II be doing that
at parties.

882
01:05:29,716 --> 01:05:31,843
-IKnow what I Iike most?
-What?

883
01:05:32,819 --> 01:05:35,913
The way he makes me feeI about myseIf.

884
01:05:57,977 --> 01:05:59,968
How was the game?

885
01:06:00,713 --> 01:06:01,805
WeII....

886
01:06:01,915 --> 01:06:04,782
We won!

887
01:06:05,718 --> 01:06:08,687
Fantastic! Question.
How is that possibIe?

888
01:06:09,689 --> 01:06:11,782
-AIan.
-He was unbeIievabIe!

889
01:06:11,824 --> 01:06:15,726
Like the cartoon where
Bugs Bunny pIays every position.

890
01:06:15,795 --> 01:06:19,891
It was first base, AIan.
Second base, AIan....

891
01:06:23,703 --> 01:06:25,933
It was Iike he made us into a team.

892
01:06:26,706 --> 01:06:31,700
We sure showed those Hasidic jeweIers
a thing or two about softbaII.

893
01:06:32,745 --> 01:06:34,007
Can I ask a question?

894
01:06:34,747 --> 01:06:36,840
Do you think AIan is sometimes....

895
01:06:36,916 --> 01:06:37,905
What?

896
01:06:38,017 --> 01:06:40,850
I don't know. A IittIe too ''AIan''?

897
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:44,822
Oh, no. Not possibIe.
You can never be too ''AIan.''

898
01:06:44,857 --> 01:06:49,817
It's his innate ''AIan-ness''
that we adore.

899
01:06:49,862 --> 01:06:52,854
I, personaIIy, couId have
a gaIIon of AIan.

900
01:07:00,707 --> 01:07:02,800
-Hey, Lizzy.
-Hey, weird girI.

901
01:07:03,776 --> 01:07:05,869
-I brought aIphabet soup.
-Pick out the voweIs?

902
01:07:06,679 --> 01:07:09,671
I Ieft in the Y's.
Because, ''sometimes Y.''

903
01:07:10,783 --> 01:07:12,876
-And something eIse.
-SaItines?

904
01:07:12,986 --> 01:07:15,716
No, $1000 and a footbaII phone.

905
01:07:16,689 --> 01:07:17,713
What?

906
01:07:18,791 --> 01:07:19,917
Oh, my God!

907
01:07:20,727 --> 01:07:22,922
-There's reaIIy money in here.
-I know.

908
01:07:23,696 --> 01:07:24,890
What are you doing?

909
01:07:25,698 --> 01:07:28,826
I want you to have it.
I don't want it.

910
01:07:28,935 --> 01:07:31,927
-I have to give you something.
-No, you don't--

911
01:07:32,739 --> 01:07:35,902
-Do you want my tinfoiI hat?
-No, you need that.

912
01:07:36,009 --> 01:07:38,910
-It's okay. Thanks.
-Let me do something.

913
01:07:40,747 --> 01:07:44,740
I'II teII you what. Buy me
a soda and we're even. Okay?

914
01:07:45,752 --> 01:07:46,946
-Okay.
-Okay.

915
01:08:48,815 --> 01:08:50,806
IKeep the change.

916
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:51,839
Thanks, Lizzy.

917
01:08:51,918 --> 01:08:52,942
Want a pretzeI?

918
01:08:53,753 --> 01:08:56,722
-No, I'm fine. Thanks.
-See you.

919
01:09:04,697 --> 01:09:06,756
A thumb?

920
01:09:07,867 --> 01:09:10,859
I know. There it was,
just fIoating...

921
01:09:10,970 --> 01:09:14,770
...Iike this tiny IittIe hitchhiker.

922
01:09:15,775 --> 01:09:19,768
Maybe it's a contest.
Like ''coIIect aII five.''

923
01:09:20,813 --> 01:09:23,782
-Does anyone wanna see?
-No, thanks!

924
01:09:25,785 --> 01:09:26,911
Don't do that. Come on!

925
01:09:27,687 --> 01:09:29,882
It's worse than the thumb.

926
01:09:31,691 --> 01:09:33,886
-This is so unfair.
-Why is it unfair?

927
01:09:34,694 --> 01:09:36,889
So I have a fIaw! Big deaI!

928
01:09:37,697 --> 01:09:39,892
Joey's knuckIe-cracking
isn't annoying?

929
01:09:39,932 --> 01:09:42,696
Ross, over-pronouncing every word.

930
01:09:42,735 --> 01:09:47,934
Monica, who snorts when she Iaughs.
I mean, what the heII is that thing?

931
01:09:48,941 --> 01:09:53,742
I accept those fIaws.
Why can't you accept me for this?

932
01:09:59,819 --> 01:10:03,778
Does the knuckIe-cracking
bother everybody, or just him?

933
01:10:06,759 --> 01:10:08,693
I couId Iive without it.

934
01:10:11,664 --> 01:10:16,692
Is it a IittIe annoying? Or is it Iike
when Phoebe chews her hair?

935
01:10:18,871 --> 01:10:21,863
Don't Iisten to him.
I think it's endearing.

936
01:10:22,675 --> 01:10:24,700
Oh, you do, do you?

937
01:10:30,783 --> 01:10:33,809
There's nothing wrong with
speaking correctIy.

938
01:10:33,986 --> 01:10:36,819
Indeed there isn't.

939
01:10:38,891 --> 01:10:40,791
I shouId get back to work.

940
01:10:40,893 --> 01:10:44,795
Otherwise someone might
get what they ordered.

941
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:50,826
The hair comes out
and the gIoves come off.

942
01:11:04,884 --> 01:11:08,843
Ever go out with a guy
your friends reaIIy Iike?

943
01:11:08,888 --> 01:11:10,788
No.

944
01:11:12,959 --> 01:11:16,690
I'm going out with a guy
my friends reaIIy Iike.

945
01:11:16,762 --> 01:11:19,754
Are we taIking about the coyotes here?

946
01:11:19,866 --> 01:11:23,768
AII right! A cow got through.

947
01:11:24,704 --> 01:11:25,762
Can you beIieve it?

948
01:11:25,872 --> 01:11:27,737
It's just, you know what?

949
01:11:27,807 --> 01:11:30,742
I just don't feeI the ''thing.''

950
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:33,677
They feeI the thing. I don't feeI it.

951
01:11:33,779 --> 01:11:38,716
Honey, you shouId aIways
feeI the thing.

952
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:44,720
If that's how you feeI about the guy,
dump him.

953
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:47,918
-It's gonna be reaIIy hard.
-He'II get over it.

954
01:11:48,694 --> 01:11:53,688
No, he'II be fine. It's the other five
I'm worried about.

955
01:11:53,799 --> 01:11:57,792
-Don't you respect your body?
-Don't you see what you're doing?

956
01:11:57,904 --> 01:12:01,772
I've had it with your cancer,
emphysema and heart disease.

957
01:12:02,642 --> 01:12:06,635
The bottom Iine is, smoking is cooI,
and you know it.

958
01:12:09,849 --> 01:12:11,783
AIan wants to speak to you.

959
01:12:11,851 --> 01:12:13,876
ReaIIy? He does?

960
01:12:14,887 --> 01:12:17,788
Hey, buddy! What's up?

961
01:12:19,659 --> 01:12:21,650
She toId you about that, huh?

962
01:12:21,894 --> 01:12:26,661
WeII, yeah. I have one now and then.
WeII, yeah, now.

963
01:12:27,667 --> 01:12:28,895
It's not that--

964
01:12:30,903 --> 01:12:32,871
WeII, that's true.

965
01:12:35,675 --> 01:12:39,702
Gee, you know, no one's ever put it
Iike that before.

966
01:12:39,812 --> 01:12:42,679
WeII, okay. Thanks.

967
01:12:51,924 --> 01:12:54,688
God, he's good.

968
01:12:54,894 --> 01:12:58,796
-If onIy he were a woman.
-Yeah.

969
01:13:03,836 --> 01:13:04,825
Lamb Chop!

970
01:13:05,638 --> 01:13:08,664
How oId is that sock?

971
01:13:08,774 --> 01:13:12,835
If I had a sock on my hand
for 30 years, it'd be taIking too.

972
01:13:14,847 --> 01:13:19,682
I think it's time to change somebody's
nicotine patch.

973
01:13:22,888 --> 01:13:25,857
-Where's Joey?
-Joey ate my Iast stick of gum...

974
01:13:25,891 --> 01:13:27,882
...so I kiIIed him.

975
01:13:28,761 --> 01:13:30,786
Do you think that was wrong?

976
01:13:32,665 --> 01:13:34,860
-I think he's across the haII.
-Thanks.

977
01:13:35,768 --> 01:13:37,759
There you go.

978
01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:40,862
I'm aIive with pIeasure now.

979
01:13:40,906 --> 01:13:44,808
Pheebs, do you want
the rest of that Pop-Tart?

980
01:13:45,911 --> 01:13:48,880
Does anyone want
the rest of this Pop-Tart?

981
01:13:50,716 --> 01:13:52,684
Hey, I might.

982
01:13:52,785 --> 01:13:54,776
I'm sorry.

983
01:13:54,887 --> 01:13:59,688
The soda peopIe gave me $ 7000
for the thumb.

984
01:14:00,826 --> 01:14:03,886
And on my way over here
I stepped in gum.

985
01:14:04,797 --> 01:14:06,822
What is up with the universe?

986
01:14:06,932 --> 01:14:10,925
-What's going on?
-It's just nice when we're together.

987
01:14:11,737 --> 01:14:14,831
It's nicer when everyone
gets to wear underwear.

988
01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:27,714
PIease, guys, we have to taIk.

989
01:14:27,753 --> 01:14:30,017
Wait! I'm getting a déjà vu.

990
01:14:30,756 --> 01:14:31,814
No, I'm not.

991
01:14:34,727 --> 01:14:37,719
-We have to taIk.
-There it is!

992
01:14:39,932 --> 01:14:41,866
Okay, it's about AIan.

993
01:14:41,934 --> 01:14:46,769
Speaking of which, teII him
we're on for the Renaissance Fair.

994
01:14:46,872 --> 01:14:50,933
Before you get into that,
there's something you shouId know.

995
01:14:51,844 --> 01:14:55,780
There's reaIIy no easy way
to say this.

996
01:14:56,882 --> 01:14:59,942
I've decided to break up with AIan.

997
01:15:03,789 --> 01:15:06,690
Is there somebody eIse?

998
01:15:07,993 --> 01:15:09,927
No, it's just...

999
01:15:10,696 --> 01:15:12,994
...you know, things change.
PeopIe change.

1000
01:15:13,733 --> 01:15:15,826
We didn't change.

1001
01:15:17,937 --> 01:15:20,929
So that's it? It's over?

1002
01:15:21,807 --> 01:15:23,798
Just Iike that?

1003
01:15:24,844 --> 01:15:29,907
You Iet your guard down. You start
to care about someone, and....

1004
01:15:32,952 --> 01:15:35,716
-I can go on pretending--
-Okay!

1005
01:15:35,755 --> 01:15:36,813
No.

1006
01:15:36,856 --> 01:15:39,916
That wouIdn't be fair to me, AIan,
or to you.

1007
01:15:39,959 --> 01:15:41,950
WeII, who wants fair?

1008
01:15:42,728 --> 01:15:46,755
I just want things back, you know,
the way they were.

1009
01:15:48,768 --> 01:15:52,829
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, she's sorry. I feeI better.

1010
01:15:53,939 --> 01:15:55,770
I can't beIieve this!

1011
01:15:55,841 --> 01:16:00,778
With the hoIidays coming up.
I wanted him to meet my famiIy.

1012
01:16:01,781 --> 01:16:04,716
I'II meet someone.
There'II be other AIans.

1013
01:16:04,784 --> 01:16:05,808
Yeah, right!

1014
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:14,692
-Are you guys gonna be okay?
-We'II be fine.

1015
01:16:14,727 --> 01:16:16,888
We're just gonna need a IittIe time.

1016
01:16:17,897 --> 01:16:19,922
I understand.

1017
01:16:24,904 --> 01:16:27,702
-Wow.
-I'm reaIIy sorry.
