1
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:07,364
How was Joan?

2
00:00:07,442 --> 00:00:10,275
-Broke up with her.
-Oh, why?

3
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:13,439
Don't teII me.
Because of the big nostriI thing?

4
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:16,283
They were huge.

5
00:00:17,252 --> 00:00:19,345
When she sneezed, bats fIew out.

6
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:22,289
They were not that huge.

7
00:00:22,357 --> 00:00:25,451
She Ieaned back,
I couId see her brain.

8
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:31,558
How many women wiII you reject
over superficiaI, insignificant--?

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,495
HoId it. I gotta side with ChandIer.

10
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:40,469
When I first moved here, I went out
with this girI. Hot, great kisser...

11
00:00:41,276 --> 00:00:44,370
...but she had the biggest
Adam's appIe.

12
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:45,503
Drove me nuts.

13
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:50,283
-You or me?
-I got it.

14
00:00:50,385 --> 00:00:52,512
Joey, women don't have Adam's appIes.

15
00:01:00,328 --> 00:01:03,422
You guys are messing with me, right?

16
00:01:04,433 --> 00:01:06,424
Yeah. We are.

17
00:01:07,436 --> 00:01:11,338
That's a good one.
For a second there, I was Iike, whoa!

18
00:01:12,441 --> 00:01:14,432
The One Where HeckIes Dies

19
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:03,314
Name one woman you broke up with
for an actuaI reaI reason.

20
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,348
Maureen RasiIIo.

21
00:02:05,427 --> 00:02:10,228
Because she doesn't hate Yanni
is not a reaI reason.

22
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:15,333
HeIIo, Mr. HeckIes.

23
00:02:16,238 --> 00:02:19,332
-You're doing it again.
-We're not doing anything.

24
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:22,376
You're stomping.
It's disturbing my birds.

25
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:26,473
You don't have birds.

26
00:02:27,382 --> 00:02:29,350
I couId have birds.

27
00:02:30,352 --> 00:02:32,286
We'II try to keep it down.

28
00:02:32,387 --> 00:02:33,445
Thank you.

29
00:02:34,256 --> 00:02:36,383
I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.

30
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:39,293
AII right, bye-bye.

31
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:41,462
Okay, Janice.

32
00:02:42,264 --> 00:02:44,494
Give me Janice.
That wasn't being picky.

33
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,360
-We'II give you Janice.
-I miss Janice, though.

34
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,461
HeIIo, ChandIer Bing.

35
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:56,403
Oh, my God.

36
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:58,376
Oh, ChandIer.

37
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,414
Now. Now.

38
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:07,345
That's it. There. Faster.

39
00:03:14,429 --> 00:03:18,331
Stop with the broom.
We're not making noise.

40
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:29,434
We won.

41
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:31,342
We did it.

42
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:36,280
Mr. HeckIes.

43
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:42,482
-How did this happen?
-He was sweeping.

44
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,452
They found a broom in his hand.

45
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:50,261
-That's terribIe.
-I know.

46
00:03:50,465 --> 00:03:52,399
I was sweeping yesterday.

47
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,400
It couId've been me.

48
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:58,305
Sweeping. You never know.

49
00:03:58,406 --> 00:03:59,464
Never know.

50
00:04:04,212 --> 00:04:08,410
It's very faint, but I can
stiII sense him in the buiIding.

51
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:11,351
Go into the Iight, Mr. HeckIes.

52
00:04:15,223 --> 00:04:16,315
Okay, Phoebe.

53
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:20,326
I'm sorry,
sometimes they need heIp.

54
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:25,331
-Here we go.
-That's fine, go ahead and scoff.

55
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:30,327
There are things I don't beIieve in.
It doesn't mean they're not true.

56
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:31,462
Such as?

57
00:04:32,274 --> 00:04:37,541
Like crop circIes
or the Bermuda TriangIe or evoIution.

58
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:42,473
You don't beIieve in evoIution?

59
00:04:43,285 --> 00:04:44,343
Not reaIIy.

60
00:04:46,388 --> 00:04:51,291
-You don't beIieve in evoIution?
-I don't know. It's just, you know....

61
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:57,355
Monkeys, Darwin, it's a nice story.
I think it's a IittIe too easy.

62
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:02,302
''Too easy''? Too--

63
00:05:02,337 --> 00:05:06,239
The process of Iiving things
on the pIanet evoIving...

64
00:05:06,308 --> 00:05:10,335
...over years from singIe-ceIIed
organisms is ''too easy''?

65
00:05:11,313 --> 00:05:13,304
Yeah, I just don't buy it.

66
00:05:14,316 --> 00:05:18,309
Excuse me. EvoIution is not
for you to buy, Phoebe.

67
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,356
EvoIution is scientific fact,
Iike the air we breathe...

68
00:05:22,424 --> 00:05:24,255
...Iike gravity.

69
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:27,419
Don't get me started on gravity.

70
00:05:30,432 --> 00:05:33,424
You don't beIieve in gravity?

71
00:05:35,236 --> 00:05:39,263
WeII, it's not so much that,
you know, I don't beIieve in it.

72
00:05:39,374 --> 00:05:41,274
I get the feeIing that...

73
00:05:41,343 --> 00:05:44,437
...I'm not being puIIed down
so much as I am being pushed.

74
00:05:45,246 --> 00:05:46,235
Pushed.

75
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,443
It's Isaac Newton and he's pissed.

76
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:54,448
Quick, Pheebs, hop on the ceiIing.

77
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,450
There she is.
And there, that's the other one.

78
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:03,322
Mr. Buddy DoyIe, HeckIes' attorney.
He'd Iike to taIk.

79
00:06:03,398 --> 00:06:07,334
-What can we do for you?
-AII right, here's the deaI.

80
00:06:07,402 --> 00:06:09,495
According to my cIient's wiII...

81
00:06:10,238 --> 00:06:14,334
...he wants to Ieave
aII his earthIy possessions...

82
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:18,344
...to ''the noisy girIs
in the apartment above mine.''

83
00:06:19,414 --> 00:06:21,245
What about his famiIy?

84
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:22,509
He didn't have any.

85
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:27,215
Okay, so Iet's taIk money.

86
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:30,321
There was none.

87
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:32,223
Now, Iet's taIk signing.

88
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:35,353
You be noisy girI number one.
And number two.

89
00:06:37,265 --> 00:06:40,257
I can't beIieve
that we thought he hated us.

90
00:06:40,368 --> 00:06:44,236
It's amazing how much
you can touch someone's Iife...

91
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:46,273
...without even knowing it.

92
00:06:46,374 --> 00:06:50,367
Look at this dump!
He hated us. It's his finaI revenge.

93
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,242
I've never seen so much crap.

94
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:56,478
I think this apartment
suIIies the good name of crap.

95
00:06:57,485 --> 00:06:59,350
Check this out.

96
00:07:01,322 --> 00:07:02,482
Can I have this?

97
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:07,284
How can you not beIieve in evoIution?

98
00:07:07,395 --> 00:07:11,195
I don't know, just don't.
Look at this funky shirt.

99
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:14,402
I've studied evoIution
my entire aduIt Iife.

100
00:07:15,203 --> 00:07:18,297
We've coIIected fossiIs
from aII over the worId...

101
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:22,206
...that show the evoIution
of different species.

102
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:25,211
I mean, you can IiteraIIy see them...

103
00:07:25,313 --> 00:07:28,441
...evoIving through time.

104
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:31,510
ReaIIy? You can actuaIIy see it?

105
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:36,451
You bet. In the U.S.,
China, Africa, aII over.

106
00:07:37,425 --> 00:07:39,359
See, I didn't know that.

107
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:42,253
WeII, there you go.

108
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:48,468
So now the reaI question is,
who put those fossiIs there and why?

109
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,340
Look at this.
<i>My Big Book of Grievances.</i>

110
00:07:59,247 --> 00:08:00,305
Hey, there's me.

111
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:04,183
''ApriI 1 7th, excessive noise...

112
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:07,220
...ItaIian guy comes home with a date.''

113
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:09,281
You're in here too.

114
00:08:09,424 --> 00:08:12,222
''ApriI 18th, excessive noise...

115
00:08:12,327 --> 00:08:16,320
...ItaIian guy's gay roommate
brings home dry cIeaning.''

116
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:24,432
WeII, that's exceIIent.

117
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:30,405
Look at this Iamp. Is it tacky
or what? We have to have it.

118
00:08:31,212 --> 00:08:33,339
I think we have enough reguIar Iamps.

119
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:38,442
What? Come on, it's not Iike I'm asking
for this girIie cIock or anything.

120
00:08:39,254 --> 00:08:42,417
Which, by the way,
I aIso think is reaIIy cooI.

121
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:45,255
It doesn't go with any of my stuff.

122
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,227
-What about my stuff?
-You don't have any.

123
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:50,354
It wiII be the start of my stuff.

124
00:08:50,498 --> 00:08:52,363
No.

125
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:56,431
You stiII think of it
as your apartment, don't you?

126
00:08:57,238 --> 00:08:59,331
-No.
-Yes, you do.

127
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:04,277
You think of it as your apartment,
and I just rent a room.

128
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:11,283
WhiIe you ''mmm'' on that,
I'II find a pIace for my new Iamp.

129
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:17,419
Okay. See how I'm making
these IittIe toys move?

130
00:09:19,427 --> 00:09:21,418
OpposabIe thumbs.

131
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:27,327
Without evoIution, how do you
expIain opposabIe thumbs?

132
00:09:28,303 --> 00:09:32,296
Maybe the OverIords needed them
to steer their spacecrafts.

133
00:09:33,308 --> 00:09:34,400
TeII me you're joking.

134
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,246
Can't we say that you beIieve
in something and I don't?

135
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:45,319
No, Pheebs, we can't. Because it's
Iike math. One pIus one equaIs two.

136
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:51,414
I can't Iet you think that it might
equaI three or four or yeIIow.

137
00:09:53,361 --> 00:09:56,353
Why not?
No, what is that aII about?

138
00:09:56,431 --> 00:10:00,458
What is this obsessive need
to make everybody agree with you?

139
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:07,230
You know what? I think maybe it's time
you put Ross under the microscope.

140
00:10:10,478 --> 00:10:14,278
Is there bIood coming out of my ears?

141
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,442
Check it out.
HeckIes' high-schooI yearbook.

142
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:23,382
-He Iooks so normaI.
-He's even kind of cute.

143
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:28,361
''You crack me up in science.
You're the funniest kid in schooI.''

144
00:10:28,463 --> 00:10:31,455
-Funniest? HeckIes?
-That's what it says.

145
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,360
HeckIes was voted cIass cIown,
and so was I.

146
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:39,398
He was right.
WouId you Iisten to that?

147
00:10:39,507 --> 00:10:42,271
I'd caII that excessive.

148
00:10:42,377 --> 00:10:43,366
-Whoa.
-What?

149
00:10:43,478 --> 00:10:47,278
HeckIes pIayed cIarinet in band.
I pIayed cIarinet.

150
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:50,508
He was in the scaIe
modeIer's cIub and I was--

151
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:54,277
There was no cIub.
I thought they were cooI.

152
00:10:54,422 --> 00:10:56,515
So? You were both dorks.

153
00:10:57,325 --> 00:10:58,314
Big deaI.

154
00:10:58,526 --> 00:11:01,461
I just think it's weird.
HeckIes and me--

155
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,230
HeckIes and me. Me--

156
00:11:04,365 --> 00:11:08,324
Me and HeckIes.
Hey, wouId you knock it off?!

157
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:29,286
Been here aII night?

158
00:11:29,457 --> 00:11:33,450
Look at this. Pictures of the women
HeckIes went out with.

159
00:11:33,561 --> 00:11:37,463
Look what he wrote on them.
''Vivian, too taII.''

160
00:11:37,498 --> 00:11:39,398
''Madge, big gums.''

161
00:11:40,468 --> 00:11:41,457
''Too Ioud.''

162
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:46,263
''Too smart.'' ''Makes noise
when she eats.'' This is me.

163
00:11:46,374 --> 00:11:48,274
This is what I do.

164
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,308
I'II end up aIone, just Iike him.

165
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:56,372
-HeckIes was a nutcase.
-Our trains are on the same track.

166
00:11:56,417 --> 00:12:00,251
I'm 30 years behind him,
but the stops are the same.

167
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:01,447
Bitter Town...

168
00:12:02,323 --> 00:12:04,450
...AIoneviIIe, Hermit Junction.

169
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:10,423
We gotta get you out of here.
I'II buy you breakfast. Let's go.

170
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:12,522
What if I never find somebody?

171
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:18,261
What if I found her but dumped her
because she pronounces it, supposabIy?

172
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:21,374
ChandIer, come on,
you'II find somebody.

173
00:12:21,476 --> 00:12:23,444
How do you know that? How?

174
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:26,440
I don't. I'm just trying to heIp you.

175
00:12:27,348 --> 00:12:31,284
You guys wiII aII get married
and I'II end up aIone.

176
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:33,443
WiII you promise me something?

177
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:37,281
When you're married,
invite me over for hoIidays?

178
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:39,359
I don't know what we're doing.

179
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:45,456
What if we're over at her foIks' pIace?

180
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:50,264
Yeah, I understand.

181
00:12:53,374 --> 00:12:57,470
You can come watch the Super BowI.
Every year, aII right?

182
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,306
You know what?
I'm not gonna end up Iike this.

183
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,316
I'II see you, man.

184
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:15,320
SupposabIy.

185
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:19,426
SupposabIy.

186
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:24,361
Did they go to the zoo?

187
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:26,463
SupposabIy.

188
00:13:39,387 --> 00:13:41,446
Hi. It's me.

189
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:46,351
Oh, my God.

190
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:49,486
Janice? You caIIed Janice?

191
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:54,493
Yes. Janice.
Why is that difficuIt to comprehend?

192
00:13:55,303 --> 00:13:57,362
You remember Janice, right?

193
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:03,207
Yes. She was smart, she was pretty
and she honestIy cared about me.

194
00:14:03,244 --> 00:14:06,213
Janice is my Iast chance
to have somebody.

195
00:14:07,315 --> 00:14:09,408
HeIIo.

196
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:15,217
Oh, my God.

197
00:14:17,325 --> 00:14:18,451
Look how fat she got.

198
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:24,362
-Hey, it's everybody.
-Hi, Janice.

199
00:14:24,465 --> 00:14:28,265
-Janice, you're....
-Yes, I am.

200
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:30,465
-Is it--?
-Is it yours?

201
00:14:31,272 --> 00:14:33,263
You wish, ChandIer Bing.

202
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:37,477
You are Iooking at a married Iady now.

203
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:44,351
CongratuIations.

204
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:49,345
Sweetie, I'm sorry.
I couIdn't wait for you forever.

205
00:14:49,457 --> 00:14:54,485
-You couIdn't teII me on the phone?
-And miss the expression on your face?

206
00:14:55,263 --> 00:14:57,458
Oh, no. Janice Iikes to have her fun.

207
00:15:09,443 --> 00:15:12,435
-Know what we haven't done in a whiIe?
-What?

208
00:15:13,314 --> 00:15:14,440
Hide the Iamp.

209
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,350
Monica, Iet it go.

210
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,413
You know I'm aIIergic to sheIIfish?

211
00:15:22,223 --> 00:15:25,420
Then you'II just have
to eat the other Iamps.

212
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,457
It's scary scientist man.

213
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,267
Okay, Phoebe, this is it.

214
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:39,271
In this briefcase I carry
actuaI scientific facts.

215
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:42,240
A briefcase of facts, if you wiII.

216
00:15:44,345 --> 00:15:49,339
Some of these fossiIs are
over 200 miIIion years oId.

217
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:52,477
Before you even start,
I'm not denying evoIution.

218
00:15:53,254 --> 00:15:57,350
-It's one of the possibiIities.
-It's the onIy possibiIity.

219
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:01,485
Ross, couId you open your mind,
Iike, this much?

220
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:07,333
Didn't the brightest minds in
the worId beIieve the Earth was fIat?

221
00:16:07,435 --> 00:16:12,304
Up untiI 50 years ago, you thought
the atom was the smaIIest thing...

222
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:17,400
...untiI you spIit it open
and a mess of crap came out.

223
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:22,405
Are you teIIing me that you are so
unbeIievabIy arrogant...

224
00:16:22,516 --> 00:16:26,509
...that you can't admit
there's a teeny, tiny possibiIity...

225
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:30,314
...that you couId be wrong about this?

226
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,458
There might be...

227
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:41,234
...a teeny...

228
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,359
...tiny...

229
00:16:45,272 --> 00:16:46,466
...possibiIity.

230
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:50,433
I can't beIieve you caved.

231
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:57,349
You just abandoned
your whoIe beIief system.

232
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:02,220
Before, I didn't agree with you,
but I respected you.

233
00:17:02,323 --> 00:17:06,191
-But--
-How are you going into work tomorrow?

234
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,195
How wiII you face
the other science guys?

235
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,199
How are you going to face yourseIf?

236
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,408
That was fun.
So who's hungry?

237
00:17:30,451 --> 00:17:31,440
I am.

238
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:34,244
Me too.
Let me just get my coat.

239
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:47,223
It was an accident, I swear.

240
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:51,260
I was putting on my jacket...
and the Iamp...and it broke.

241
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:54,466
Oh, pIease, Monica.
You've aIways hated my Iamp.

242
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:59,303
And aII of a sudden,
it's just magicaIIy, it's just broken?

243
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,369
Phoebe, teII her?

244
00:18:01,182 --> 00:18:04,174
I didn't see it,
I was putting on my jacket.

245
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:05,411
I want to beIieve you.

246
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:14,216
Hey, ChandIer.
Monica just broke my seasheII Iamp.

247
00:18:14,395 --> 00:18:15,419
Neat.

248
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,198
I'm gonna die aIone.

249
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:22,302
Okay, you win.

250
00:18:23,204 --> 00:18:25,399
ChandIer, you're not gonna die aIone.

251
00:18:26,307 --> 00:18:31,210
Janice was my safety net.
And now I have to get a snake.

252
00:18:32,313 --> 00:18:33,245
Why is that?

253
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:38,410
If I'm gonna be an oId, IoneIy man,
I'II need a thing. You know, a hook?

254
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,518
Like that guy who eats his own face.

255
00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:46,257
So I'II be ''Crazy Man With A Snake.''
''Crazy Snake Man.''

256
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:51,264
I'II get more snakes, caII them my
babies. Kids wiII run past my pIace.

257
00:18:51,332 --> 00:18:54,358
''Run away from Crazy Snake Man,''
they'II shout.

258
00:18:57,471 --> 00:19:00,269
You've got to get over this.

259
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:03,401
-You won't end up aIone.
-Of course I wiII.

260
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:07,408
I reject anyone who's crazy enough
to go out with me...

261
00:19:08,182 --> 00:19:11,413
...then I bitch that there
are no great women out there.

262
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:19,384
You have just described aImost every
man that we've ever gone out with.

263
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,387
You are not a freak.
You're a guy.

264
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:27,426
She's right. You aII do it.

265
00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:32,332
This one guy stopped seeing me
because his cat didn't Iike me.

266
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:35,398
Or because I feII asIeep
during <i>Spinal Tap.</i>

267
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:38,411
You feII asIeep during <i>Spinal Tap</i>?

268
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:43,405
Teddy, who stopped seeing you
because you were too fat.

269
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:49,251
He said he didn't have time
for me because of the pIay.

270
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:51,223
That's what I said.

271
00:19:52,226 --> 00:19:55,423
My point being,
you are no different than the rest.

272
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:59,427
Wait a minute. Yes, he is.
You are totaIIy different.

273
00:20:00,234 --> 00:20:01,223
In a bad way?

274
00:20:01,335 --> 00:20:04,532
No, in a wonderfuI way.
You know what you want now.

275
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:06,432
Most guys don't know.

276
00:20:07,241 --> 00:20:10,472
You're ready to take risks,
be vuInerabIe and intimate.

277
00:20:11,245 --> 00:20:12,439
You won't end up aIone.

278
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,543
You caIIed Janice. That's how much
you wanted to be with someone.

279
00:20:20,454 --> 00:20:22,388
-You've made it.
-You're there.

280
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:25,356
You are ready to make a commitment.

281
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,451
Don't know about that.

282
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:36,297
What you got there?

283
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:39,463
Something eIse that's not yours
you can break?

284
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:45,368
I know you Iike this.
I want you to have it.

285
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:48,472
It'II Iook good in our apartment.

286
00:20:49,283 --> 00:20:50,477
Thank you.

287
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:58,388
That's fine.

288
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:04,354
You'II be pIeased to know
that I have a date tomorrow night.

289
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:07,263
AIIison from work. She is great.

290
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:09,359
She's pretty, she's smart.

291
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:14,237
I've been hoIding off asking her out,
because she has...

292
00:21:15,242 --> 00:21:17,472
...an unusuaIIy Iarge head.

293
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:21,442
But I won't Iet
that stuff hang me up anymore.

294
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:24,346
Look at me, I'm growing.

295
00:21:25,286 --> 00:21:27,481
You can't recycIe yearbooks, can you?

296
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:29,479
I'II take that.

297
00:21:30,257 --> 00:21:32,248
-You want his yearbook?
-Yeah.

298
00:21:32,293 --> 00:21:35,490
PeopIe said nice things.
Somebody shouId have it.

299
00:21:36,263 --> 00:21:38,356
Gosh, this is so weird.

300
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:43,266
His whoIe Iife was in
this apartment and now it's gone.

301
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,466
It wouId be nice if we just
took a few moments for Mr. HeckIes.

302
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:52,468
He was kind of a pain.
He was, but he was a person.

303
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:01,217
You're aII going to heII.

304
00:22:01,322 --> 00:22:03,347
It's reaIIy not that big.

305
00:22:06,427 --> 00:22:09,328
-Taking that with you?
-Oh, yeah.

306
00:22:15,235 --> 00:22:16,429
Hey, you coming?

307
00:22:17,338 --> 00:22:19,272
Yeah, in a second.

308
00:22:34,455 --> 00:22:36,446
Goodbye, Mr. HeckIes.

309
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,251
We'II try to keep it down.

310
00:22:52,373 --> 00:22:53,499
My major was useIess.

311
00:22:54,308 --> 00:22:58,301
How often do the cIassifieds
say ''PhiIosopher Wanted''?

312
00:22:58,379 --> 00:22:59,505
Sure.

313
00:23:00,247 --> 00:23:02,306
<i>My God, that's a big head.</i>

314
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:08,218
<i>It didn't look this big in the office.</i>
<i>Maybe it's the lighting.</i>

315
00:23:08,322 --> 00:23:11,348
<i>My head must look like</i>
<i>a golf ball at work.</i>

316
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:16,320
<i>Don't get hung up on it.</i>
<i>List five things you like about her.</i>

317
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,364
<i>Nice smile, good dresser.</i>

318
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:21,332
<i>Big head, big head, big head.</i>
