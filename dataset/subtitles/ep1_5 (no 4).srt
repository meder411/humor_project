1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:04,369
This is pretty much
what's happened so far.

2
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:07,438
<i>Ross was in love</i>
<i>with Rachel forever.</i>

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:13,240
<i>When he tried to tell her, things got</i>
<i>in the way. Like cats, Italian guys.</i>

4
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,339
<i>Finally, Chandler said,</i>
<i>''Forget about her. ''</i>

5
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:21,284
<i>When Ross was in China, Chandler</i>
<i>let it slip that Ross loved Rachel.</i>

6
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,288
<i>She said, ''Oh, my God!''</i>

7
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:26,291
<i>So she went to the airport</i>
<i>to meet him.</i>

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,261
<i>She didn't know Ross</i>
<i>was with another woman.</i>

9
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,491
That's everything you need to know.

10
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,360
Enough about us.
How've you been?

11
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,460
The One With Ross' New GirIfriend

12
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,342
<i>Flight number 257</i>
<i>from Beijing now arriving.</i>

13
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,447
Oh, my God.

14
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,451
Oh, my God.

15
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:35,556
Excuse me.

16
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,457
Move, move, move!
Emergency, pIease!

17
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,357
Excuse me.

18
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:50,467
There you are.

19
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:56,277
So, so....

20
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,283
How was China?
You!

21
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,454
It was great. What happened?

22
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:04,416
-You're bIeeding.
-I am?

23
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,425
Oh, Iook at that! Yes, I am.

24
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,326
Enough of me,
Mr. Back-from-the-Orient.

25
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:13,331
Come on, I wanna hear everything!
Everything!

26
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,334
WeII, where do I start?

27
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:20,372
This is JuIie.
JuIie, this is RacheI.

28
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,470
These are....
These are...

29
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,340
...aren't for you.

30
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,343
These are for you.

31
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,386
WeIcome to our country.

32
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:40,483
Thank you. I'm from New York!

33
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:47,262
No probIem. We'II use them
to stop the bIeeding.

34
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,567
-Baggage cIaim?
-Okay.

35
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,344
She went to the airport.
She's going for it with Ross.

36
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:05,316
Oh, my God! This is huge!

37
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,210
This is bigger than huge.
This is....

38
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,313
AII right, what's bigger than huge?

39
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:13,357
-This?
-Yes.

40
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,421
You got new haircuts.

41
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:19,454
Yes, we did.
Thanks to VidaI Buffay.

42
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,431
Because, ''If you don't Iook good,
we don't Iook good.''

43
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,461
I Iove that voice.

44
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:32,240
Here. And the winner is Ava Gardner.

45
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,369
You guys.

46
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:39,274
Airport. Airport. Ross. Not aIone.

47
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,478
JuIie. Arm around her.

48
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,358
Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!

49
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,293
I think she's trying to say something.

50
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,353
Quick, get the verbs.

51
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,459
You! You!

52
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,293
You said he Iiked me! You!

53
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,496
You sIowpokes!

54
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,401
That's aII right.
We got the bags.

55
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:06,210
-Hi. HeIIo.
-Hi, honey.

56
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,212
This is my sister, Monica.

57
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,315
This is ChandIer. Phoebe, hi.

58
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,317
-Joey, what up?
-HeIIo.

59
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,211
Everyone, this is JuIie.

60
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,449
JuIie.

61
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,331
I'm not here.
We haven't met.

62
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:29,367
I make a better impression
without 20 hours of pIane on me.

63
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,233
-And bus.
-Oh, my God!

64
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,329
-The screaming guy--
-The spitting.

65
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,237
You gotta hear this.

66
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,435
We're on this 200-year-oId bus.

67
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:40,269
At Ieast 200.

68
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,349
And the chicken poops in her Iap.

69
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,357
I'm so sorry.

70
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,382
I just gave away the ending.

71
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,360
I just heard this story in the cab...

72
00:04:56,462 --> 00:05:00,228
...and it is aII I can think about.

73
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,427
This is amazing.

74
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:08,332
-How did this happen?
-We were in grad schooI together.

75
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,502
Haven't seen each other since.
I Iand in China.

76
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,213
Guess who's in charge?

77
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,248
JuIie!

78
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,308
Isn't that great?

79
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:23,348
Isn't it just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

80
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,416
It's an expression.

81
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,453
We just wanted to say a quick hi.

82
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,425
-Then we'II see the baby.
-Then get sIeep.

83
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,530
It's 6:00 tomorrow, our time.

84
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,363
Don't teII us what wiII happen.
I Iike surprises.

85
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,436
Bye!

86
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,548
-Can I get some coffee?
-Sure.

87
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,290
-You taIk to him yet?
-No.

88
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,418
Then, no.

89
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,400
What happened to you in China?

90
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:21,213
When Iast we Ieft,
you were in Iove with....

91
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,210
I know I was.

92
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,251
But there was this voice
that kept saying...

93
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:31,221
...''It'II never happen. Move on.''
You know whose voice it was?

94
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,348
God?

95
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,224
It was you, paI.

96
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,229
Maybe it was God doing me.

97
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:43,531
Aside from being aImighty,
he's a wiz at doing voices.

98
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:48,239
You were right. She Iooks
at me as a friend. That's aII.

99
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,235
Then I met JuIie, and we're
having a great time.

100
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:57,476
I never wouId've gone for it with her,
if not for you.

101
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,311
WeII, you owe me one, big guy.

102
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,210
Your Iemonade.

103
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,313
Didn't order it.

104
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:09,284
Then go take that back.
They'II charge you.

105
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:12,193
Go, go, go. Come on, come on.

106
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,291
So, what'd you find out?

107
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:18,294
He said....

108
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,235
He said....

109
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:27,302
He said they're having
a great time. I'm sorry.

110
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,214
The siIver Iining,
if you wanna see it...

111
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:34,343
...is that he made this decision
by himseIf...

112
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,412
...without any outside heIp
whatsoever.

113
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,517
How is that a siIver Iining?

114
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,421
You have to reaIIy wanna see it.

115
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:53,270
IronicaIIy, these guys
were picked Iast in gym.

116
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:54,464
Hey, Pheebs.

117
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:58,243
-You know what I'm thinking?
-Oh, okay.

118
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,279
How...

119
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,215
...it's been so Iong
since you've had sex...

120
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,413
...you're wondering
if they've changed it?

121
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,383
Not even cIose.

122
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:17,192
No. AIthough now
that's what I'm thinking.

123
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,296
What were you thinking?

124
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,392
You gave the guys great haircuts.
I thought you couId do mine.

125
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,338
Oh. No.

126
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:29,196
Why not?

127
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,208
Because I'm just....

128
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,404
I'm incredibIy anaI,
an unbeIievabIe controI freak.

129
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:38,315
-No, you're not.
-I know I'm not, but you are.

130
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,345
I was trying to spare your feeIings.

131
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,419
HoId on.
Ross, JuIie for you.

132
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:57,334
Excuse me.
Who gave her our phone number?

133
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:01,270
Okay, weII....
Who had the motive?

134
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,400
Was it the actor?

135
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,372
The chef? The masseuse?

136
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,172
Or was it the guy who's dating her?

137
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,319
Guy who's dating her.

138
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,385
Hey.
Anybody know a good taiIor?

139
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,223
Need cIothes aItered?

140
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:26,288
No, I'm Iooking for a man
to draw on me with chaIk.

141
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,425
See Frankie. My famiIy's been
going to him forever.

142
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:34,298
He did my first suit when I was 1 5.
No, wait, 1 6.

143
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:38,241
No, excuse me, 1 5.

144
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,404
AII right, when was 1 990?

145
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,445
Stop the Q-Tip
when there's resistance.

146
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,328
Okay. Okay.
Sweetheart, I'II see you Iater.

147
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,422
Okay, bye.

148
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,327
That is so sweet.

149
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,231
Okay. No, you hang up.

150
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,367
No, you--

151
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,246
One, two, three.

152
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,440
You didn't either.

153
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,480
She didn't hang up.

154
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,384
No, you hang up.

155
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,258
You. You.

156
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:43,264
Sorry, I thought
you were taIking to me.

157
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,466
RacheI.

158
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,313
I'II just caII her back.

159
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,507
I'm sorry. We got disconnected.

160
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,478
No, you hang up.

161
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,321
How did this happen to me?

162
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,324
A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.

163
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,223
Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.

164
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,525
Now aII of a sudden, he's Ross...

165
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:10,358
...this reaIIy great guy
that I can't have.

166
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:13,336
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.

167
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,236
I know you did.

168
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,467
Hey, you wanna hit ChandIer again?

169
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:22,278
I'm just gonna deaI with it.

170
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,444
I gotta get out of here.

171
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:34,452
I don't care what you say.
Something's bothering her.

172
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,493
You know, I think I was 1 6.

173
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:47,472
You know, I think I don't care.

174
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,474
PIease, just a IittIe bit
off the back?

175
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,306
I'm stiII on ''no.''

176
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:55,402
Morning.

177
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,473
CouId you cIose your eyes?

178
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:02,213
No, no, no.
I'm not faIIing for that again.

179
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:07,419
-What's going on?
-I did a stupid thing Iast night.

180
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,428
What stupid thing?

181
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:21,262
PaoIo, now you've seen everybody
and they've aII seen you.

182
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:25,469
How did this happen?

183
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,337
I kind of ran into him Iast night.

184
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,372
-Where?
-His apartment. Is this juice?

185
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:35,549
Whoa, the fact that you dumped him
because he hit on Phoebe?

186
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:39,451
Oh, God, I know.
I'm pathetic, I'm a Ioser.

187
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,453
You're not pathetic.
You're just sad.

188
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,293
Upset peopIe do stupid things.

189
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:49,494
If I had a nickeI
for every guy I wish I hadn't--

190
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:56,273
But this is
about your horribIe mistake.

191
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,345
Sorry we're Iate.
We were....

192
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,405
WeII, there was touching.

193
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,356
-Hey, Ross.
-Hey, PaoIo.

194
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,351
What, uh...?

195
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,219
What are you doing here?

196
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,230
I do RaqueI.

197
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,272
So he's back?

198
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:31,241
Yeah, he's back.
Is that a probIem?

199
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:32,435
No, not a probIem.

200
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,236
Good. GIad it's not a probIem.

201
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,449
You're gonna have to not touch my ass.

202
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:46,288
WeII, despite the yummy bageIs
and paIpabIe tension...

203
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,360
...my pants need to be aItered.

204
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:52,353
When you see Frankie,
teII him Joey Tribbiani says heIIo.

205
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,389
He'II know what it means.

206
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:59,368
You sure he'II crack that code?

207
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:04,436
It's funny. The Iast time PaoIo
was here, my hair was so much cuter.

208
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,336
AII right.

209
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,442
You have to promise that you
wiII not be controI-y and bossy...

210
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,209
...and aII Monica about it.

211
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,323
-I promise.
-AII right, Iet's see.

212
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:22,418
Now, some of you are gonna get cut
and some of you aren't.

213
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:27,355
But I promise
none of you wiII feeI a thing.

214
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:43,345
-That's it. I quit.
-What? I didn't say anything.

215
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:47,250
This isn't the face
of a person who trusts a person.

216
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,288
This is the face of a person who...

217
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,381
...doesn't trust a person.

218
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,290
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

219
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:59,296
It's just a IittIe shorter
than what we had discussed.

220
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,425
WouId you reIax?
I know what I am doing.

221
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,397
This is how he wears it.

222
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,239
-How who wears it?
-Demi Moore.

223
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,311
Demi Moore is not a ''he.''

224
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:16,246
WeII, he was a ''he''
in <i>Arthur</i> and in <i>10.</i>

225
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,443
That's DudIey Moore.

226
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,447
I said I wanted it Iike Demi Moore.

227
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,412
Oh, my God.

228
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,414
Oh, God.

229
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,321
Oh, my God! I'm sorry!

230
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,228
Which is Demi Moore?

231
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:38,235
She's the actress that was in
<i>Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost.</i>

232
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,463
She's got gorgeous hair.

233
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,228
I know.

234
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,275
I wanted to Iook Iike her.

235
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:50,474
-You know, my mom's dead.
-Oh, my God.

236
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:01,482
WeII, this is what my butt
must Iook Iike to a fIy.

237
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:08,289
-How Iong do you want the cuffs?
-At Ieast as Iong as I have the pants.

238
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,203
I just got that.

239
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:20,207
Now we'II do your inseam.

240
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:37,225
-How is she?
-It's too soon to teII.

241
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,458
She's resting, which is a good sign.

242
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:43,223
How's the hair?

243
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:46,429
I'm not gonna Iie to you.
It doesn't Iook good.

244
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:56,246
-There's nothing you can do?
-At this point, it's a waiting game.

245
00:16:56,382 --> 00:17:00,375
I put a cIip on one side,
which seems to stop the curIing.

246
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,378
Can we see her?

247
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:06,289
Your hair Iooks too good.
It wouId upset her.

248
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,259
Ross, why don't you come on in?

249
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:18,267
-WeII, how you doing?
-I'm okay.

250
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,498
-That bad, huh?
-What?

251
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,437
I can sense when women
are depressed and vuInerabIe.

252
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,405
It's one of my gifts.

253
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:35,319
Joey, when I saw him
get off that pIane with her...

254
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:38,356
...I reaIIy thought
I hit rock bottom.

255
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,318
But today, it's Iike
there's rock bottom...

256
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,419
...50 feet of crap...

257
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,260
...then me.

258
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,264
TeII Ross how you feeI.

259
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,360
How can I just teII him?
What about JuIie?

260
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,430
What about her?
It's onIy been two weeks.

261
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,233
Ross has been in Iove
with you for 10 years.

262
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,275
I don't know. I don't know.

263
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,179
I've been with my share of women.

264
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,378
I've been with a Iot
of peopIe's share of women.

265
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,219
But the point is...

266
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:16,386
...I've never feIt about anyone
the way Ross feIt about you.

267
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,193
ReaIIy?

268
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,304
Yo, <i>paesan.</i>

269
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,210
Can I taIk to you for a sec?

270
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,245
Your taiIor...

271
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,409
...is a very bad man.

272
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,321
What are you taIking about?

273
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,356
Hey, what's going on?

274
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,421
Joey's taiIor...

275
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,527
...took advantage of me.

276
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,268
-What?
-No way.

277
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:05,207
-I've been going to him for years.
-He said he was doing my inseam.

278
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:09,179
Then he ran his hand up my Ieg
and there was definite--

279
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,270
What?

280
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,376
Cupping.

281
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,287
That's how they do pants.

282
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,316
First, they go up one side,
they move it over.

283
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:27,421
Then, up the other side,
move it back. Then they do the rear.

284
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,395
Isn't that how a taiIor
measures pants?

285
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:36,231
Yes, yes, it is.
In prison.

286
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,215
What's the matter with you?

287
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,305
What?

288
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,444
That's not?

289
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:57,353
Oh, my God.

290
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,428
I'II put on a pot of coffee.

291
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:13,277
Even Mary TyIer Moore
wouId've been better.

292
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,372
Come on. It's not that bad.
You never know.

293
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,350
BeII-bottoms came back.

294
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,479
I Iike it.

295
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,448
I do. I think it's a 10.

296
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,350
Thank you.

297
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,293
My hair is amused.

298
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,457
Come on, things couId be worse.

299
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:38,458
You couId ''get caught between
the moon and New York City.''

300
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:43,407
''It's crazy, but it's true.''

301
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,503
Thank you.

302
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,372
WeII, I gotta go. Bye.

303
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,383
-Bye, Rach.
-Wait, are you Ieaving?

304
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,317
That's what I meant by ''bye.''

305
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:59,323
-Can I taIk to you for a sec?
-Okay.

306
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:04,318
When the doctor does
that hernia test....

307
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,424
That's okay.

308
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:13,333
If your mechanic does it....

309
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,273
What's going on?

310
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:23,439
WeII, okay, first of aII...

311
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,478
...PaoIo and I are not back together.

312
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,243
That was a stupid thing I did.

313
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,346
If I couId go back in time
and do it again...

314
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,448
...weII, I wouIdn't.

315
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,259
Second of aII....

316
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:40,487
What?

317
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:47,461
Is this one of those things
where you break up with a guy...

318
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:52,305
...I teII you what I think,
you get back together with him...

319
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:55,312
-...and I Iook Iike a compIete idiot?
-No.

320
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,507
WeII, then, I think the guy's scum.

321
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,413
I hate him. I actuaIIy--
I physicaIIy hate him.

322
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,315
I aIways have.

323
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:10,317
And you are way too good
to be with a guy Iike that.

324
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,321
ReaIIy?

325
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,461
You deserve someone
who appreciates you...

326
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:20,432
...and who gets how funny
and sweet and amazing...

327
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:24,231
...and adorabIe and sexy you are.

328
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,471
You know? Someone who wakes up
every morning thinking...

329
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,475
...''Oh, my God. I'm with RacheI.''

330
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,451
You know?
Someone who makes you feeI good.

331
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,278
Like the way I do with JuIie.

332
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,359
Was there a ''second of aII''?

333
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:54,370
No, I think that was the whoIe ''aII.''

334
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,469
I gotta go. Okay. Okay.

335
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:02,506
-Okay.
-Okay.

336
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,314
No, I swear to God, Dad.
That's not how they measure pants.

337
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:23,265
I was thinking shorter,
Iike Andie MacDoweII's haircut.

338
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,462
-Yeah, I couId do that.
-ReaIIy?

339
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:27,533
-You wanna do it now?
-Great!

340
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:31,434
See you.

341
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:35,378
I just wanna make
reaIIy sure this time.

342
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:40,350
Andie MacDoweII is the girI from
<i>Four Weddings and a Funeral,</i> right?

343
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:42,275
No.

344
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,254
That's Roddy McDowaII.

345
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,260
Andie MacDoweII is the guy
from <i>Planet of the Apes.</i>

346
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,393
-Oh, yeah. Thank you.
-You're weIcome.

347
00:24:07,764 --> 00:24:10,790
These were expensive,
and he'II grow out of them...

348
00:24:11,568 --> 00:24:14,594
...in, Iike, 20 minutes,
but I couIdn't resist.

349
00:24:17,607 --> 00:24:19,666
Look at these.

350
00:24:19,776 --> 00:24:22,677
Hey, Ben. ''Just do it.''

351
00:24:24,781 --> 00:24:25,805
Oh, my God.

352
00:24:26,616 --> 00:24:29,676
Was that too much
pressure for him?

353
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,813
-Wow, is he hungry aIready?
-I guess so.

354
00:24:34,624 --> 00:24:35,784
You know, it's--

355
00:24:38,795 --> 00:24:42,595
Something funny about sneakers.
I'II be right back.

356
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,794
I gotta get one too.

357
00:24:47,738 --> 00:24:49,706
Hey, what are you guys doing?

358
00:24:49,806 --> 00:24:52,741
We're just hanging out
by the spoons.

359
00:24:52,843 --> 00:24:54,606
LadIe?

360
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:58,738
WiII you grow up? This is the
most beautifuI thing in the worId.

361
00:24:58,849 --> 00:25:01,750
We know.
But there's a baby sucking on it.

362
00:25:04,554 --> 00:25:09,651
This is my son having Iunch, okay?
It'II happen a Iot so get used to it.

363
00:25:09,693 --> 00:25:14,756
If you're uncomfortabIe, just ask
questions. CaroI's fine with it.

364
00:25:17,801 --> 00:25:20,668
-CaroI?
-CaroI?

365
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:27,574
I was just wondering if Joey couId ask
you a question about breast-feeding?

366
00:25:27,811 --> 00:25:29,574
Sure.

367
00:25:31,681 --> 00:25:32,773
Does it hurt?

368
00:25:34,584 --> 00:25:36,677
It did at first, but not anymore.

369
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,809
ChandIer?

370
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:42,782
So how often can you do it?

371
00:25:43,727 --> 00:25:44,819
As much as he needs.

372
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:48,697
Okay, I got one, I got one.

373
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,602
If he bIows into one, does
the other one get bigger?

374
00:25:54,704 --> 00:25:56,695
The One With the Breast MiIk

375
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:44,586
Do you have muffins Ieft?

376
00:26:44,621 --> 00:26:47,784
-Yeah, I forget which ones.
-You're busy. I'II get it.

377
00:26:47,891 --> 00:26:50,724
-Anyone eIse want one?
-No, thanks.

378
00:26:51,595 --> 00:26:54,587
You're Iosing your apron.
Let me get it.

379
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:56,632
-There you go.
-Thank you.

380
00:26:58,602 --> 00:26:59,796
What a bitch!

381
00:27:02,772 --> 00:27:06,572
I have a friend at
BIoomingdaIe's who's quitting...

382
00:27:06,643 --> 00:27:08,736
...and wants to abuse his discount.

383
00:27:08,778 --> 00:27:11,542
Want to come
take advantage of it?

384
00:27:11,681 --> 00:27:15,583
Oh, I can't. I have to take my
grandmother to the vet.

385
00:27:18,788 --> 00:27:20,756
-I'II go with you.
-Great.

386
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,560
-Hi, honey.
-Hey, sweetums.

387
00:27:26,663 --> 00:27:28,688
And heIIo to the rest.

388
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:35,766
Monica, you can't go shopping
with her. What about RacheI?

389
00:27:35,805 --> 00:27:39,673
-WiII it be a probIem?
-BIoomingdaIe's with JuIie?

390
00:27:39,776 --> 00:27:43,712
It's Iike cheating on RacheI
in her house of worship.

391
00:27:44,714 --> 00:27:46,682
Monica, she wiII kiII you.

392
00:27:47,784 --> 00:27:51,686
She wiII kiII you
Iike a dog in the street!

393
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:58,788
JuIes teIIs me you guys
are going shopping tomorrow.

394
00:27:59,729 --> 00:28:04,632
-It's actuaIIy not that big a deaI--
-It is to me. This is great.

395
00:28:04,734 --> 00:28:06,725
I reaIIy appreciate this.

396
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,635
You're weIcome.

397
00:28:23,587 --> 00:28:24,645
Bijan for men?

398
00:28:25,755 --> 00:28:27,552
Bijan for men?

399
00:28:27,657 --> 00:28:28,851
Bijan for men?

400
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,660
-Hey, AnnabeI.
-Hey, Joey.

401
00:28:32,762 --> 00:28:34,787
-You hear about the new guy?
-Who?

402
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:40,696
Nobody knows his name. Me and
the girIs caII him ''the <i>Hombre</i> Man.''

403
00:28:49,579 --> 00:28:50,671
<i>Hombre</i>?

404
00:28:55,619 --> 00:28:57,678
What's he doing in my section?

405
00:28:57,787 --> 00:29:01,518
-I guess he doesn't know.
-WeII, he's gonna.

406
00:29:02,626 --> 00:29:05,527
I'II see you a IittIe Iater, okay?

407
00:29:07,731 --> 00:29:09,631
Hey, how you doing?

408
00:29:09,733 --> 00:29:11,633
Mornin'.

409
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:17,538
Listen, I know you're new but it's
understood that everything from...

410
00:29:17,574 --> 00:29:20,668
...young men's to
the escaIator is my territory.

411
00:29:22,646 --> 00:29:24,637
Your territory?

412
00:29:25,749 --> 00:29:27,649
-Bijan for men?
-No, thanks.

413
00:29:27,751 --> 00:29:29,548
<i>Hombre</i>?

414
00:29:29,653 --> 00:29:31,780
Yeah, aII right.

415
00:29:38,595 --> 00:29:40,586
You were saying?

416
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:47,603
Listen. You were with me,
and we were shopping aII day.

417
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:49,763
-What?
-We shopped and had Iunch.

418
00:29:50,573 --> 00:29:51,767
AII right. What did I have?

419
00:29:52,575 --> 00:29:56,602
-You had a saIad.
-No wonder I don't feeI fuII.

420
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,704
Hi! What's up?

421
00:29:58,581 --> 00:30:00,708
We went shopping, and I had a saIad.

422
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,545
Good, Pheebs.
What'd you buy?

423
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:09,521
We went shopping for....

424
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:10,715
For....

425
00:30:11,561 --> 00:30:13,620
For fur.

426
00:30:15,665 --> 00:30:18,532
You went shopping for fur?

427
00:30:19,636 --> 00:30:25,632
And then I reaIized that I'm against
that. So then we bought some....

428
00:30:27,544 --> 00:30:27,839
Boobs.

429
00:30:33,783 --> 00:30:35,774
You bought boobs?

430
00:30:38,555 --> 00:30:39,681
Bras!

431
00:30:40,657 --> 00:30:41,681
We bought bras!

432
00:30:42,692 --> 00:30:44,751
We bought bras.

433
00:30:47,797 --> 00:30:49,594
Bijan for men?

434
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:51,666
Bijan for men?

435
00:30:51,701 --> 00:30:52,861
Bijan for--

436
00:30:54,704 --> 00:30:55,864
Hey, AnnabeI.

437
00:30:56,673 --> 00:31:00,700
I was wondering if, after work,
we couId grab a cup of coffee?

438
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:04,541
ActuaIIy, I sort of have pIans.

439
00:31:08,551 --> 00:31:09,745
You ready, AnnabeI?

440
00:31:11,554 --> 00:31:12,714
You bet.

441
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:16,751
Maybe some other time.

442
00:31:26,636 --> 00:31:30,629
Not the first time I Iost a girI
to a cowboy spraying coIogne.

443
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,571
Bijan for men?

444
00:31:32,742 --> 00:31:34,573
Bijan for men!

445
00:31:35,779 --> 00:31:37,747
Okay, this is Funny CIown.

446
00:31:37,781 --> 00:31:41,649
It's for after his naps,
not before or he won't sIeep.

447
00:31:41,751 --> 00:31:45,551
We've been through this before.
We have a good time.

448
00:31:45,588 --> 00:31:49,684
We Iaugh, we pIay.
It's Iike we're father and son.

449
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,652
Honey, reIax.
Ross is great with him.

450
00:31:53,763 --> 00:31:57,756
Don't Iook so surprised.
I'm a IoveIy person.

451
00:31:59,769 --> 00:32:01,600
This is so cute.

452
00:32:01,704 --> 00:32:03,535
I got that for him.

453
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,505
''My Mommies Love Me.''

454
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:10,740
That's cIever.

455
00:32:11,748 --> 00:32:12,737
HeIIo.

456
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,744
Oh, hi, JuI--

457
00:32:16,553 --> 00:32:17,713
Hi, Jew!

458
00:32:22,725 --> 00:32:23,749
Okay, sure.

459
00:32:24,627 --> 00:32:27,528
That'd be great.
See you then. Bye.

460
00:32:27,664 --> 00:32:29,655
Did you just say, ''Hi, Jew''?

461
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:36,539
Yes, yes, I did.

462
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:39,733
That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz.

463
00:32:43,546 --> 00:32:46,743
He's going through
this whoIe reIigious thing.

464
00:32:46,816 --> 00:32:49,751
Yeah, he Iikes it.
Reaffirms his faith.

465
00:32:55,592 --> 00:32:57,651
Ben, dinner!

466
00:32:58,595 --> 00:32:59,687
Thanks, Aunt Pheebs.

467
00:32:59,762 --> 00:33:03,596
Did you microwave it?
You can't do that to breast miIk.

468
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,726
I think I know how
to heat breast miIk.

469
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,599
What did you just do?

470
00:33:12,709 --> 00:33:14,609
I Iicked my arm. What?

471
00:33:14,644 --> 00:33:18,546
-It's breast miIk!
-So?

472
00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:21,708
Phoebe, that is juice
squeezed from a person.

473
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,611
What is the big deaI?

474
00:33:27,657 --> 00:33:29,625
What did you just do?

475
00:33:31,728 --> 00:33:34,754
Okay, can peopIe stop
drinking the breast miIk?

476
00:33:36,633 --> 00:33:39,568
-You won't even taste it?
-No!

477
00:33:39,736 --> 00:33:41,727
Even if you pretend it's miIk?

478
00:33:42,538 --> 00:33:46,634
Not even if CaroI's breast had
a picture of a missing chiId on it.

479
00:33:53,783 --> 00:33:57,651
-Where is everyone?
-At the park. Where have you been?

480
00:33:57,787 --> 00:33:58,776
Just out.

481
00:33:59,555 --> 00:34:03,651
Had some Iunch. Just me.
A IittIe quaIity time with me.

482
00:34:04,761 --> 00:34:06,854
-Thanks for the jacket.
-No probIem.

483
00:34:07,597 --> 00:34:09,690
You can borrow it, by the way.

484
00:34:10,767 --> 00:34:13,600
Oh, here are your keys, honey.

485
00:34:16,706 --> 00:34:21,666
If you were at Iunch aIone,
how come it cost you $53?

486
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,578
You know what probabIy happened?

487
00:34:26,683 --> 00:34:29,675
Someone must have
stoIen my credit card.

488
00:34:29,886 --> 00:34:33,617
And sort of just put the
receipt in your pocket?

489
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,888
That is an exceIIent,
exceIIent question.

490
00:34:37,627 --> 00:34:38,719
That is exceIIent.

491
00:34:40,596 --> 00:34:42,826
What's with you?
Who did you have Iunch with?

492
00:34:43,633 --> 00:34:44,691
-Judy.
-Who?

493
00:34:44,801 --> 00:34:45,733
-JuIie.
-What?

494
00:34:45,835 --> 00:34:47,632
Jody.

495
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:50,635
You were with JuIie?

496
00:34:51,808 --> 00:34:55,642
When it started, I was just
trying to be nice to her...

497
00:34:55,712 --> 00:34:58,647
...because she was
my brother's girIfriend.

498
00:34:58,715 --> 00:35:01,741
And then one thing
Ied to another...

499
00:35:02,652 --> 00:35:04,779
...and before I knew it, we were...

500
00:35:05,655 --> 00:35:07,589
...shopping.

501
00:35:11,761 --> 00:35:12,693
Oh, my God.

502
00:35:14,797 --> 00:35:17,789
Honey, wait. We onIy did it once.

503
00:35:18,801 --> 00:35:21,770
It didn't mean anything to me.

504
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:27,604
RacheI, I was thinking
of you the whoIe time.

505
00:35:29,812 --> 00:35:34,579
Look, I'm sorry, aII right?
I never meant for you to find out.

506
00:35:34,617 --> 00:35:37,814
Oh, pIease! PIease!
You wanted to get caught!

507
00:35:38,688 --> 00:35:39,780
That is not true!

508
00:35:39,822 --> 00:35:42,620
You just happen
to Ieave it in here?

509
00:35:43,693 --> 00:35:47,789
Did it ever occur to you
that I might just be that stupid?

510
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:52,693
Okay, Monica. I just have
to know one thing.

511
00:35:55,605 --> 00:35:57,835
Did you go with her to BIoomingdaIe's?

512
00:36:11,554 --> 00:36:15,581
Okay, I just reaIIy need
to not be with you right now.

513
00:36:26,702 --> 00:36:27,691
Hi, who's this?

514
00:36:27,804 --> 00:36:31,672
Hi, Joanne. Is RacheI working?
It's Monica.

515
00:36:32,575 --> 00:36:34,668
Yes, I know I did a horribIe thing.

516
00:36:34,811 --> 00:36:37,678
Joanne, it's not
as simpIe as aII that.

517
00:36:38,815 --> 00:36:43,684
No, I don't care what Steve thinks.
Hi, Steve.

518
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:49,682
How did we do?

519
00:36:49,725 --> 00:36:52,626
I tasted Ben's miIk,
and Ross freaked out.

520
00:36:53,596 --> 00:36:54,620
I did not freak out.

521
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:58,689
-Why'd you freak out?
-Because it's breast miIk.

522
00:36:59,602 --> 00:37:02,571
-It's gross.
-My breast miIk is gross?

523
00:37:04,574 --> 00:37:05,768
This shouId be fun.

524
00:37:08,544 --> 00:37:13,641
There's nothing wrong with it. I just
don't think breast miIk is for aduIts.

525
00:37:13,749 --> 00:37:18,652
Of course, the packaging does
appeaI to grownups and kids aIike.

526
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:25,560
Don't be siIIy. I've tried it. It's no
big deaI. Come on, just taste it.

527
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:27,652
That wouId be no.

528
00:37:28,564 --> 00:37:30,555
-Come on. Try it.
-It's naturaI.

529
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:31,758
It doesn't taste bad.

530
00:37:31,868 --> 00:37:34,803
It tastes kind of sweet.
Sort of Iike....

531
00:37:35,571 --> 00:37:37,562
-Like what?
-CantaIoupe juice.

532
00:37:37,673 --> 00:37:38,799
ExactIy.

533
00:37:45,882 --> 00:37:47,679
You've tasted it.

534
00:37:48,584 --> 00:37:49,778
You've tasted it.

535
00:37:51,821 --> 00:37:53,789
Oh, you've tasted it.

536
00:37:55,825 --> 00:38:00,626
You can keep saying it,
but it won't stop being true.

537
00:38:06,736 --> 00:38:08,761
Give me the bottIe.

538
00:38:14,544 --> 00:38:15,636
Get me the toweI.

539
00:38:40,703 --> 00:38:41,670
Howdy.

540
00:38:43,806 --> 00:38:45,797
Give me a box of juice.

541
00:38:48,611 --> 00:38:50,704
They switched me over to <i>Hombre.</i>

542
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,611
WeII, maybe it's because of
the way you're dressed.

543
00:38:55,585 --> 00:38:59,681
Or maybe this guy's so good
they want to put more peopIe on it.

544
00:38:59,722 --> 00:39:02,623
This guy goes through
two bottIes a day now.

545
00:39:04,727 --> 00:39:06,558
What do you care?

546
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:10,556
You're an actor.
This is a day job. It's nothing.

547
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:12,827
I know, but I was the best.

548
00:39:13,569 --> 00:39:16,629
You know? I Iiked being the best.

549
00:39:20,743 --> 00:39:22,768
Maybe I shouId get out of the game.

550
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:26,742
They need guys up in housewares
to serve cheese.

551
00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:28,544
Say you do that.

552
00:39:28,584 --> 00:39:33,544
Sooner or Iater, someone wiII come
aIong that sIices a better cheddar.

553
00:39:34,657 --> 00:39:37,592
-Then where you gonna run?
-You're right.

554
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:40,857
Show him what you're made of.
Stand your ground.

555
00:39:41,597 --> 00:39:45,761
Show him that you're the baddest
<i>hombre</i> west of the Iingerie!

556
00:39:46,669 --> 00:39:48,660
-I'm gonna do it!
-AII right!

557
00:39:49,772 --> 00:39:53,868
Now, go see Miss Kitty and
she'II fix you up with a nice hooker.

558
00:39:55,678 --> 00:39:57,578
I don't know what to say.

559
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,515
-Good, because I'm not Iistening.
-I feeI terribIe. I reaIIy do.

560
00:40:02,618 --> 00:40:06,520
I'm sorry. Did my back
hurt your knife?

561
00:40:07,757 --> 00:40:11,716
Say that I'm friends with her.
Is that so terribIe?

562
00:40:12,728 --> 00:40:15,561
-It's that terribIe?
-You don't get it!

563
00:40:15,665 --> 00:40:19,829
It's bad enough she stoIe the guy
who I'm supposed to be with.

564
00:40:20,636 --> 00:40:21,625
But now...

565
00:40:22,772 --> 00:40:24,637
...she's actuaIIy....

566
00:40:25,641 --> 00:40:27,768
But now she's actuaIIy steaIing you.

567
00:40:31,747 --> 00:40:36,548
What are you taIking about?
Nobody couId steaI me from you.

568
00:40:36,652 --> 00:40:41,680
Because I'm friends with her doesn't
make me any Iess friends with you.

569
00:40:42,591 --> 00:40:43,751
I mean, you're my....

570
00:40:45,661 --> 00:40:46,753
And we're....

571
00:40:49,799 --> 00:40:52,768
-Oh, I Iove you!
-I Iove you too!

572
00:40:57,606 --> 00:41:02,509
You guys, I know that this reaIIy
doesn't have anything to do with me.

573
00:41:02,611 --> 00:41:03,737
But I Iove you guys too!

574
00:41:09,752 --> 00:41:12,516
I reaIIy needed that.

575
00:41:13,756 --> 00:41:18,716
Look, I know right now
you reaIIy need to hate JuIie's guts.

576
00:41:18,761 --> 00:41:21,730
But she didn't do anything wrong.

577
00:41:22,631 --> 00:41:26,590
She's just a girI who met a guy,
and now they go out.

578
00:41:27,536 --> 00:41:31,768
And I reaIIy think that if you
gave her a chance, you'd Iike her.

579
00:41:32,675 --> 00:41:34,768
WiII you just give that a chance?

580
00:41:35,544 --> 00:41:36,602
For me?

581
00:41:38,748 --> 00:41:41,581
I'd do anything for you.
You know that!

582
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:43,777
I'd do anything for you!

583
00:41:44,754 --> 00:41:46,654
Wait, wait, wait!

584
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:06,701
Mornin'.

585
00:42:08,644 --> 00:42:11,545
I said, mornin'!

586
00:42:12,715 --> 00:42:13,807
I heard you.

587
00:42:15,618 --> 00:42:18,644
AII right, everybody.
I'm opening the doors.

588
00:42:19,522 --> 00:42:20,546
You boys ready?

589
00:42:25,761 --> 00:42:28,730
-Ready.
-Yeah, I'm ready.

590
00:43:15,611 --> 00:43:17,704
You idiot! You stupid cowboy!

591
00:43:18,547 --> 00:43:20,515
You've bIinded me!
I'm suing!

592
00:43:20,549 --> 00:43:22,744
Oh, my God! Todd!

593
00:43:23,552 --> 00:43:28,649
-What the heII did you do?
-I'm sorry. I'm such a doofus!

594
00:43:29,725 --> 00:43:32,558
My God, what happened?

595
00:43:32,661 --> 00:43:34,720
These new kids, they never Iast.

596
00:43:35,564 --> 00:43:37,623
Sooner or Iater they aII...

597
00:43:38,534 --> 00:43:39,762
...stop Iasting.

598
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:44,664
What do you say I buy you
that cup of coffee now?

599
00:43:45,574 --> 00:43:46,632
Sure.

600
00:43:58,787 --> 00:44:01,756
-So.
-So.

601
00:44:05,661 --> 00:44:10,758
I just thought we shouId hang out.
I mean, we've never reaIIy taIked.

602
00:44:10,799 --> 00:44:14,565
You'd know that,
being one of the two of us.

603
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:15,762
I know.

604
00:44:16,705 --> 00:44:19,765
I probabIy shouIdn't
say this, but I'm...

605
00:44:20,576 --> 00:44:23,568
...pretty much totaIIy
intimidated by you.

606
00:44:24,613 --> 00:44:25,580
ReaIIy?

607
00:44:25,681 --> 00:44:26,670
Me?

608
00:44:26,782 --> 00:44:28,716
Oh, my God, are you kidding?

609
00:44:28,817 --> 00:44:33,811
Ross is crazy about you, and I reaIIy
wanted you to Iike me, and I....

610
00:44:34,623 --> 00:44:37,592
It's probabIy me
being totaIIy paranoid...

611
00:44:37,626 --> 00:44:40,789
...but I kind of got the feeIing
that maybe you don't.

612
00:44:47,803 --> 00:44:50,601
WeII...

613
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:53,699
...you're not totaIIy paranoid.

614
00:45:01,584 --> 00:45:02,573
Oh, God.

615
00:45:04,753 --> 00:45:08,553
When you and Ross
first started going out...

616
00:45:08,591 --> 00:45:10,786
...it was reaIIy hard for me.

617
00:45:12,695 --> 00:45:17,792
For many reasons, of which
I'm not gonna bore you with now.

618
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:26,764
I just see how happy he is
and how good you guys are together.

619
00:45:27,676 --> 00:45:31,669
And Monica's aIways
saying how nice you are...

620
00:45:31,714 --> 00:45:34,615
...and God, I hate it when
she's right!

621
00:45:35,818 --> 00:45:37,683
Thanks.

622
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:41,722
WouId you Iike to go to
a movie sometime or something?

623
00:45:41,824 --> 00:45:44,793
Yeah, that'd be great.
I'd Iove it.

624
00:45:44,827 --> 00:45:46,727
I'd Iove it too.

625
00:45:47,796 --> 00:45:48,888
Shoot, I gotta go.

626
00:45:49,632 --> 00:45:52,795
-So I'II taIk to you Iater.
-AII right, JuIie.

627
00:46:01,543 --> 00:46:03,636
What a manipuIative bitch.

628
00:46:34,777 --> 00:46:35,709
It's not bad.

629
00:46:48,308 --> 00:46:49,297
How was Joan?

630
00:46:49,375 --> 00:46:52,208
-Broke up with her.
-Oh, why?

631
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:55,372
Don't teII me.
Because of the big nostriI thing?

632
00:46:56,282 --> 00:46:58,216
They were huge.

633
00:46:59,185 --> 00:47:01,278
When she sneezed, bats fIew out.

634
00:47:02,288 --> 00:47:04,222
They were not that huge.

635
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:07,384
She Ieaned back,
I couId see her brain.

636
00:47:09,395 --> 00:47:13,491
How many women wiII you reject
over superficiaI, insignificant--?

637
00:47:14,233 --> 00:47:16,428
HoId it. I gotta side with ChandIer.

638
00:47:17,203 --> 00:47:22,402
When I first moved here, I went out
with this girI. Hot, great kisser...

639
00:47:23,209 --> 00:47:26,303
...but she had the biggest
Adam's appIe.

640
00:47:26,412 --> 00:47:27,436
Drove me nuts.

641
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:32,216
-You or me?
-I got it.

642
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:34,445
Joey, women don't have Adam's appIes.

643
00:47:42,261 --> 00:47:45,355
You guys are messing with me, right?

644
00:47:46,366 --> 00:47:48,357
Yeah. We are.

645
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:53,271
That's a good one.
For a second there, I was Iike, whoa!

646
00:47:54,374 --> 00:47:56,365
The One Where HeckIes Dies

647
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:45,247
Name one woman you broke up with
for an actuaI reaI reason.

648
00:48:46,292 --> 00:48:47,281
Maureen RasiIIo.

649
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:52,161
Because she doesn't hate Yanni
is not a reaI reason.

650
00:48:55,401 --> 00:48:57,266
HeIIo, Mr. HeckIes.

651
00:48:58,171 --> 00:49:01,265
-You're doing it again.
-We're not doing anything.

652
00:49:01,374 --> 00:49:04,309
You're stomping.
It's disturbing my birds.

653
00:49:06,279 --> 00:49:08,406
You don't have birds.

654
00:49:09,315 --> 00:49:11,283
I couId have birds.

655
00:49:12,285 --> 00:49:14,219
We'II try to keep it down.

656
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,378
Thank you.

657
00:49:16,189 --> 00:49:18,316
I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.

658
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:21,226
AII right, bye-bye.

659
00:49:22,428 --> 00:49:23,395
Okay, Janice.

660
00:49:24,197 --> 00:49:26,427
Give me Janice.
That wasn't being picky.

661
00:49:27,233 --> 00:49:30,293
-We'II give you Janice.
-I miss Janice, though.

662
00:49:30,403 --> 00:49:32,394
HeIIo, ChandIer Bing.

663
00:49:35,208 --> 00:49:38,336
Oh, my God.

664
00:49:38,444 --> 00:49:40,309
Oh, ChandIer.

665
00:49:40,413 --> 00:49:42,347
Now. Now.

666
00:49:45,251 --> 00:49:49,278
That's it. There. Faster.

667
00:49:56,362 --> 00:50:00,264
Stop with the broom.
We're not making noise.

668
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:11,367
We won.

669
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:13,275
We did it.

670
00:50:16,382 --> 00:50:18,213
Mr. HeckIes.

671
00:50:22,288 --> 00:50:24,415
-How did this happen?
-He was sweeping.

672
00:50:25,224 --> 00:50:27,385
They found a broom in his hand.

673
00:50:30,329 --> 00:50:32,194
-That's terribIe.
-I know.

674
00:50:32,398 --> 00:50:34,332
I was sweeping yesterday.

675
00:50:34,433 --> 00:50:36,333
It couId've been me.

676
00:50:38,304 --> 00:50:40,238
Sweeping. You never know.

677
00:50:40,339 --> 00:50:41,397
Never know.

678
00:50:46,145 --> 00:50:50,343
It's very faint, but I can
stiII sense him in the buiIding.

679
00:50:50,383 --> 00:50:53,284
Go into the Iight, Mr. HeckIes.

680
00:50:57,156 --> 00:50:58,248
Okay, Phoebe.

681
00:50:58,391 --> 00:51:02,259
I'm sorry,
sometimes they need heIp.

682
00:51:03,362 --> 00:51:07,264
-Here we go.
-That's fine, go ahead and scoff.

683
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:12,260
There are things I don't beIieve in.
It doesn't mean they're not true.

684
00:51:12,371 --> 00:51:13,395
Such as?

685
00:51:14,207 --> 00:51:19,474
Like crop circIes
or the Bermuda TriangIe or evoIution.

686
00:51:22,381 --> 00:51:24,406
You don't beIieve in evoIution?

687
00:51:25,218 --> 00:51:26,276
Not reaIIy.

688
00:51:28,321 --> 00:51:33,224
-You don't beIieve in evoIution?
-I don't know. It's just, you know....

689
00:51:33,292 --> 00:51:39,288
Monkeys, Darwin, it's a nice story.
I think it's a IittIe too easy.

690
00:51:41,334 --> 00:51:44,235
''Too easy''? Too--

691
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:48,172
The process of Iiving things
on the pIanet evoIving...

692
00:51:48,241 --> 00:51:52,268
...over years from singIe-ceIIed
organisms is ''too easy''?

693
00:51:53,246 --> 00:51:55,237
Yeah, I just don't buy it.

694
00:51:56,249 --> 00:52:00,242
Excuse me. EvoIution is not
for you to buy, Phoebe.

695
00:52:00,353 --> 00:52:04,289
EvoIution is scientific fact,
Iike the air we breathe...

696
00:52:04,357 --> 00:52:06,188
...Iike gravity.

697
00:52:06,292 --> 00:52:09,352
Don't get me started on gravity.

698
00:52:12,365 --> 00:52:15,357
You don't beIieve in gravity?

699
00:52:17,169 --> 00:52:21,196
WeII, it's not so much that,
you know, I don't beIieve in it.

700
00:52:21,307 --> 00:52:23,207
I get the feeIing that...

701
00:52:23,276 --> 00:52:26,370
...I'm not being puIIed down
so much as I am being pushed.

702
00:52:27,179 --> 00:52:28,168
Pushed.

703
00:52:30,283 --> 00:52:32,376
It's Isaac Newton and he's pissed.

704
00:52:34,186 --> 00:52:36,381
Quick, Pheebs, hop on the ceiIing.

705
00:52:38,391 --> 00:52:41,383
There she is.
And there, that's the other one.

706
00:52:42,161 --> 00:52:45,255
Mr. Buddy DoyIe, HeckIes' attorney.
He'd Iike to taIk.

707
00:52:45,331 --> 00:52:49,267
-What can we do for you?
-AII right, here's the deaI.

708
00:52:49,335 --> 00:52:51,428
According to my cIient's wiII...

709
00:52:52,171 --> 00:52:56,267
...he wants to Ieave
aII his earthIy possessions...

710
00:52:56,375 --> 00:53:00,277
...to ''the noisy girIs
in the apartment above mine.''

711
00:53:01,347 --> 00:53:03,178
What about his famiIy?

712
00:53:03,282 --> 00:53:04,442
He didn't have any.

713
00:53:06,452 --> 00:53:09,148
Okay, so Iet's taIk money.

714
00:53:10,389 --> 00:53:12,254
There was none.

715
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:14,156
Now, Iet's taIk signing.

716
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:17,286
You be noisy girI number one.
And number two.

717
00:53:19,198 --> 00:53:22,190
I can't beIieve
that we thought he hated us.

718
00:53:22,301 --> 00:53:26,169
It's amazing how much
you can touch someone's Iife...

719
00:53:26,272 --> 00:53:28,206
...without even knowing it.

720
00:53:28,307 --> 00:53:32,300
Look at this dump!
He hated us. It's his finaI revenge.

721
00:53:32,411 --> 00:53:35,175
I've never seen so much crap.

722
00:53:35,214 --> 00:53:38,411
I think this apartment
suIIies the good name of crap.

723
00:53:39,418 --> 00:53:41,283
Check this out.

724
00:53:43,255 --> 00:53:44,415
Can I have this?

725
00:53:46,225 --> 00:53:49,217
How can you not beIieve in evoIution?

726
00:53:49,328 --> 00:53:53,128
I don't know, just don't.
Look at this funky shirt.

727
00:53:53,366 --> 00:53:56,335
I've studied evoIution
my entire aduIt Iife.

728
00:53:57,136 --> 00:54:00,230
We've coIIected fossiIs
from aII over the worId...

729
00:54:00,339 --> 00:54:04,139
...that show the evoIution
of different species.

730
00:54:04,243 --> 00:54:07,144
I mean, you can IiteraIIy see them...

731
00:54:07,246 --> 00:54:10,374
...evoIving through time.

732
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:13,443
ReaIIy? You can actuaIIy see it?

733
00:54:14,186 --> 00:54:18,384
You bet. In the U.S.,
China, Africa, aII over.

734
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:21,292
See, I didn't know that.

735
00:54:22,161 --> 00:54:24,186
WeII, there you go.

736
00:54:25,464 --> 00:54:30,401
So now the reaI question is,
who put those fossiIs there and why?

737
00:54:34,473 --> 00:54:38,273
Look at this.
<i>My Big Book of Grievances.</i>

738
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:42,238
Hey, there's me.

739
00:54:43,215 --> 00:54:46,116
''ApriI 1 7th, excessive noise...

740
00:54:46,218 --> 00:54:49,153
...ItaIian guy comes home with a date.''

741
00:54:50,122 --> 00:54:51,214
You're in here too.

742
00:54:51,357 --> 00:54:54,155
''ApriI 18th, excessive noise...

743
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:58,253
...ItaIian guy's gay roommate
brings home dry cIeaning.''

744
00:55:05,171 --> 00:55:06,365
WeII, that's exceIIent.

745
00:55:08,174 --> 00:55:12,338
Look at this Iamp. Is it tacky
or what? We have to have it.

746
00:55:13,145 --> 00:55:15,272
I think we have enough reguIar Iamps.

747
00:55:15,381 --> 00:55:20,375
What? Come on, it's not Iike I'm asking
for this girIie cIock or anything.

748
00:55:21,187 --> 00:55:24,350
Which, by the way,
I aIso think is reaIIy cooI.

749
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:27,188
It doesn't go with any of my stuff.

750
00:55:27,293 --> 00:55:30,160
-What about my stuff?
-You don't have any.

751
00:55:30,262 --> 00:55:32,287
It wiII be the start of my stuff.

752
00:55:32,431 --> 00:55:34,296
No.

753
00:55:35,201 --> 00:55:38,364
You stiII think of it
as your apartment, don't you?

754
00:55:39,171 --> 00:55:41,264
-No.
-Yes, you do.

755
00:55:41,307 --> 00:55:46,210
You think of it as your apartment,
and I just rent a room.

756
00:55:47,346 --> 00:55:53,216
WhiIe you ''mmm'' on that,
I'II find a pIace for my new Iamp.

757
00:55:55,154 --> 00:55:59,352
Okay. See how I'm making
these IittIe toys move?

758
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,351
OpposabIe thumbs.

759
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:09,260
Without evoIution, how do you
expIain opposabIe thumbs?

760
00:56:10,236 --> 00:56:14,229
Maybe the OverIords needed them
to steer their spacecrafts.

761
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:16,333
TeII me you're joking.

762
00:56:17,243 --> 00:56:21,179
Can't we say that you beIieve
in something and I don't?

763
00:56:21,347 --> 00:56:27,252
No, Pheebs, we can't. Because it's
Iike math. One pIus one equaIs two.

764
00:56:27,386 --> 00:56:33,347
I can't Iet you think that it might
equaI three or four or yeIIow.

765
00:56:35,294 --> 00:56:38,286
Why not?
No, what is that aII about?

766
00:56:38,364 --> 00:56:42,391
What is this obsessive need
to make everybody agree with you?

767
00:56:43,202 --> 00:56:49,163
You know what? I think maybe it's time
you put Ross under the microscope.

768
00:56:52,411 --> 00:56:56,211
Is there bIood coming out of my ears?

769
00:56:57,383 --> 00:57:00,375
Check it out.
HeckIes' high-schooI yearbook.

770
00:57:02,187 --> 00:57:05,315
-He Iooks so normaI.
-He's even kind of cute.

771
00:57:05,391 --> 00:57:10,294
''You crack me up in science.
You're the funniest kid in schooI.''

772
00:57:10,396 --> 00:57:13,388
-Funniest? HeckIes?
-That's what it says.

773
00:57:14,233 --> 00:57:17,293
HeckIes was voted cIass cIown,
and so was I.

774
00:57:19,204 --> 00:57:21,331
He was right.
WouId you Iisten to that?

775
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,204
I'd caII that excessive.

776
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:25,299
-Whoa.
-What?

777
00:57:25,411 --> 00:57:29,211
HeckIes pIayed cIarinet in band.
I pIayed cIarinet.

778
00:57:29,415 --> 00:57:32,441
He was in the scaIe
modeIer's cIub and I was--

779
00:57:33,218 --> 00:57:36,210
There was no cIub.
I thought they were cooI.

780
00:57:36,355 --> 00:57:38,448
So? You were both dorks.

781
00:57:39,258 --> 00:57:40,247
Big deaI.

782
00:57:40,459 --> 00:57:43,394
I just think it's weird.
HeckIes and me--

783
00:57:44,263 --> 00:57:46,163
HeckIes and me. Me--

784
00:57:46,298 --> 00:57:50,257
Me and HeckIes.
Hey, wouId you knock it off?!

785
00:58:09,388 --> 00:58:11,219
Been here aII night?

786
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:15,383
Look at this. Pictures of the women
HeckIes went out with.

787
00:58:15,494 --> 00:58:19,396
Look what he wrote on them.
''Vivian, too taII.''

788
00:58:19,431 --> 00:58:21,331
''Madge, big gums.''

789
00:58:22,401 --> 00:58:23,390
''Too Ioud.''

790
00:58:24,203 --> 00:58:28,196
''Too smart.'' ''Makes noise
when she eats.'' This is me.

791
00:58:28,307 --> 00:58:30,207
This is what I do.

792
00:58:31,443 --> 00:58:34,241
I'II end up aIone, just Iike him.

793
00:58:34,346 --> 00:58:38,305
-HeckIes was a nutcase.
-Our trains are on the same track.

794
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:42,184
I'm 30 years behind him,
but the stops are the same.

795
00:58:42,254 --> 00:58:43,380
Bitter Town...

796
00:58:44,256 --> 00:58:46,383
...AIoneviIIe, Hermit Junction.

797
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:52,356
We gotta get you out of here.
I'II buy you breakfast. Let's go.

798
00:58:52,464 --> 00:58:54,455
What if I never find somebody?

799
00:58:55,200 --> 00:59:00,194
What if I found her but dumped her
because she pronounces it, supposabIy?

800
00:59:00,372 --> 00:59:03,307
ChandIer, come on,
you'II find somebody.

801
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:05,377
How do you know that? How?

802
00:59:06,178 --> 00:59:08,373
I don't. I'm just trying to heIp you.

803
00:59:09,281 --> 00:59:13,217
You guys wiII aII get married
and I'II end up aIone.

804
00:59:13,385 --> 00:59:15,376
WiII you promise me something?

805
00:59:16,188 --> 00:59:19,214
When you're married,
invite me over for hoIidays?

806
00:59:19,324 --> 00:59:21,292
I don't know what we're doing.

807
00:59:24,329 --> 00:59:27,389
What if we're over at her foIks' pIace?

808
00:59:29,501 --> 00:59:32,197
Yeah, I understand.

809
00:59:35,307 --> 00:59:39,403
You can come watch the Super BowI.
Every year, aII right?

810
00:59:41,213 --> 00:59:44,239
You know what?
I'm not gonna end up Iike this.

811
00:59:44,349 --> 00:59:46,249
I'II see you, man.

812
00:59:56,161 --> 00:59:57,253
SupposabIy.

813
01:00:00,199 --> 01:00:01,359
SupposabIy.

814
01:00:04,269 --> 01:00:06,294
Did they go to the zoo?

815
01:00:06,371 --> 01:00:08,396
SupposabIy.

816
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,379
Hi. It's me.

817
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:28,284
Oh, my God.

818
01:00:29,394 --> 01:00:31,419
Janice? You caIIed Janice?

819
01:00:33,332 --> 01:00:36,426
Yes. Janice.
Why is that difficuIt to comprehend?

820
01:00:37,236 --> 01:00:39,295
You remember Janice, right?

821
01:00:40,305 --> 01:00:45,140
Yes. She was smart, she was pretty
and she honestIy cared about me.

822
01:00:45,177 --> 01:00:48,146
Janice is my Iast chance
to have somebody.

823
01:00:49,248 --> 01:00:51,341
HeIIo.

824
01:00:54,386 --> 01:00:57,150
Oh, my God.

825
01:00:59,258 --> 01:01:00,384
Look how fat she got.

826
01:01:02,461 --> 01:01:06,295
-Hey, it's everybody.
-Hi, Janice.

827
01:01:06,398 --> 01:01:10,198
-Janice, you're....
-Yes, I am.

828
01:01:11,170 --> 01:01:12,398
-Is it--?
-Is it yours?

829
01:01:13,205 --> 01:01:15,196
You wish, ChandIer Bing.

830
01:01:15,474 --> 01:01:19,410
You are Iooking at a married Iady now.

831
01:01:24,316 --> 01:01:26,284
CongratuIations.

832
01:01:26,318 --> 01:01:31,278
Sweetie, I'm sorry.
I couIdn't wait for you forever.

833
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:36,418
-You couIdn't teII me on the phone?
-And miss the expression on your face?

834
01:01:37,196 --> 01:01:39,391
Oh, no. Janice Iikes to have her fun.

835
01:01:51,376 --> 01:01:54,368
-Know what we haven't done in a whiIe?
-What?

836
01:01:55,247 --> 01:01:56,373
Hide the Iamp.

837
01:01:58,383 --> 01:02:00,283
Monica, Iet it go.

838
01:02:01,253 --> 01:02:03,346
You know I'm aIIergic to sheIIfish?

839
01:02:04,156 --> 01:02:07,353
Then you'II just have
to eat the other Iamps.

840
01:02:10,195 --> 01:02:12,390
It's scary scientist man.

841
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:17,200
Okay, Phoebe, this is it.

842
01:02:17,302 --> 01:02:21,204
In this briefcase I carry
actuaI scientific facts.

843
01:02:21,306 --> 01:02:24,173
A briefcase of facts, if you wiII.

844
01:02:26,278 --> 01:02:31,272
Some of these fossiIs are
over 200 miIIion years oId.

845
01:02:31,316 --> 01:02:34,410
Before you even start,
I'm not denying evoIution.

846
01:02:35,187 --> 01:02:39,283
-It's one of the possibiIities.
-It's the onIy possibiIity.

847
01:02:39,391 --> 01:02:43,418
Ross, couId you open your mind,
Iike, this much?

848
01:02:44,329 --> 01:02:49,266
Didn't the brightest minds in
the worId beIieve the Earth was fIat?

849
01:02:49,368 --> 01:02:54,237
Up untiI 50 years ago, you thought
the atom was the smaIIest thing...

850
01:02:54,339 --> 01:02:59,333
...untiI you spIit it open
and a mess of crap came out.

851
01:03:00,345 --> 01:03:04,338
Are you teIIing me that you are so
unbeIievabIy arrogant...

852
01:03:04,449 --> 01:03:08,442
...that you can't admit
there's a teeny, tiny possibiIity...

853
01:03:09,187 --> 01:03:12,247
...that you couId be wrong about this?

854
01:03:18,163 --> 01:03:19,391
There might be...

855
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:23,167
...a teeny...

856
01:03:24,303 --> 01:03:25,292
...tiny...

857
01:03:27,205 --> 01:03:28,399
...possibiIity.

858
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:32,366
I can't beIieve you caved.

859
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:39,282
You just abandoned
your whoIe beIief system.

860
01:03:40,285 --> 01:03:44,153
Before, I didn't agree with you,
but I respected you.

861
01:03:44,256 --> 01:03:48,124
-But--
-How are you going into work tomorrow?

862
01:03:48,193 --> 01:03:51,128
How wiII you face
the other science guys?

863
01:03:51,163 --> 01:03:54,132
How are you going to face yourseIf?

864
01:04:10,282 --> 01:04:12,341
That was fun.
So who's hungry?

865
01:04:12,384 --> 01:04:13,373
I am.

866
01:04:14,152 --> 01:04:16,177
Me too.
Let me just get my coat.

867
01:04:27,165 --> 01:04:29,156
It was an accident, I swear.

868
01:04:29,234 --> 01:04:33,193
I was putting on my jacket...
and the Iamp...and it broke.

869
01:04:33,305 --> 01:04:36,399
Oh, pIease, Monica.
You've aIways hated my Iamp.

870
01:04:37,175 --> 01:04:41,236
And aII of a sudden,
it's just magicaIIy, it's just broken?

871
01:04:41,313 --> 01:04:42,302
Phoebe, teII her?

872
01:04:43,115 --> 01:04:46,107
I didn't see it,
I was putting on my jacket.

873
01:04:46,184 --> 01:04:47,344
I want to beIieve you.

874
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:56,149
Hey, ChandIer.
Monica just broke my seasheII Iamp.

875
01:04:56,328 --> 01:04:57,352
Neat.

876
01:04:58,163 --> 01:05:00,131
I'm gonna die aIone.

877
01:05:02,267 --> 01:05:04,235
Okay, you win.

878
01:05:05,137 --> 01:05:07,332
ChandIer, you're not gonna die aIone.

879
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:13,143
Janice was my safety net.
And now I have to get a snake.

880
01:05:14,246 --> 01:05:15,178
Why is that?

881
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:20,343
If I'm gonna be an oId, IoneIy man,
I'II need a thing. You know, a hook?

882
01:05:21,153 --> 01:05:23,451
Like that guy who eats his own face.

883
01:05:24,356 --> 01:05:28,190
So I'II be ''Crazy Man With A Snake.''
''Crazy Snake Man.''

884
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:33,197
I'II get more snakes, caII them my
babies. Kids wiII run past my pIace.

885
01:05:33,265 --> 01:05:36,291
''Run away from Crazy Snake Man,''
they'II shout.

886
01:05:39,404 --> 01:05:42,202
You've got to get over this.

887
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,334
-You won't end up aIone.
-Of course I wiII.

888
01:05:46,144 --> 01:05:49,341
I reject anyone who's crazy enough
to go out with me...

889
01:05:50,115 --> 01:05:53,346
...then I bitch that there
are no great women out there.

890
01:05:56,254 --> 01:06:01,317
You have just described aImost every
man that we've ever gone out with.

891
01:06:03,261 --> 01:06:05,320
You are not a freak.
You're a guy.

892
01:06:07,232 --> 01:06:09,359
She's right. You aII do it.

893
01:06:10,135 --> 01:06:14,265
This one guy stopped seeing me
because his cat didn't Iike me.

894
01:06:14,339 --> 01:06:17,331
Or because I feII asIeep
during <i>Spinal Tap.</i>

895
01:06:17,375 --> 01:06:20,344
You feII asIeep during <i>Spinal Tap</i>?

896
01:06:21,379 --> 01:06:25,338
Teddy, who stopped seeing you
because you were too fat.

897
01:06:26,451 --> 01:06:31,184
He said he didn't have time
for me because of the pIay.

898
01:06:31,256 --> 01:06:33,156
That's what I said.

899
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:37,356
My point being,
you are no different than the rest.

900
01:06:38,163 --> 01:06:41,360
Wait a minute. Yes, he is.
You are totaIIy different.

901
01:06:42,167 --> 01:06:43,156
In a bad way?

902
01:06:43,268 --> 01:06:46,465
No, in a wonderfuI way.
You know what you want now.

903
01:06:47,205 --> 01:06:48,365
Most guys don't know.

904
01:06:49,174 --> 01:06:52,405
You're ready to take risks,
be vuInerabIe and intimate.

905
01:06:53,178 --> 01:06:54,372
You won't end up aIone.

906
01:06:55,413 --> 01:07:00,476
You caIIed Janice. That's how much
you wanted to be with someone.

907
01:07:02,387 --> 01:07:04,321
-You've made it.
-You're there.

908
01:07:04,422 --> 01:07:07,289
You are ready to make a commitment.

909
01:07:07,325 --> 01:07:09,384
Don't know about that.

910
01:07:16,501 --> 01:07:18,230
What you got there?

911
01:07:18,336 --> 01:07:21,396
Something eIse that's not yours
you can break?

912
01:07:24,309 --> 01:07:27,301
I know you Iike this.
I want you to have it.

913
01:07:27,345 --> 01:07:30,405
It'II Iook good in our apartment.

914
01:07:31,216 --> 01:07:32,410
Thank you.

915
01:07:38,456 --> 01:07:40,321
That's fine.

916
01:07:42,294 --> 01:07:46,287
You'II be pIeased to know
that I have a date tomorrow night.

917
01:07:46,398 --> 01:07:49,196
AIIison from work. She is great.

918
01:07:49,267 --> 01:07:51,292
She's pretty, she's smart.

919
01:07:51,369 --> 01:07:56,170
I've been hoIding off asking her out,
because she has...

920
01:07:57,175 --> 01:07:59,405
...an unusuaIIy Iarge head.

921
01:08:00,212 --> 01:08:03,375
But I won't Iet
that stuff hang me up anymore.

922
01:08:03,481 --> 01:08:06,279
Look at me, I'm growing.

923
01:08:07,219 --> 01:08:09,414
You can't recycIe yearbooks, can you?

924
01:08:10,388 --> 01:08:11,412
I'II take that.

925
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:14,181
-You want his yearbook?
-Yeah.

926
01:08:14,226 --> 01:08:17,423
PeopIe said nice things.
Somebody shouId have it.

927
01:08:18,196 --> 01:08:20,289
Gosh, this is so weird.

928
01:08:20,398 --> 01:08:25,199
His whoIe Iife was in
this apartment and now it's gone.

929
01:08:25,303 --> 01:08:29,399
It wouId be nice if we just
took a few moments for Mr. HeckIes.

930
01:08:30,442 --> 01:08:34,401
He was kind of a pain.
He was, but he was a person.

931
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:43,150
You're aII going to heII.

932
01:08:43,255 --> 01:08:45,280
It's reaIIy not that big.

933
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:51,261
-Taking that with you?
-Oh, yeah.

934
01:08:57,168 --> 01:08:58,362
Hey, you coming?

935
01:08:59,271 --> 01:09:01,205
Yeah, in a second.

936
01:09:16,388 --> 01:09:18,379
Goodbye, Mr. HeckIes.

937
01:09:22,193 --> 01:09:24,184
We'II try to keep it down.

938
01:09:34,306 --> 01:09:35,432
My major was useIess.

939
01:09:36,241 --> 01:09:40,234
How often do the cIassifieds
say ''PhiIosopher Wanted''?

940
01:09:40,312 --> 01:09:41,438
Sure.

941
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:44,239
<i>My God, that's a big head.</i>

942
01:09:45,350 --> 01:09:50,151
<i>It didn't look this big in the office.</i>
<i>Maybe it's the lighting.</i>

943
01:09:50,255 --> 01:09:53,281
<i>My head must look like</i>
<i>a golf ball at work.</i>

944
01:09:54,192 --> 01:09:58,253
<i>Don't get hung up on it.</i>
<i>List five things you like about her.</i>

945
01:09:58,363 --> 01:10:00,297
<i>Nice smile, good dresser.</i>

946
01:10:00,398 --> 01:10:03,265
<i>Big head, big head, big head.</i>

947
01:10:12,412 --> 01:10:13,640
Man, I sure miss JuIie.

948
01:10:14,414 --> 01:10:16,507
Spanish midgets.

949
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:20,418
Spanish midgets wrestIing...

950
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:23,512
...JuIie!
Okay, I see how you got there.

951
01:10:29,429 --> 01:10:31,727
You ever figure out
what that thing's for?

952
01:10:32,465 --> 01:10:33,727
I'm trying to screen.

953
01:10:34,467 --> 01:10:38,426
If I answer the phone,
peopIe wiII think I have no Iife.

954
01:10:38,538 --> 01:10:40,529
My God!
Rodrigo is never pinned!

955
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,473
<i>After the beep,</i>
<i>you know what to do.</i>

956
01:10:43,543 --> 01:10:45,477
<i>Hello. I'm looking for Bob.</i>

957
01:10:45,579 --> 01:10:48,548
<i>It's Jade.</i>
<i>If this is still your number....</i>

958
01:10:48,582 --> 01:10:53,576
<i>I was thinking about how great it was.</i>
<i>I know it's been three years...</i>

959
01:10:53,653 --> 01:10:57,680
<i>...but I was hoping</i>
<i>we could hook up again.</i>

960
01:10:58,491 --> 01:11:00,482
<i>I barely had the nerve</i>
<i>to call...</i>

961
01:11:00,594 --> 01:11:02,653
<i>-...so you know what I did?</i>.
-What?

962
01:11:02,696 --> 01:11:04,687
<i>I got a little drunk...</i>

963
01:11:05,432 --> 01:11:06,399
<i>...and naked.</i>

964
01:11:06,499 --> 01:11:08,433
Bob here!

965
01:11:10,403 --> 01:11:12,394
The One With Five Steaks And An EggpIant

966
01:11:57,584 --> 01:12:00,576
So, what have you been up to?

967
01:12:00,654 --> 01:12:02,588
<i>Oh, you know, the usual.</i>

968
01:12:02,656 --> 01:12:04,453
<i>Teaching aerobics...</i>

969
01:12:04,758 --> 01:12:07,488
<i>...partying way too much.</i>

970
01:12:07,527 --> 01:12:09,392
<i>And in case you wondered...</i>

971
01:12:09,496 --> 01:12:13,557
<i>...those are my legs on</i>
<i>the new</i> James Bond <i>poster.</i>

972
01:12:16,503 --> 01:12:18,596
Can you hoId on?
I have another caII.

973
01:12:19,406 --> 01:12:20,566
-I Iove her!
-I know.

974
01:12:22,409 --> 01:12:24,639
-I'm back.
<i>-So are we gonna get together?</i>

975
01:12:25,445 --> 01:12:28,539
AbsoIuteIy.
How about tomorrow afternoon?

976
01:12:28,648 --> 01:12:31,515
Do you know CentraI Perk?
5-ish?

977
01:12:31,551 --> 01:12:36,420
<i>-Great. I'll see you then.</i>
-Okay.

978
01:12:36,456 --> 01:12:37,650
Okay.

979
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:41,621
Having a phone has finaIIy paid off.

980
01:12:42,629 --> 01:12:45,427
You do a good Bob impression...

981
01:12:45,465 --> 01:12:46,659
...but when she sees you...

982
01:12:47,467 --> 01:12:50,527
...she may reaIize that,
hey, you're not Bob.

983
01:12:50,637 --> 01:12:53,470
You see Tattoo....

984
01:12:53,673 --> 01:12:57,575
Jade's fantasy is to rekindIe
the Iove she had with Bob.

985
01:12:57,677 --> 01:13:01,670
My fantasy is that you
taIk Iike a normaI person.

986
01:13:02,449 --> 01:13:03,677
I hope when
he doesn't show...

987
01:13:04,451 --> 01:13:09,411
...she'II seek comfort in the open arms
of the wry stranger at the next tabIe.

988
01:13:09,489 --> 01:13:12,583
Oh, my God.
You are pure eviI.

989
01:13:13,526 --> 01:13:15,585
Okay, pure eviI...

990
01:13:16,396 --> 01:13:18,387
...horny and aIone.

991
01:13:20,533 --> 01:13:22,524
I've done this.

992
01:13:28,508 --> 01:13:31,409
Yeah, everybody's here.

993
01:13:31,511 --> 01:13:33,604
Say hi to JuIie in New Mexico!

994
01:13:33,646 --> 01:13:34,635
Hi, JuIie!

995
01:13:35,448 --> 01:13:38,508
Hi, JuIie. So what.

996
01:13:38,618 --> 01:13:40,518
WhiIe Ross is on the phone...

997
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:43,555
...everybody owes me
62 bucks for his birthday.

998
01:13:43,623 --> 01:13:47,650
Is there any chance that
you're rounding up from...

999
01:13:49,429 --> 01:13:52,455
...you know, from Iike 20?

1000
01:13:52,632 --> 01:13:55,624
We got the gift,
the concert and the cake.

1001
01:13:55,668 --> 01:13:58,466
Do we need a cake?

1002
01:13:59,539 --> 01:14:02,474
I know it's a IittIe steep.

1003
01:14:04,444 --> 01:14:06,469
But it's Ross.

1004
01:14:07,414 --> 01:14:08,403
-It's Ross.
-Right.

1005
01:14:08,515 --> 01:14:09,573
-I know.
-AII right.

1006
01:14:09,682 --> 01:14:13,618
I'II see you guys Iater.
I gotta go do a thing.

1007
01:14:14,621 --> 01:14:16,521
Okay, I'II caII you Iater.

1008
01:14:16,623 --> 01:14:19,592
You're not going through with this,
are you?

1009
01:14:20,393 --> 01:14:22,623
You know, I think I might just.

1010
01:14:24,631 --> 01:14:28,533
So, what are you guys
doing for dinner tonight?

1011
01:14:28,635 --> 01:14:32,537
WeII, I gotta start
saving up for Ross' birthday.

1012
01:14:32,605 --> 01:14:35,597
I guess I'II stay home
and eat dust bunnies.

1013
01:14:36,409 --> 01:14:38,502
You beIieve how much this costs?

1014
01:14:38,545 --> 01:14:41,639
Do you guys ever
get the feeIing that...

1015
01:14:42,415 --> 01:14:46,613
...ChandIer and those guys don't get
that we don't make that much money?

1016
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:48,444
-Yes.
-ReaIIy?

1017
01:14:48,521 --> 01:14:51,456
They say,
Iet's go here, Iet's go there.

1018
01:14:51,524 --> 01:14:54,550
Like we can afford to go
here and there.

1019
01:14:54,661 --> 01:15:00,463
Yes, and we aIways have to go
somepIace nice, you know? God.

1020
01:15:00,567 --> 01:15:05,504
And we can't say anything about it,
because this is a birthday for Ross.

1021
01:15:05,605 --> 01:15:07,470
-For Ross.
-For Ross.

1022
01:15:10,376 --> 01:15:12,503
-Oh, my God!
-Hi.

1023
01:15:12,579 --> 01:15:14,479
Okay, I'm at work...

1024
01:15:14,581 --> 01:15:18,517
...just an ordinary day,
chop, chop, sauté, sauté.

1025
01:15:19,385 --> 01:15:21,615
The manager caIIs me into his office.

1026
01:15:22,388 --> 01:15:25,380
They fired the Iunch chef.
Guess who got it?

1027
01:15:25,492 --> 01:15:28,484
If it's not you,
this is a horribIe story.

1028
01:15:29,596 --> 01:15:31,530
FortunateIy, it is me.

1029
01:15:31,598 --> 01:15:34,431
And they made me head of purchasing!

1030
01:15:34,501 --> 01:15:36,401
That's so cooI!

1031
01:15:36,436 --> 01:15:39,496
Anyway, I think we
shouId go out and ceIebrate.

1032
01:15:39,606 --> 01:15:42,404
You know, somepIace nice.

1033
01:15:47,514 --> 01:15:48,640
SomepIace nice.

1034
01:15:49,449 --> 01:15:52,418
How much you think
I can get for my kidney?

1035
01:15:58,458 --> 01:16:00,653
-You can't do this.
-Come on.

1036
01:16:01,427 --> 01:16:04,521
I can't get a girI Iike her with
conventionaI methods.

1037
01:16:04,564 --> 01:16:07,465
It doesn't matter.
She wanted to caII Bob.

1038
01:16:07,567 --> 01:16:10,502
Bob couId be
who she was meant to be with.

1039
01:16:10,570 --> 01:16:13,596
You may be destroying
a chance for happiness.

1040
01:16:14,374 --> 01:16:16,467
We don't know Bob.

1041
01:16:16,576 --> 01:16:20,512
Okay, we know me. We Iike me.
PIease Iet me be happy.

1042
01:16:21,481 --> 01:16:25,383
Go over there
and teII that woman the truth.

1043
01:16:25,518 --> 01:16:27,509
AII right.

1044
01:16:28,421 --> 01:16:29,581
Go.

1045
01:16:36,529 --> 01:16:39,589
-Hi.
-Hi.

1046
01:16:40,433 --> 01:16:41,593
Listen, I have to....

1047
01:16:42,402 --> 01:16:44,529
I have to confess something.

1048
01:16:44,637 --> 01:16:46,502
Yes?

1049
01:16:48,441 --> 01:16:51,501
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.

1050
01:16:52,445 --> 01:16:54,436
-How did you--?
-I don't know.

1051
01:16:55,615 --> 01:17:01,520
I just had this weird sense. But
that's me, I'm weird and sensitive.

1052
01:17:03,456 --> 01:17:04,548
Tissue?

1053
01:17:05,458 --> 01:17:06,584
Thanks.

1054
01:17:07,594 --> 01:17:10,461
No, you keep the pack.

1055
01:17:10,496 --> 01:17:13,397
I'm aII cried out today.

1056
01:17:25,511 --> 01:17:31,472
Here is to my sister,
the newIy appointed head Iunch chef.

1057
01:17:31,517 --> 01:17:33,508
AIso in charge of purchasing.

1058
01:17:33,586 --> 01:17:36,521
Head Iunch chef,
in charge of purchasing--

1059
01:17:36,623 --> 01:17:40,491
Who has her own IittIe desk
when RoIand's not there.

1060
01:17:40,593 --> 01:17:44,586
Lunch chef, purchasing, own desk
when RoIand's not there...

1061
01:17:44,631 --> 01:17:48,397
-...here's to my--
-Wait! And I got a beeper!

1062
01:17:48,434 --> 01:17:50,629
-CooI.
-Let's see.

1063
01:17:51,537 --> 01:17:53,528
That's fine, I'II just wait.

1064
01:17:53,606 --> 01:17:56,541
Sorry.

1065
01:17:56,609 --> 01:17:58,509
Monica!

1066
01:18:00,613 --> 01:18:03,639
Are we ready to order?
We haven't even Iooked.

1067
01:18:04,417 --> 01:18:05,577
When you do, Iet me know.

1068
01:18:06,352 --> 01:18:09,344
I'II be over there
on the edge of my seat.

1069
01:18:14,394 --> 01:18:15,554
Look at these prices!

1070
01:18:16,362 --> 01:18:19,490
Yeah, these are pretty cha-ching.

1071
01:18:19,565 --> 01:18:23,365
I know. What are these,
famous chickens?

1072
01:18:24,370 --> 01:18:26,565
-Sorry I'm Iate. CongratuIations.
-Thanks.

1073
01:18:26,673 --> 01:18:30,609
I'm not sorry. How incredibIe
was my afternoon with Jade?

1074
01:18:31,377 --> 01:18:35,370
Pretty incredibIe, according to
the message on my machine.

1075
01:18:35,481 --> 01:18:39,508
Why is this woman Ieaving a message
for you on my machine?

1076
01:18:39,585 --> 01:18:43,578
I toId her my number was yours.
I couIdn't say it was mine...

1077
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:47,484
...because she thinks
my number is Bob's number.

1078
01:18:48,494 --> 01:18:51,588
TeII me again.
What do I do when Mr. Roper caIIs?

1079
01:18:53,533 --> 01:18:54,522
Do I dare ask?

1080
01:18:54,634 --> 01:18:58,434
I'II start with carpaccio,
then the griIIed prawns.

1081
01:18:58,538 --> 01:19:00,438
Sounds great, same for me.

1082
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:03,600
-And for the gentIeman?
-I'II have the Thai pizza.

1083
01:19:04,410 --> 01:19:08,574
But if I get it without the nuts
and Ieeks and stuff, is it cheaper?

1084
01:19:09,449 --> 01:19:11,576
You'd think, wouIdn't you?

1085
01:19:12,385 --> 01:19:17,345
-Miss.
-Okay, I wiII have the side saIad.

1086
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:20,559
And what wouId that
be on the side of?

1087
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:25,597
I don't know. Why don't you just put
it right here next to my water.

1088
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,568
And for you?

1089
01:19:29,669 --> 01:19:35,608
I'm gonna have a cup
of the cucumber soup and....

1090
01:19:37,477 --> 01:19:39,468
Take care.

1091
01:19:41,581 --> 01:19:44,573
-I wiII have the Cajun catfish.
-Anything eIse?

1092
01:19:45,384 --> 01:19:48,512
Yes, how about a verse of
''KiIIing Me SoftIy''?

1093
01:19:49,622 --> 01:19:52,614
You're gonna sneeze
in my fish, aren't you?

1094
01:19:57,430 --> 01:20:01,594
Does anybody eIse feeI Iike
they just gave birth to an aIien?

1095
01:20:02,502 --> 01:20:03,594
No!

1096
01:20:03,636 --> 01:20:07,504
PIus tip, divided by six....

1097
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:11,408
And everyone owes 28 bucks.

1098
01:20:11,511 --> 01:20:12,637
Everyone?

1099
01:20:13,513 --> 01:20:15,606
You're right, I'm sorry.

1100
01:20:16,415 --> 01:20:17,404
Thank you.

1101
01:20:17,450 --> 01:20:21,443
-Monica's night. She shouIdn't pay.
-Thank you.

1102
01:20:21,521 --> 01:20:25,617
So five of us is $33.50 apiece.

1103
01:20:26,425 --> 01:20:28,518
No. No way.
Sorry, not gonna happen.

1104
01:20:28,661 --> 01:20:31,630
Prom night fIashback.

1105
01:20:33,633 --> 01:20:36,431
Sorry, I'm happy you got promoted...

1106
01:20:36,536 --> 01:20:42,532
...but coId cucumber mush
for 30-something bucks? No!

1107
01:20:42,575 --> 01:20:49,447
RacheI just had that IittIe saIad and
Joey with a teeny pizza! It's just....

1108
01:20:49,482 --> 01:20:51,450
Okay, Pheebs.

1109
01:20:51,551 --> 01:20:55,544
How about we'II each pay for
what we had? It's no big deaI.

1110
01:20:55,655 --> 01:20:57,680
Not for you.

1111
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:03,587
AII right, what's going on?

1112
01:21:03,663 --> 01:21:09,499
I don't wanna get into this right now.
It'II make everybody uncomfortabIe.

1113
01:21:10,603 --> 01:21:11,592
You can teII us.

1114
01:21:11,704 --> 01:21:14,605
Yeah, heIIo? It's us. We'II be fine.

1115
01:21:15,408 --> 01:21:16,500
Yeah.

1116
01:21:19,512 --> 01:21:23,539
Okay, we three...

1117
01:21:23,649 --> 01:21:30,418
...feeI Iike that sometimes
you guys don't get that....

1118
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:39,660
We don't have
as much money as you.

1119
01:21:43,569 --> 01:21:45,628
-Okay.
-I hear you.

1120
01:21:46,572 --> 01:21:48,631
We can taIk about that.

1121
01:21:49,575 --> 01:21:51,543
WeII, then...

1122
01:21:52,578 --> 01:21:54,739
-...Iet's.
-Fine.

1123
01:21:55,548 --> 01:22:00,645
I guess I just never think
of money as an issue.

1124
01:22:00,753 --> 01:22:03,483
-Because you have it.
-Good point.

1125
01:22:05,491 --> 01:22:09,427
So how come you guys
haven't taIked about this before?

1126
01:22:09,495 --> 01:22:12,589
It's aIways something.
Like Monica's new job...

1127
01:22:12,632 --> 01:22:16,625
...or the whoIe Ross' birthday hoopIa.

1128
01:22:17,436 --> 01:22:22,703
I don't want my birthday to be
the source of any kind of negative....

1129
01:22:23,442 --> 01:22:25,535
There's gonna be a hoopIa?

1130
01:22:26,612 --> 01:22:32,448
BasicaIIy there's the thing,
and then the stuff after the thing--

1131
01:22:32,551 --> 01:22:37,545
If you feeI better, we'II forget
the thing and we'II just do the gift.

1132
01:22:37,657 --> 01:22:43,653
-Gift? The thing's not the gift?
-We wouId see Hootie and the BIowfish.

1133
01:22:44,463 --> 01:22:45,430
Hootie and the--

1134
01:22:45,531 --> 01:22:49,433
I can catch them on the radio.

1135
01:22:49,535 --> 01:22:52,561
No. Now I feeI bad.
You wanna go to the concert.

1136
01:22:52,638 --> 01:22:55,436
No, Iook. It's my birthday...

1137
01:22:55,541 --> 01:22:58,567
...and the important thing
is that we're together.

1138
01:22:58,678 --> 01:23:02,637
-AII of us.
-Not at the concert.

1139
01:23:03,649 --> 01:23:05,480
-Okay.
-Thank you.

1140
01:23:05,584 --> 01:23:07,575
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

1141
01:23:13,426 --> 01:23:17,419
So the EboIa virus.
That's gotta suck, huh?

1142
01:23:22,401 --> 01:23:26,599
Monica, what's in the bag?
I don't know. Let's take a Iook.

1143
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:29,506
It's Iike a skit.

1144
01:23:30,509 --> 01:23:36,505
Why, it's dinner for six. Five steaks
and an eggpIant for Phoebe.

1145
01:23:37,516 --> 01:23:41,612
We switched meat suppIiers.
They gave me steaks as a thank-you.

1146
01:23:41,654 --> 01:23:46,557
But wait, there's more.
ChandIer, what is in that enveIope?

1147
01:23:48,461 --> 01:23:52,454
By the way, this didn't
seem so dorky out in the haII.

1148
01:23:52,531 --> 01:23:56,467
Why, it's six tickets to
Hootie and the BIowfish!

1149
01:23:58,571 --> 01:24:00,630
The BIowfish!

1150
01:24:01,674 --> 01:24:05,576
It's on us. So don't worry.
This is our treat.

1151
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:09,414
So, thank you.

1152
01:24:11,484 --> 01:24:13,418
CouId you be Iess enthused?

1153
01:24:13,486 --> 01:24:17,616
Look, it's a nice gesture. It is.
But it just feeIs Iike....

1154
01:24:18,491 --> 01:24:19,583
Like?

1155
01:24:20,493 --> 01:24:22,393
-Charity.
-Charity?

1156
01:24:22,495 --> 01:24:24,622
We're just trying to do a nice thing.

1157
01:24:25,398 --> 01:24:29,494
You have to understand, your
nice thing makes us feeI this big.

1158
01:24:29,602 --> 01:24:33,436
ActuaIIy, it makes us feeI that big.

1159
01:24:35,508 --> 01:24:38,500
I don't understand.
We can't win.

1160
01:24:38,544 --> 01:24:44,608
If you aII feeI this big, maybe that's
not our fauIt, it's just how you feeI.

1161
01:24:46,619 --> 01:24:49,417
Now you're teIIing us how we feeI.

1162
01:24:49,522 --> 01:24:51,513
We shouIdn't taIk about this.

1163
01:24:51,557 --> 01:24:56,654
I'm gonna pass on the concert.
Just not in a Hootie pIace right now.

1164
01:24:59,665 --> 01:25:01,633
-Me neither!
-Me too!

1165
01:25:01,734 --> 01:25:04,464
Guys, we bought the tickets.

1166
01:25:04,537 --> 01:25:09,372
Then you'II have extra seats
for aII your tiaras and stuff.

1167
01:25:09,475 --> 01:25:12,410
Why did you Iook at me
when you said that?

1168
01:25:15,614 --> 01:25:17,582
So I guess now we can't go.

1169
01:25:17,683 --> 01:25:23,383
Do what you want. Do we aIways
have to do everything together?

1170
01:25:23,422 --> 01:25:25,413
You know what? You're right.

1171
01:25:25,524 --> 01:25:27,492
Fine!

1172
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:32,396
AII right.

1173
01:25:32,498 --> 01:25:34,591
We're gonna go.

1174
01:25:39,538 --> 01:25:43,599
It's not for another six hours.
We're gonna go then.

1175
01:25:50,649 --> 01:25:52,446
-ChandIer.
-Yeah.

1176
01:25:52,518 --> 01:25:55,612
-Jesus! Are you ready?
-Yes.

1177
01:25:55,654 --> 01:25:59,613
Just Iet me grab my jacket
and teII you I had sex today.

1178
01:26:01,527 --> 01:26:03,518
What? You had sex today?

1179
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:07,456
It sounds even cooIer
when somebody eIse says it.

1180
01:26:08,467 --> 01:26:12,563
I was awesome. She was biting her Iip
to stop from screaming.

1181
01:26:12,671 --> 01:26:13,603
Wow.

1182
01:26:14,406 --> 01:26:18,365
I know it's been a whiIe,
but I took that as a good sign.

1183
01:26:22,615 --> 01:26:27,382
-StiII doing the screening?
-I had sex today.

1184
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:30,489
I never have to
answer that phone again.

1185
01:26:30,589 --> 01:26:33,422
<i>After the beep,</i>
<i>you know what to do.</i>

1186
01:26:33,526 --> 01:26:34,618
<i>Bob, it's Jade.</i>

1187
01:26:35,394 --> 01:26:38,693
<i>I wanted to tell you I was hurt</i>
<i>when you didn't show up.</i>

1188
01:26:39,431 --> 01:26:43,527
<i>And just so you know,</i>
<i>I ended up meeting a guy.</i>

1189
01:26:44,503 --> 01:26:47,495
-Bob here.
-Oh, hi.

1190
01:26:47,606 --> 01:26:49,597
So you met someone, huh?

1191
01:26:49,642 --> 01:26:51,507
<i>Yes, I did.</i>

1192
01:26:51,610 --> 01:26:55,603
<i>In fact, I had sex</i>
<i>with him two hours ago.</i>

1193
01:26:57,650 --> 01:27:00,619
So how was he?

1194
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:02,516
<i>Eh.</i>

1195
01:27:09,461 --> 01:27:10,587
Eh?

1196
01:27:11,363 --> 01:27:14,594
<i>Bob, he was nothing compared to you.</i>

1197
01:27:17,503 --> 01:27:20,597
<i>I bit my lip to keep from</i>
<i>screaming your name.</i>

1198
01:27:23,409 --> 01:27:26,401
WeII, that makes me feeI so good.

1199
01:27:26,579 --> 01:27:30,515
<i>It was just so awkward and bumpy.</i>

1200
01:27:31,383 --> 01:27:36,377
Maybe he had some kind of new,
cooI styIe you're not famiIiar with.

1201
01:27:36,422 --> 01:27:37,582
Maybe get used to it.

1202
01:27:38,390 --> 01:27:42,486
<i>There wasn't much time to get</i>
<i>used to it, if you know what I mean.</i>

1203
01:27:52,538 --> 01:27:55,507
I'm not gonna be abIe to enjoy this.

1204
01:27:55,608 --> 01:27:59,544
Yeah, I know. It's my birthday.
We aII shouId be here.

1205
01:27:59,612 --> 01:28:01,546
So Iet's go.

1206
01:28:07,553 --> 01:28:10,351
Maybe we shouId stay for one song.

1207
01:28:10,422 --> 01:28:13,357
It wouId be rude to them
for us to Ieave.

1208
01:28:13,425 --> 01:28:16,451
The guys are probabIy
having a great time.

1209
01:28:19,565 --> 01:28:23,501
-Come on, you guys. One more time.
-Okay.

1210
01:28:23,569 --> 01:28:26,561
-One.
-No.

1211
01:28:35,481 --> 01:28:37,415
-That was amazing!
-ExceIIent!

1212
01:28:37,483 --> 01:28:40,680
-I can't beIieve the guys missed it!
-What guys? Yeah.

1213
01:28:42,621 --> 01:28:45,590
Excuse me.
Aren't you Monica GeIIer?

1214
01:28:45,624 --> 01:28:48,388
-Do I know you?
-You babysat me!

1215
01:28:49,395 --> 01:28:53,388
Oh, my God! LittIe Stevie Fisher?
How have you been?

1216
01:28:53,432 --> 01:28:54,626
Good. I'm a Iawyer now.

1217
01:28:55,534 --> 01:28:57,627
You can't be a Iawyer.
You're 8.

1218
01:28:58,404 --> 01:29:00,599
Nice to see you.
I gotta run backstage.

1219
01:29:00,706 --> 01:29:03,641
-Backstage?
-My firm represents the band.

1220
01:29:04,443 --> 01:29:06,434
-Ross.
-ChandIer.

1221
01:29:07,579 --> 01:29:10,343
-You wanna meet the group?
-Yeah!

1222
01:29:10,449 --> 01:29:11,438
Come on.

1223
01:29:11,483 --> 01:29:15,385
Are you one of the ones
that fooIed around with my dad?

1224
01:29:20,459 --> 01:29:21,448
Hey, you guys!

1225
01:29:21,493 --> 01:29:25,554
-Happy birthday!
-Thank you.

1226
01:29:27,466 --> 01:29:29,457
How was your night Iast night?

1227
01:29:29,568 --> 01:29:33,368
It pretty much sucked.
How was yours?

1228
01:29:33,472 --> 01:29:37,568
Ours sucked too. But I ran into
Stevie Fisher. Remember him?

1229
01:29:38,377 --> 01:29:42,609
Oh, yeah! I used to babysit him.
How's his dad?

1230
01:29:44,383 --> 01:29:45,475
Good.

1231
01:29:45,584 --> 01:29:48,610
Aside from that,
the evening was a bust.

1232
01:29:49,421 --> 01:29:51,582
Yeah, we reaIIy missed you guys.

1233
01:29:52,391 --> 01:29:56,384
Yeah, we were just saying,
this whoIe thing is so stupid.

1234
01:29:56,428 --> 01:30:01,593
We just have to reaIIy not Iet stuff
Iike this about money, get Iike--

1235
01:30:01,633 --> 01:30:04,431
Is that a hickey?

1236
01:30:05,404 --> 01:30:06,701
No, I just....

1237
01:30:07,439 --> 01:30:09,498
I feII down.

1238
01:30:10,709 --> 01:30:13,507
On someone's Iips?

1239
01:30:14,413 --> 01:30:17,507
-Where'd you get the hickey?
-You know, a party or--

1240
01:30:17,549 --> 01:30:21,417
-What party?
-It wasn't a party so much as...

1241
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:24,421
...a gathering of peopIe.

1242
01:30:24,623 --> 01:30:29,560
With food and music and the band.

1243
01:30:29,628 --> 01:30:32,563
You partied with
Hootie and the BIowfish?

1244
01:30:32,631 --> 01:30:36,567
Yes. ApparentIy,
Stevie and Hootie are Iike this:

1245
01:30:36,668 --> 01:30:39,432
Who gave you that hickey?

1246
01:30:39,471 --> 01:30:42,440
That wouId be the work of a BIowfish.

1247
01:30:44,643 --> 01:30:47,635
I can't beIieve it!
I can't beIieve this!

1248
01:30:47,746 --> 01:30:53,651
We're just sitting at home,
trying to guess Joey's fingers...

1249
01:30:53,685 --> 01:30:57,587
...and you guys are out Iike partying
and having fun and aII:

1250
01:30:57,689 --> 01:31:00,681
''Hey, BIowfish, suck on my neck!''

1251
01:31:03,495 --> 01:31:06,396
Don't bIame us.
You couId've been there.

1252
01:31:06,432 --> 01:31:10,528
What? As part of your
poor friends outreach program?

1253
01:31:11,403 --> 01:31:12,495
Great, it's work.

1254
01:31:12,538 --> 01:31:16,440
I don't know what to say.
Sorry we make more than you.

1255
01:31:16,542 --> 01:31:19,534
We're not gonna feeI guiIty.
We work hard.

1256
01:31:19,645 --> 01:31:21,510
And we don't work hard?

1257
01:31:21,613 --> 01:31:23,513
It's Monica. You paged?

1258
01:31:23,549 --> 01:31:27,610
It's just that we Iike doing stuff
that costs a IittIe more.

1259
01:31:27,653 --> 01:31:30,622
-And you feeI Iike we hoId you back.
-Yes!

1260
01:31:31,423 --> 01:31:32,515
No!

1261
01:31:35,527 --> 01:31:38,519
Leon, wait. Guys!

1262
01:31:38,630 --> 01:31:43,431
I don't understand. The steaks were
a gift from the meat vendor.

1263
01:31:43,469 --> 01:31:46,563
That was not a kickback.
I'II just repIace them...

1264
01:31:46,638 --> 01:31:49,539
...and we can forget the whoIe thing.

1265
01:31:51,477 --> 01:31:53,570
What corporate poIicy?

1266
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:55,538
No--

1267
01:31:58,550 --> 01:31:59,574
Yeah.

1268
01:32:00,452 --> 01:32:01,544
Okay.

1269
01:32:06,592 --> 01:32:08,617
I just got fired.

1270
01:32:14,433 --> 01:32:18,529
-Here's your check. That'II be $4.1 2.
-Let me get that.

1271
01:32:21,707 --> 01:32:24,505
You got 5 bucks?

1272
01:32:32,718 --> 01:32:36,415
<i>Here comes the beep.</i>
<i>You know what to do.</i>

1273
01:32:36,455 --> 01:32:38,616
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

1274
01:32:41,527 --> 01:32:44,553
<i>Listen, Bob.</i>
<i>I'm probably way out of line here.</i>

1275
01:32:44,663 --> 01:32:48,622
<i>It's been three years,</i>
<i>and you're probably seeing someone...</i>

1276
01:32:48,734 --> 01:32:52,636
<i>...but if we could have one night,</i>
<i>for old times' sake....</i>

1277
01:32:52,671 --> 01:32:57,631
<i>One hot, steamy, wild night....</i>
