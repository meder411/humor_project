969
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:41,170
No, no, we're done!

970
01:13:43,311 --> 01:13:45,336
The One With the Dozen Lasagnas

971
01:14:29,357 --> 01:14:32,155
Aunt Silv, stop yelling!

972
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:35,194
lf you'd told me
vegetarian lasagna...

973
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:37,389
...l would've made
vegetarian lasagna.

974
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:42,394
The meat's only every third layer.
Maybe you could scrape.

975
01:14:43,404 --> 01:14:46,339
Ross, did you really read
all these baby boolks?

976
01:14:47,141 --> 01:14:51,134
You could plunlk me down in
any woman's uterus, no compass...

977
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:54,274
...and l could find my way
out lilke that!

978
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:56,306
This is cool.

979
01:14:57,118 --> 01:15:01,214
lt says in some parts of the world
people eat the placenta.

980
01:15:03,157 --> 01:15:05,216
And we're done with the yogurt.

981
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:08,117
Sorry.

982
01:15:08,329 --> 01:15:12,129
l did this as a favor.
l am not a caterer.

983
01:15:12,233 --> 01:15:15,327
What do you want me to do
with a dozen lasagnas?

984
01:15:16,237 --> 01:15:18,330
Nice tallk, Aunt Silv.

985
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,367
You lkiss Uncle Freddie
with that mouth?

986
01:15:22,376 --> 01:15:27,370
Ross, listen. Do you lknow that right
now your baby is only this big?

987
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:30,140
This is your baby.
''Hi, Daddy.''

988
01:15:30,351 --> 01:15:31,340
Hello.

989
01:15:32,186 --> 01:15:35,155
''How come you don't live with Mommy?''

990
01:15:36,357 --> 01:15:39,349
''How come Mommy lives
with that other lady?''

991
01:15:44,231 --> 01:15:46,222
''What's a lesbian?''

992
01:15:51,238 --> 01:15:53,297
Honey, you can say it. Poconos.

993
01:15:53,407 --> 01:15:58,208
Poconos. lt's lilke ''polke a nose.''

994
01:16:00,214 --> 01:16:03,206
Polke a nose.

995
01:16:11,325 --> 01:16:14,158
-So did l hear Poconos?
-Yes.

996
01:16:14,261 --> 01:16:17,321
My sister's giving us her place
for the weelkend.

997
01:16:18,132 --> 01:16:19,326
First weelkend together.

998
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:22,164
-lt's a big step.
-l lknow.

999
01:16:23,170 --> 01:16:27,266
-lt's just a weelkend. Big deal.
-Wasn't this supposed to be a fling?

1000
01:16:27,441 --> 01:16:29,238
Shouldn't it be...

1001
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:31,276
...flung by now?

1002
01:16:32,246 --> 01:16:34,237
We are way past a ''fling.''

1003
01:16:34,348 --> 01:16:38,341
l'm feeling things l've read about
in Danielle Steel boolks.

1004
01:16:38,452 --> 01:16:41,353
When l'm with him,
l'm just totally....

1005
01:16:42,123 --> 01:16:44,284
Nauseous.
l'm physically nauseous.

1006
01:16:45,326 --> 01:16:49,126
What am l supposed to do?
Call lmmigration?

1007
01:16:50,131 --> 01:16:51,393
l could call lmmigration.

1008
01:16:57,104 --> 01:16:58,196
What?

1009
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,141
Ugly Nalked Guy is malking
shadow puppets.

1010
01:17:04,111 --> 01:17:05,408
Loolk, it's Abraham Lincoln.

1011
01:17:07,248 --> 01:17:08,340
Oh, right!

1012
01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:11,311
Go. Go!

1013
01:17:17,124 --> 01:17:20,252
l love babies with
their little baby shoes...

1014
01:17:20,361 --> 01:17:24,354
...and their little baby toes
and their little hands....

1015
01:17:25,132 --> 01:17:28,260
Olkay, you're gonna have to stop that.
Forever.

1016
01:17:38,345 --> 01:17:40,142
Need a new table.

1017
01:17:40,381 --> 01:17:42,110
You thinlk?

1018
01:17:49,223 --> 01:17:51,214
-Come on in.
-Hello.

1019
01:17:51,325 --> 01:17:53,190
l brought the boolks...

1020
01:17:53,327 --> 01:17:57,127
...and Monica sends her love
along with this lasagna.

1021
01:17:57,198 --> 01:18:01,191
Great! ls it vegetarian?
Because Susan doesn't eat meat.

1022
01:18:03,237 --> 01:18:05,296
l'm pretty sure that it is.

1023
01:18:10,211 --> 01:18:14,113
Nineteen weelks, the breasts
are starting to swell.

1024
01:18:15,216 --> 01:18:17,241
According to the literature.

1025
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:21,220
-l got the results of the amnio.
-Tell me. ls everything...?

1026
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:25,315
-Totally and completely healthy.
-That is great!

1027
01:18:31,131 --> 01:18:33,326
When did you and Susan
meet Huey Lewis?

1028
01:18:34,134 --> 01:18:36,125
That's our friend Tanya.

1029
01:18:45,279 --> 01:18:48,077
Of course, it's your friend Tanya.

1030
01:18:50,184 --> 01:18:54,120
-Don't you wanna lknow about the sex?
-The sex?

1031
01:18:55,289 --> 01:19:00,090
l'm having enough trouble with
the image of you and Susan together.

1032
01:19:00,127 --> 01:19:02,186
But when you throw in Tanya....

1033
01:19:05,132 --> 01:19:07,225
The sex of the baby, Ross.

1034
01:19:09,303 --> 01:19:11,294
You lknow the sex of the baby?

1035
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:14,300
-Want to lknow?
-No.

1036
01:19:15,109 --> 01:19:17,134
l don't want to. Absolutely not.

1037
01:19:17,211 --> 01:19:20,203
You shouldn't lknow until
you loolk down there...

1038
01:19:20,314 --> 01:19:22,248
...and see, ''Oh, there it is.''

1039
01:19:23,150 --> 01:19:24,310
Or isn't.

1040
01:19:27,254 --> 01:19:29,347
-Hello, Ross.
-Susan.

1041
01:19:30,157 --> 01:19:31,124
So?

1042
01:19:31,358 --> 01:19:33,121
So did you hear?

1043
01:19:33,227 --> 01:19:35,218
Yes, we did.
Everything's A-Olkay.

1044
01:19:35,329 --> 01:19:38,127
Oh, that's so cool!

1045
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:40,325
lt really is.

1046
01:19:41,168 --> 01:19:42,100
Do we lknow?

1047
01:19:42,269 --> 01:19:45,204
We certainly do.
lt's going to be a--

1048
01:19:45,272 --> 01:19:46,261
Hello?

1049
01:19:46,373 --> 01:19:50,207
A guy who doesn't wanna lknow
is standing here.

1050
01:19:51,312 --> 01:19:54,304
Well, is it what
we thought it would be?

1051
01:20:01,288 --> 01:20:03,119
What--?

1052
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:05,224
What did we thinlk it'd be?

1053
01:20:06,193 --> 01:20:08,320
l don't wanna lknow.
Don't wanna lknow.

1054
01:20:09,129 --> 01:20:10,323
l should probably just go.

1055
01:20:11,198 --> 01:20:14,326
-Well, thanlks for the boolks.
-No problem. Olkay.

1056
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:19,129
Susan.

1057
01:20:24,311 --> 01:20:29,112
Who should we call first?
Your follks or Deb and Rhona?

1058
01:20:32,419 --> 01:20:34,148
Hello?

1059
01:20:36,223 --> 01:20:38,248
<i>Never mind.</i>
<i>I don't wanna know.</i>

1060
01:20:39,326 --> 01:20:43,092
Because it was my table,
l have to buy a new one?

1061
01:20:43,163 --> 01:20:47,099
-That's the rule.
-What rule? There's no rule.

1062
01:20:47,167 --> 01:20:50,295
-You owe me a table.
-How did you get there?

1063
01:20:51,071 --> 01:20:56,065
lt was fine until your brealkfast
adventure with Angela Delvecio.

1064
01:20:56,210 --> 01:20:58,075
You lknew about that?

1065
01:20:58,178 --> 01:21:02,205
The impressions in the butter
left little to the imagination.

1066
01:21:03,183 --> 01:21:05,117
How about if we split it?

1067
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:09,112
-What do you mean, buy it together?
-Yeah.

1068
01:21:09,289 --> 01:21:13,316
-Do you thinlk we're ready for that?
-Why not?

1069
01:21:14,094 --> 01:21:18,087
lt's a big commitment.
What if one of us wants to move out?

1070
01:21:18,132 --> 01:21:20,123
-You're moving out?
-l'm not.

1071
01:21:20,234 --> 01:21:22,327
-You'd tell me if you were, right?
-Yes.

1072
01:21:23,103 --> 01:21:27,233
-lt's just, with my last roommate--
-l lknow all about Kip.

1073
01:21:27,307 --> 01:21:32,301
We bought a hibachi, then he ran off
and got married. Things got ugly.

1074
01:21:33,113 --> 01:21:37,311
Let me aslk you something.
Was Kip a better roommate than me?

1075
01:21:38,118 --> 01:21:39,346
Oh, don't do that.

1076
01:21:45,292 --> 01:21:48,056
There's changes in your schedule.

1077
01:21:48,095 --> 01:21:51,155
Your 4:00 herbal massage is at 4:0.

1078
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:54,190
And Miss Summerfield
canceled her 5:0 shiatsu.

1079
01:21:54,301 --> 01:21:55,290
Thanlks.

1080
01:21:56,170 --> 01:21:58,070
Oh, here comes your :00.

1081
01:21:58,205 --> 01:22:02,107
l don't mean to sound unprofessional,
but-- Yum!

1082
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:09,172
Paolo! Hi! What are you doing here?

1083
01:22:11,185 --> 01:22:14,279
Rachella tell me you...

1084
01:22:15,222 --> 01:22:16,189
...massage?

1085
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:19,115
Well, Rachella's right.

1086
01:22:24,097 --> 01:22:25,121
Oh, olkay.

1087
01:22:25,232 --> 01:22:28,292
l don't lknow what you just said,
so let's start.

1088
01:22:30,204 --> 01:22:31,193
l am...

1089
01:22:32,206 --> 01:22:34,197
...being nalked?

1090
01:22:34,341 --> 01:22:38,209
That's your decision.
Some people prefer to talke off--

1091
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:41,305
Being nalked!

1092
01:22:43,150 --> 01:22:47,143
l can't believe you don't
wanna lknow. l couldn't not lknow.

1093
01:22:47,221 --> 01:22:50,156
lf the doctor lknows,
Carol and Susan lknow--

1094
01:22:50,324 --> 01:22:52,121
And Monica lknows.

1095
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:55,125
How? l don't even lknow.

1096
01:22:55,229 --> 01:22:58,323
Carol called to thanlk me
for the lasagna. She told me.

1097
01:22:59,132 --> 01:23:00,360
So what's it gonna be?

1098
01:23:04,137 --> 01:23:08,267
-Oh, great! Now he lknows.
-l'm just excited about being an aunt.

1099
01:23:08,342 --> 01:23:11,175
Or an uncle.

1100
01:23:15,282 --> 01:23:17,341
-Hey, Phoebe.
-Hey, Pheebs.

1101
01:23:17,384 --> 01:23:18,373
Fine!

1102
01:23:22,155 --> 01:23:25,352
-What's the matter?
-Nothing. l'm just out of sorts.

1103
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:29,361
Well, you can use some of my sorts.
l rarely use them.

1104
01:23:30,163 --> 01:23:32,290
Can we get some cappuccino
over here?

1105
01:23:34,201 --> 01:23:35,361
Oh, right! That's me!

1106
01:23:37,271 --> 01:23:40,263
That table place closes at 7. Come on.

1107
01:23:40,374 --> 01:23:41,398
Fine.

1108
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:44,334
What is it?

1109
01:23:46,146 --> 01:23:50,105
-All right. You lknow Paolo?
-l'm familiar with his worlk.

1110
01:23:51,218 --> 01:23:53,118
He made a move on me.

1111
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:56,348
-The store will be open tomorrow.
-More coffee, please.

1112
01:23:58,325 --> 01:24:00,122
Well, what happened?

1113
01:24:00,227 --> 01:24:04,220
He came in for a massage,
and everything was fine until....

1114
01:24:08,335 --> 01:24:10,269
-Oh, my God.
-Are you sure?

1115
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:14,163
Oh, yeah. l'm sure.

1116
01:24:18,145 --> 01:24:22,138
And all of a sudden, his hands
weren't the problem anymore.

1117
01:24:26,253 --> 01:24:27,242
Was it...?

1118
01:24:27,354 --> 01:24:30,346
Boy Scouts could've camped
under there.

1119
01:24:34,294 --> 01:24:35,283
Wow.

1120
01:24:35,395 --> 01:24:39,263
-What did you do?
-l dealt with it lilke a professional.

1121
01:24:45,339 --> 01:24:47,204
''Ooh,'' what?

1122
01:24:47,307 --> 01:24:48,296
--ma Thurman.

1123
01:24:48,408 --> 01:24:51,104
-The actress!
-Uma Thurman!

1124
01:24:52,212 --> 01:24:53,201
Thanlks, Rach.

1125
01:24:56,216 --> 01:24:58,309
-What'll you do?
-You have to tell her.

1126
01:24:58,352 --> 01:25:03,255
lt's your moral obligation as a friend,
as a woman. lt's a feminist issue.

1127
01:25:03,323 --> 01:25:04,312
Guys?

1128
01:25:05,125 --> 01:25:08,219
-You have to.
-Feminist issue? That's where l went.

1129
01:25:10,263 --> 01:25:13,232
-She is gonna hate me!
-Yeah, well....

1130
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:23,138
Will you piclk one?
Just piclk one.

1131
01:25:23,176 --> 01:25:27,169
-Here, how about that one?
-That's patio furniture.

1132
01:25:27,347 --> 01:25:32,182
So what? Lilke people will come in
and thinlk, ''Oh, l'm outside again.''

1133
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:33,241
Fine.

1134
01:25:34,154 --> 01:25:35,280
What about the birds?

1135
01:25:36,456 --> 01:25:41,359
l don't lknow. They don't say,
''Hello, sit here. Eat something.''

1136
01:25:42,329 --> 01:25:45,321
-You piclk one.
-Olkay. How about the ladybugs?

1137
01:25:46,133 --> 01:25:50,194
Forget about the birds, but big red
insects suggest fine dining.

1138
01:25:50,303 --> 01:25:54,399
-Fine! Want the birds? Get the birds!
-Not lilke that, l won't.

1139
01:25:58,111 --> 01:26:00,204
Kip would have lilked the birds.

1140
01:26:11,158 --> 01:26:13,149
-Hi, Pheebs.
-What's going on?

1141
01:26:13,226 --> 01:26:17,128
-Are you moving out?
-l'm getting ready for the weelkend.

1142
01:26:18,331 --> 01:26:21,232
Are your weelkends longer
than two days?

1143
01:26:22,169 --> 01:26:24,137
These aren't all my suitcases.

1144
01:26:24,237 --> 01:26:25,329
This one's Paolo's.

1145
01:26:29,176 --> 01:26:33,135
-Rachel, can we tallk for a sec?
-Well, sure.

1146
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:35,341
Just for a sec, Paolo's on his way.

1147
01:26:48,095 --> 01:26:50,290
We haven't lknown each other that long.

1148
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:53,231
There are three things
you should lknow:

1149
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:58,134
One, my friends are the most
important thing in my life.

1150
01:26:58,238 --> 01:27:00,206
Two, l never lie.

1151
01:27:01,141 --> 01:27:05,202
And three, l malke the best
oatmeal raisin coolkies in the world.

1152
01:27:07,314 --> 01:27:10,249
Olkay. Thanlks, Pheebs.

1153
01:27:15,322 --> 01:27:18,155
-Oh, my God!
-l lknow.

1154
01:27:18,258 --> 01:27:20,317
Why have l never tasted these?

1155
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:25,320
l don't malke them a lot, because
it's not fair to the other coolkies.

1156
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:34,363
These are the best
oatmeal raisin coolkies.

1157
01:27:35,175 --> 01:27:38,338
-Which proves that l never lie.
-l guess you don't.

1158
01:27:39,246 --> 01:27:41,339
Paolo made a pass at me.

1159
01:27:44,084 --> 01:27:45,176
What do you thinlk?

1160
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:48,187
lt's the most beautiful table
l've seen.

1161
01:27:48,288 --> 01:27:49,277
l lknow.

1162
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:52,285
Will you balance plates
on these heads?

1163
01:27:53,093 --> 01:27:55,288
Who cares? We'll eat at the sinlk.
Come on!

1164
01:27:58,098 --> 01:27:59,190
Heads up, Ross.

1165
01:27:59,299 --> 01:28:01,392
Score! You suclk!

1166
01:28:05,138 --> 01:28:06,196
Are you olkay?

1167
01:28:09,242 --> 01:28:10,334
l need some millk.

1168
01:28:12,312 --> 01:28:14,303
Olkay. l've got millk.

1169
01:28:19,319 --> 01:28:21,116
Here you go.

1170
01:28:29,329 --> 01:28:31,126
Better?

1171
01:28:32,332 --> 01:28:33,356
No.

1172
01:28:36,236 --> 01:28:41,333
l feel so stupid! l thinlk about
the other day with you guys.

1173
01:28:41,374 --> 01:28:45,174
And l was all, ''Oh, Paolo!
He's so great!

1174
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:47,178
He malkes me feel so--''

1175
01:28:48,114 --> 01:28:49,172
God!

1176
01:28:50,083 --> 01:28:51,209
l'm so embarrassed!

1177
01:28:51,318 --> 01:28:53,183
l'm so embarrassed.

1178
01:28:53,286 --> 01:28:57,086
-l'm the one he hit on.
-l unleashed him on you.

1179
01:28:57,123 --> 01:28:59,091
lf l had never met him--

1180
01:28:59,192 --> 01:29:01,183
-l'm so sorry.
-No, l'm sorry.

1181
01:29:01,294 --> 01:29:03,319
-l'm sorry.
-l'm sorry. Wait.

1182
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:06,291
-What are we sorry about?
-l don't lknow.

1183
01:29:06,399 --> 01:29:08,333
Right. He's the pig.

1184
01:29:09,135 --> 01:29:11,330
-Such a pig!
-Oh, God, he's such a pig!

1185
01:29:12,105 --> 01:29:15,233
He's lilke a big disgusting pig....

1186
01:29:15,342 --> 01:29:18,106
-Pig man!
-Yes, good!

1187
01:29:22,215 --> 01:29:25,207
But he was my pig man!

1188
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:28,310
How did l not see this?

1189
01:29:30,223 --> 01:29:31,247
Oh, l lknow!

1190
01:29:34,327 --> 01:29:35,351
Because...

1191
01:29:36,329 --> 01:29:38,126
...he's gorgeous.

1192
01:29:38,231 --> 01:29:39,357
And he's charming.

1193
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:42,293
-And when he loolks--
-Olkay, Pheebs.

1194
01:29:43,069 --> 01:29:44,195
The end.

1195
01:29:47,073 --> 01:29:48,062
God.

1196
01:29:50,076 --> 01:29:52,067
Should l not have told you?

1197
01:29:52,312 --> 01:29:56,112
Trust me, it's much better
that l lknow.

1198
01:29:59,219 --> 01:30:03,178
But l just lilked it better before.
lt was better.

1199
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:24,099
She toolk it pretty well.
Paolo's over there now, so....

1200
01:30:24,244 --> 01:30:28,305
We should go and see if she's olkay.
Just one second.

1201
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:32,243
-Score!
-Game! Nice!

1202
01:30:34,354 --> 01:30:36,117
Come on, Pheebs.

1203
01:30:37,324 --> 01:30:40,316
Well, it loolks lilke we
lkiclked your butts.

1204
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:45,059
She did. You could be on the Olympic
''Standing There'' team.

1205
01:30:45,098 --> 01:30:46,190
Come on. Two on one.

1206
01:30:46,299 --> 01:30:49,166
Why are you here?
She just brolke up with him.

1207
01:30:49,269 --> 01:30:51,362
lt's time for you to swoop in.

1208
01:30:52,272 --> 01:30:55,173
-What, now?
-Yes. Now is when you swoop.

1209
01:30:55,208 --> 01:30:59,167
When Paolo wallks out,
you gotta be the first guy she sees.

1210
01:30:59,279 --> 01:31:04,182
She's gotta lknow you're everything
he's not. You're the anti-Paolo.

1211
01:31:06,119 --> 01:31:08,087
My Catholic friend is right.

1212
01:31:08,188 --> 01:31:10,315
She's distraught.
You're there for her.

1213
01:31:11,091 --> 01:31:16,324
You piclk up the pieces and then
you usher in ''The Age of Ross.''

1214
01:31:23,303 --> 01:31:26,204
-See this? See?
-Hold it! <i>Ascolta</i>!

1215
01:31:29,309 --> 01:31:31,300
-How's it going?
-Don't stare.

1216
01:31:31,344 --> 01:31:36,304
She threw his clothes off the balcony.
Now there's gesturing and arm-waving.

1217
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:40,245
That is, ''How could you?''
or ''Enormous breasts!''

1218
01:31:42,255 --> 01:31:44,155
Here he comes.

1219
01:31:54,267 --> 01:31:56,064
l am...

1220
01:31:56,269 --> 01:31:58,100
...to say goodbye.

1221
01:31:58,271 --> 01:32:00,102
Olkay, bye-bye.

1222
01:32:03,276 --> 01:32:09,078
Paolo, l really hate you for what you
did, but l still have five of these...

1223
01:32:09,115 --> 01:32:12,084
...so heat it at 75
until the cheese bubbles.

1224
01:32:16,322 --> 01:32:21,316
l just wanna tell you, and l thinlk
l'd spealk for everyone when l say....

1225
01:32:28,201 --> 01:32:30,135
Oh, just loolk at her.

1226
01:32:30,236 --> 01:32:32,397
Guys, l thinlk only one of us
should go...

1227
01:32:33,139 --> 01:32:35,232
-...so she's not overwhelmed.
-Right.

1228
01:32:35,308 --> 01:32:38,141
And l really thinlk it should be me.

1229
01:32:55,128 --> 01:32:56,220
You all right?

1230
01:32:57,230 --> 01:32:59,164
l've been better.

1231
01:33:00,266 --> 01:33:02,234
l don't believe this.

1232
01:33:03,169 --> 01:33:06,161
l wasn't supposed to care
about this guy.

1233
01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:11,142
lt was just supposed to be
this big, fun, ltalian thing.

1234
01:33:11,377 --> 01:33:16,337
Someday l could loolk baclk and say,
''That was a big, fun, ltalian thing.''

1235
01:33:18,184 --> 01:33:21,381
lt wasn't supposed to feel
lilke this when it was over.

1236
01:33:24,257 --> 01:33:25,281
Come here.

1237
01:33:32,365 --> 01:33:34,196
Listen...

1238
01:33:34,267 --> 01:33:37,259
...you deserve
so much better than him.

1239
01:33:37,370 --> 01:33:39,361
l mean, you...

1240
01:33:40,173 --> 01:33:44,109
...should be with a guy who lknows
what he has when he has you.

1241
01:33:47,347 --> 01:33:48,336
What?

1242
01:33:49,349 --> 01:33:52,250
l'm so siclk of guys!

1243
01:33:53,219 --> 01:33:57,349
l don't want to loolk at
or thinlk about another guy.

1244
01:33:58,158 --> 01:34:01,150
l don't even want
to be near another guy.

1245
01:34:08,168 --> 01:34:10,363
Ross, you're so great.

1246
01:34:22,248 --> 01:34:24,341
-Are you all right?
-Are you olkay?

1247
01:34:25,151 --> 01:34:28,348
-Medium. Any coolkies left?
-Yeah.

1248
01:34:31,391 --> 01:34:33,188
See, Rach...

1249
01:34:33,259 --> 01:34:37,355
...l don't thinlk swearing off guys
altogether is the answer.

1250
01:34:38,164 --> 01:34:42,191
What you need is to develop a more
sophisticated screening process.

1251
01:34:44,204 --> 01:34:46,399
l just need to be by myself
for a while.

1252
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:50,303
-l just gotta figure out what l want.
-No, no.

1253
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:55,247
See, because not all guys out there
are gonna be a Paolo.

1254
01:34:55,315 --> 01:34:57,306
No, l lknow. l lknow.

1255
01:34:57,350 --> 01:35:02,117
And l'm sure your little boy's
not gonna grow up to be one.

1256
01:35:03,122 --> 01:35:05,113
-What?
-What?

1257
01:35:07,327 --> 01:35:09,124
l'm having a boy?

1258
01:35:10,129 --> 01:35:11,255
No.

1259
01:35:12,232 --> 01:35:15,326
No. ln fact, you're not having a boy.

1260
01:35:16,236 --> 01:35:18,136
l'm having a boy.

1261
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:23,241
-Huh? Am l having a boy?
-You're having a boy!

1262
01:35:23,376 --> 01:35:25,139
l'm having a boy!

1263
01:35:25,245 --> 01:35:27,236
-l'm having a boy!
-What is it?

1264
01:35:27,347 --> 01:35:30,180
l'm having a boy!
l'm having a boy!

1265
01:35:34,153 --> 01:35:35,347
We already lknew that!

1266
01:35:39,158 --> 01:35:40,352
l'm having a son.

1267
01:35:48,334 --> 01:35:51,235
Yes! And that would be a shutdown!

1268
01:35:51,304 --> 01:35:52,328
Shutout!

1269
01:35:56,209 --> 01:35:59,110
Where you going? One more game!

1270
01:35:59,145 --> 01:36:02,205
-lt's 2:0 in the morning.
-Yeah, get out!

1271
01:36:02,415 --> 01:36:05,350
You guys always hang out
in my apartment.

1272
01:36:06,152 --> 01:36:08,245
l'll only use my left hand.

1273
01:36:08,354 --> 01:36:10,322
Come on, wussies!

1274
01:36:14,327 --> 01:36:16,352
All right! Olkay! l gotta go!

1275
01:36:17,230 --> 01:36:18,254
l'm going.

1276
01:36:19,132 --> 01:36:20,224
And l'm gone.

1277
01:36:23,169 --> 01:36:25,137
-One more game?
-Oh, yeah.
