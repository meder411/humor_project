1036
01:17:54,614 --> 01:17:55,808
AII right, Phoebe?

1037
01:17:55,915 --> 01:18:00,750
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I wouId want worId peace...

1038
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:03,812
...no hunger, good things
for the rain forest.

1039
01:18:04,824 --> 01:18:06,621
And bigger boobs.

1040
01:18:07,761 --> 01:18:10,730
WeII, see, you took mine.

1041
01:18:11,664 --> 01:18:12,653
What about you?

1042
01:18:12,766 --> 01:18:17,726
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I'd make myseIf omnipotent forever.

1043
01:18:17,837 --> 01:18:22,831
There's aIways one guy. ''If I had a
wish, I'd wish for three more wishes.''

1044
01:18:24,778 --> 01:18:25,870
Hey, Joey.

1045
01:18:26,679 --> 01:18:28,943
What wouId you do
if you were omnipotent?

1046
01:18:29,682 --> 01:18:31,673
ProbabIy kiII myseIf.

1047
01:18:32,786 --> 01:18:33,844
Excuse me?

1048
01:18:33,887 --> 01:18:37,789
If IittIe Joey's dead,
then I got no reason to Iive.

1049
01:18:39,793 --> 01:18:42,887
Joey, omnipotent.

1050
01:18:43,797 --> 01:18:45,765
You are?

1051
01:18:45,865 --> 01:18:51,735
Ross, I'm sorry. I had no idea. I
thought it was a theoreticaI question.

1052
01:18:52,739 --> 01:18:54,798
The One With the George StephanopouIos

1053
01:19:41,855 --> 01:19:43,789
How does she do that?

1054
01:19:43,857 --> 01:19:46,655
I can't sIeep in a pubIic pIace.

1055
01:19:46,759 --> 01:19:48,886
Libraries, airpIanes,
movie theaters....

1056
01:19:49,696 --> 01:19:51,630
You sIept at the Grand Canyon.

1057
01:19:51,698 --> 01:19:55,691
HeIIo, Mom and Dad never took us
to the Grand Canyon.

1058
01:19:56,703 --> 01:19:58,830
Mom and Dad took us
to the Grand Canyon?

1059
01:20:00,607 --> 01:20:03,701
WouId you Iook at her?
She is so peacefuI.

1060
01:20:03,776 --> 01:20:04,834
Yeah.

1061
01:20:05,778 --> 01:20:07,746
What? What? What?

1062
01:20:07,814 --> 01:20:11,841
-Hi.
-It's okay. You just nodded off again.

1063
01:20:12,652 --> 01:20:13,641
What's going on?

1064
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:18,714
I got no sIeep Iast night. My
grandmother has a new boyfriend...

1065
01:20:19,659 --> 01:20:24,619
...and they're both kind of insecure
in bed, so-- And deaf.

1066
01:20:25,865 --> 01:20:29,767
They reassure each other
that they're having a good time.

1067
01:20:29,836 --> 01:20:33,670
You have no idea how Ioud they are.

1068
01:20:34,641 --> 01:20:37,735
-You can stay with RacheI and me.
-Thanks.

1069
01:20:37,844 --> 01:20:40,836
--95, 96, 97. See, I toId you.

1070
01:20:41,648 --> 01:20:43,946
Less than 100 steps
from our pIace to here.

1071
01:20:44,684 --> 01:20:47,676
You got way too much free time, man.

1072
01:20:47,787 --> 01:20:50,654
There's the birthday boy.

1073
01:20:50,757 --> 01:20:54,818
Hockey tickets. Rangers-Penguins
tonight and we're taking you.

1074
01:20:55,595 --> 01:20:58,621
-Happy birthday, paI!
-We Iove you, man.

1075
01:20:59,699 --> 01:21:02,793
It's funny. My birthday
was seven months ago.

1076
01:21:02,835 --> 01:21:05,702
-So?
-So you had an extra ticket...

1077
01:21:05,805 --> 01:21:08,899
...and couIdn't decide
who got to bring a date?

1078
01:21:09,642 --> 01:21:12,839
WeII, aren't we
Mr. The-GIass-Is-HaIf-Empty?

1079
01:21:13,613 --> 01:21:17,606
Oh, my God! Is today the 20th?
October 20th?

1080
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:21,711
-I hoped you wouIdn't remember.
-What's wrong with the 20th?

1081
01:21:21,754 --> 01:21:26,623
EIeven days before HaIIoween.
AII the good costumes are gone?

1082
01:21:26,726 --> 01:21:29,854
Today's the day CaroI and I first...

1083
01:21:30,663 --> 01:21:32,722
...consummated our...

1084
01:21:32,765 --> 01:21:35,632
...physicaI reIationship.

1085
01:21:35,868 --> 01:21:37,836
Sex.

1086
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:45,643
-You toId your sister that?
-BeIieve me, I toId everyone.

1087
01:21:45,845 --> 01:21:47,745
I better pass on the game.

1088
01:21:47,847 --> 01:21:52,807
I'm just gonna go home and think about
my ex-wife and her Iesbian Iover.

1089
01:21:53,786 --> 01:21:56,778
The heII with hockey!
Let's aII do that!

1090
01:21:58,691 --> 01:22:02,593
Come on, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice!
Guys' night out!

1091
01:22:02,629 --> 01:22:04,790
Come on, what do you say, big guy?

1092
01:22:04,831 --> 01:22:07,698
-What are you doing?
-I have no idea.

1093
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:12,601
-Come on, Ross.
-Maybe it wiII take my mind off it.

1094
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:15,699
-Promise to buy me a big foam finger?
-You got it.

1095
01:22:15,808 --> 01:22:18,743
Look, Iook, Iook! My first paycheck!

1096
01:22:18,811 --> 01:22:23,714
Look at the window!
There's my name! Hi, me!

1097
01:22:24,617 --> 01:22:26,744
I remember when
I got my first paycheck.

1098
01:22:26,819 --> 01:22:30,846
There was a cave-in in a mine,
and eight peopIe were kiIIed.

1099
01:22:32,659 --> 01:22:36,857
-You worked in a mine?
-No, I worked at a Dairy Queen. Why?

1100
01:22:39,866 --> 01:22:45,736
Isn't this exciting? I earned this.
I wiped tabIes for it. I steamed miIk.

1101
01:22:45,772 --> 01:22:47,831
And it was totaIIy...

1102
01:22:47,874 --> 01:22:50,638
...not worth it.

1103
01:22:50,743 --> 01:22:54,611
What's FICA?
Why's he getting aII my money?

1104
01:22:55,581 --> 01:22:58,709
I mean, what--?
ChandIer, Iook at that.

1105
01:22:59,585 --> 01:23:01,678
This is not that bad.

1106
01:23:01,721 --> 01:23:04,690
You're fine, yeah, for a first job.

1107
01:23:04,724 --> 01:23:07,625
You can totaIIy,
totaIIy Iive on this.

1108
01:23:07,694 --> 01:23:09,787
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1109
01:23:09,829 --> 01:23:13,822
-By the way, great service today.
-Yeah.

1110
01:23:17,704 --> 01:23:19,831
-Hockey!
-Hockey!

1111
01:23:30,817 --> 01:23:33,615
-Hockey!
-Hockey.

1112
01:23:34,821 --> 01:23:36,812
RacheI?

1113
01:23:37,824 --> 01:23:40,622
Oh, my God!

1114
01:23:44,864 --> 01:23:49,631
I swear I've seen birds
do this on <i>Wild Kingdom.</i>

1115
01:23:49,669 --> 01:23:50,863
What are you doing here?

1116
01:23:51,604 --> 01:23:56,803
We were in the city shopping, and your
mom said you work here, and it's true!

1117
01:23:58,811 --> 01:24:03,680
Look at you in the apron.
You Iook Iike you're in a pIay.

1118
01:24:05,685 --> 01:24:08,779
God, Iook at you! You're so big!
I can't beIieve it!

1119
01:24:08,888 --> 01:24:12,722
I know, I know! I'm a dupIex.

1120
01:24:12,825 --> 01:24:18,695
IKiki, you Iook phenomenaI. I mean,
you've Iost, Iike, a ton of weight.

1121
01:24:18,798 --> 01:24:20,732
And you shouId...

1122
01:24:21,601 --> 01:24:24,900
...reaIIy, reaIIy-- It's time to stop,
you Iook perfect.

1123
01:24:25,638 --> 01:24:26,798
What's going on?

1124
01:24:26,839 --> 01:24:30,900
WeII, guess who my dad's
making partner in his firm?

1125
01:24:34,614 --> 01:24:36,912
And whiIe we're on
the subject of news....

1126
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:42,815
Look, Iook! I have eIbows!

1127
01:24:47,860 --> 01:24:50,727
--Passes it up to Leetch.

1128
01:24:50,830 --> 01:24:53,799
Leetch spots Messier. Here's the pass!

1129
01:24:55,568 --> 01:24:59,698
We'II take a time-out whiIe Messier
Iooks at some women's shoes.

1130
01:24:59,772 --> 01:25:04,766
CaroI was wearing boots just Iike
those the night that we first....

1131
01:25:04,811 --> 01:25:07,871
You know? In fact, she....

1132
01:25:08,614 --> 01:25:10,673
She never took them off.

1133
01:25:10,716 --> 01:25:13,810
It's because we-- Sorry, sorry.

1134
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:17,714
I can't beIieve--

1135
01:25:18,724 --> 01:25:20,783
-What?
-Peach pit.

1136
01:25:21,594 --> 01:25:23,585
Yes, bunny?

1137
01:25:23,796 --> 01:25:27,596
Peach pit. That night, we had--

1138
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:31,693
-Peaches?
-ActuaIIy, nectarines but....

1139
01:25:31,737 --> 01:25:33,602
CouId've been a peach.

1140
01:25:33,706 --> 01:25:38,837
Then we-- Then we got dressed
and I waIked her to...

1141
01:25:39,612 --> 01:25:42,843
...the bus stop. I'm fine.

1142
01:25:43,850 --> 01:25:46,842
Hey, that woman's got
an ass Iike CaroI's.

1143
01:25:50,857 --> 01:25:54,554
What? I thought we were
trying to find stuff.

1144
01:25:54,861 --> 01:25:57,694
Come on, you guys.
TeII me aII the dirt.

1145
01:25:57,763 --> 01:26:02,757
WeII, the biggest news is stiII you
dumping Barry at the aItar.

1146
01:26:03,870 --> 01:26:07,772
-Let's taIk reaIity for a second.
-Okay.

1147
01:26:07,807 --> 01:26:12,574
-When are you coming home?
-What? Guys, I'm not.

1148
01:26:12,678 --> 01:26:16,580
-Come on. This is us.
-I'm not.

1149
01:26:16,616 --> 01:26:20,609
This is what I'm doing now.
I've got this job.

1150
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:23,780
I even do my own Iaundry.

1151
01:26:27,793 --> 01:26:30,853
-This is what I'm doing now.
-Waitressing?

1152
01:26:31,631 --> 01:26:37,627
I'm not just waitressing.
I mean, I'm....

1153
01:26:37,703 --> 01:26:43,642
I write the speciaIs
on the speciaIs board.

1154
01:26:43,743 --> 01:26:47,736
And I take the dead fIowers
out of the vase.

1155
01:26:47,813 --> 01:26:52,750
Sometimes Arturo Iets me put the
chocoIate bIobbies on the cookies.

1156
01:26:52,785 --> 01:26:57,552
WeII, your mom didn't teII us
about the bIobbies.

1157
01:27:07,566 --> 01:27:10,558
Hey, Rach.
How was it with your friends?

1158
01:27:13,673 --> 01:27:16,699
Okay, how wouId you Iike
some Tiki Death punch?

1159
01:27:16,776 --> 01:27:19,609
-What's that?
-WeII, it's rum and--

1160
01:27:19,712 --> 01:27:21,612
Okay.

1161
01:27:23,582 --> 01:27:26,779
Since Phoebe's staying,
we'II have a sIumber party.

1162
01:27:26,886 --> 01:27:31,619
We got trashy magazines.
We got cookie dough. We got Twister.

1163
01:27:32,591 --> 01:27:37,722
And I brought Operation. But I Iost
the tweezers so we can't operate.

1164
01:27:38,698 --> 01:27:40,791
But we can prep the guy.

1165
01:27:42,735 --> 01:27:47,638
-Rach, it's the Visa card peopIe.
-Oh, God. Ask them what they want.

1166
01:27:47,707 --> 01:27:51,609
CouId you pIease teII me
what this is in reference to?

1167
01:27:51,844 --> 01:27:55,712
There's been unusuaI
activity on your account.

1168
01:27:55,815 --> 01:27:57,840
I haven't used my card in weeks.

1169
01:27:58,651 --> 01:28:00,812
That is the unusuaI activity.

1170
01:28:01,854 --> 01:28:04,721
They wanna see if you're okay.

1171
01:28:04,757 --> 01:28:08,750
They wanna know if I'm okay?
Okay, Iet's see.

1172
01:28:08,828 --> 01:28:12,764
WeII, Iet's see.
The FICA guys took aII my money.

1173
01:28:12,832 --> 01:28:16,734
Everyone is getting married
or pregnant or promoted.

1174
01:28:16,769 --> 01:28:20,830
And I'm getting coffee.
And it's not even for me!

1175
01:28:20,873 --> 01:28:25,674
If that sounds Iike I'm okay,
then teII them I'm okay. Okay?

1176
01:28:27,646 --> 01:28:32,743
RacheI has Ieft the buiIding.
Can you caII back?

1177
01:28:32,785 --> 01:28:35,686
AII right! Come on!

1178
01:28:35,855 --> 01:28:38,756
Let's pIay Twister!

1179
01:28:46,766 --> 01:28:51,703
-Sorry.
-Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

1180
01:28:51,737 --> 01:28:55,696
There was ice that night with CaroI?
PIastic seats?

1181
01:28:55,741 --> 01:28:58,733
Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?

1182
01:28:59,712 --> 01:29:02,840
No, I was just saying
we're not sitting together.

1183
01:29:03,649 --> 01:29:06,914
But now that you mention it,
there was ice that night.

1184
01:29:07,720 --> 01:29:10,712
It was the first frost.

1185
01:29:10,756 --> 01:29:12,849
Sit. Just sit down. Sit.

1186
01:29:13,626 --> 01:29:16,754
You're doing
this amazing independent thing.

1187
01:29:16,862 --> 01:29:19,626
Monica, what is so amazing?

1188
01:29:19,732 --> 01:29:23,759
I gave up, Iike, everything.
And for what?

1189
01:29:23,836 --> 01:29:27,670
-You are just Iike Jack.
-Jack from downstairs?

1190
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:30,875
No, <i>Jack and the Beanstalk.</i>

1191
01:29:31,744 --> 01:29:33,644
Ah, the other Jack.

1192
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:37,843
Right. He gave up something
but then he got those magic beans.

1193
01:29:37,883 --> 01:29:42,684
And then he woke up
and there was this big pIant...

1194
01:29:42,755 --> 01:29:45,883
...outside of his window,
fuII of possibiIities.

1195
01:29:46,692 --> 01:29:49,786
He Iived in a viIIage,
and you Iive in the ViIIage.

1196
01:29:49,862 --> 01:29:56,597
Okay. But, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow.
I gave up an orthodontist.

1197
01:29:56,702 --> 01:30:01,730
-Okay, I know I didn't Iove him....
-Oh, see, Jack did Iove the cow.

1198
01:30:02,608 --> 01:30:05,600
But, see, it was a pIan. It was cIear.

1199
01:30:05,711 --> 01:30:08,646
Everything was figured out.
Now it's Iike....

1200
01:30:08,714 --> 01:30:10,705
-FIoopy?
-Yeah.

1201
01:30:11,851 --> 01:30:15,617
We don't know where we're going.

1202
01:30:15,654 --> 01:30:20,751
It's aII gonna come together
and it's just gonna be un-fIoopy.

1203
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:23,624
Yeah, Iike that's a word.

1204
01:30:25,831 --> 01:30:30,632
Okay. But Monica, what if
it doesn't come together?

1205
01:30:31,670 --> 01:30:32,864
Pheebs?

1206
01:30:33,873 --> 01:30:37,832
WeII, because you just--
I don't Iike this question.

1207
01:30:38,744 --> 01:30:42,646
See, you guys?
What if we don't get magic beans?

1208
01:30:42,748 --> 01:30:47,651
I mean, what if aII
we've got are beans?

1209
01:30:50,756 --> 01:30:53,782
Get him! Get him! Get him!

1210
01:30:53,893 --> 01:30:56,794
Yes! You're not Iaughing now,
are you, paI?

1211
01:30:57,596 --> 01:31:01,589
AII you needed were guys
hitting each other with sticks.

1212
01:31:01,634 --> 01:31:03,727
Pass it! Pass it!

1213
01:31:03,802 --> 01:31:08,705
-He's open! He's open!
-Shoot it! Shoot it!

1214
01:31:13,712 --> 01:31:16,613
Hey, Iook, we're on that TV thing.

1215
01:31:27,626 --> 01:31:28,752
Excuse me?

1216
01:31:28,827 --> 01:31:33,628
It says to caII if you're not
satisfied with this candy bar.

1217
01:31:33,666 --> 01:31:36,726
WeII, I'm not compIeteIy satisfied.

1218
01:31:38,671 --> 01:31:41,663
WeII, the IabeI
promises nutty goodness.

1219
01:31:42,641 --> 01:31:46,873
It's an emergency. But you know that,
or we'd be in the predicament room.

1220
01:31:49,682 --> 01:31:52,674
HoId on. FiII these out.
Sit over there!

1221
01:31:52,785 --> 01:31:56,778
I don't want to make any troubIe
but I'm in a Iot of pain.

1222
01:31:56,889 --> 01:32:01,622
-My face is dented.
-WeII, you'II have to wait your turn.

1223
01:32:01,694 --> 01:32:06,688
-How Iong do you think it wiII be?
-Any minute now.

1224
01:32:08,801 --> 01:32:10,792
Hey, this--

1225
01:32:22,815 --> 01:32:27,616
I'm so sorry, you guys.
I didn't mean to bring you down.

1226
01:32:27,653 --> 01:32:32,750
No, you were right.
I don't have a pIan.

1227
01:32:34,827 --> 01:32:38,627
-Pizza guy.
-Food!

1228
01:32:38,664 --> 01:32:40,723
-Phoebe?
-What?

1229
01:32:40,766 --> 01:32:44,827
-Do you have a pIan?
-I don't even have a ''pIa.''

1230
01:32:47,673 --> 01:32:49,834
One mushroom, green pepper and onion?

1231
01:32:50,643 --> 01:32:53,771
No, no, no.
That's not what we ordered!

1232
01:32:54,580 --> 01:32:57,879
We ordered a fat-free crust
with extra cheese!

1233
01:33:00,786 --> 01:33:05,587
Wait. You're not G. StephanopouIos?
Man, my dad's gonna kiII me!

1234
01:33:05,691 --> 01:33:09,718
Wait! Did you say G. StephanopouIos?

1235
01:33:09,795 --> 01:33:14,789
Yeah, this one goes across the street.
I gave him yours. Bonehead! Bonehead!

1236
01:33:15,601 --> 01:33:18,798
When you do that,
you're onIy hitting yourseIf.

1237
01:33:20,839 --> 01:33:26,800
Was this a smaII Mediterranean guy
with curiousIy inteIIigent good Iooks?

1238
01:33:26,845 --> 01:33:30,838
-That sounds right.
-Was he wearing a stunning bIue suit?

1239
01:33:31,650 --> 01:33:34,915
-And a power tie?
-No, pretty much just a toweI.

1240
01:33:35,654 --> 01:33:39,647
-Oh, God!
-You guys want me to take this back?

1241
01:33:39,758 --> 01:33:44,661
What, are you nuts? We've got
George StephanopouIos' pizza!

1242
01:33:47,866 --> 01:33:52,667
Pheebs, who's George SnuffIeupagus?

1243
01:33:54,606 --> 01:33:56,767
That's Big Bird's friend.

1244
01:33:58,711 --> 01:34:01,805
-I see pizza!
-I want to see. Let me see.

1245
01:34:02,581 --> 01:34:04,572
HeIIo! Who are we spying on?

1246
01:34:04,683 --> 01:34:07,675
White House adviser,
CIinton's campaign guy.

1247
01:34:07,786 --> 01:34:11,586
The one with the great hair,
sexy smiIe, cute butt.

1248
01:34:11,690 --> 01:34:15,626
Oh, him! The IittIe guy.
Oh, I Iove him!

1249
01:34:15,728 --> 01:34:20,893
-Wait. Wait, I see a woman.
-TeII me it's his mother.

1250
01:34:21,633 --> 01:34:23,828
-DefiniteIy not his mother.
-Oh, no!

1251
01:34:24,603 --> 01:34:28,801
Wait, she's waIking across the fIoor.
She's waIking, she's waIking....

1252
01:34:28,841 --> 01:34:32,800
She's going for the pizza--
That's not for you, bitch!

1253
01:34:47,826 --> 01:34:52,695
We've been here for over an hour,
and peopIe Iess sick have gone in.

1254
01:34:52,798 --> 01:34:56,666
That guy with the toe thing,
who's he sIeeping with?

1255
01:34:59,605 --> 01:35:02,574
Oh, come on, Dora. Don't be mad.

1256
01:35:02,641 --> 01:35:05,576
I know we both said some things...

1257
01:35:06,578 --> 01:35:10,776
...we didn't mean but that doesn't
mean we stiII don't Iove each other.

1258
01:35:11,583 --> 01:35:14,711
You know, I feeI Iike I've Iost her.

1259
01:35:18,590 --> 01:35:20,581
-Come on, push me.
-No.

1260
01:35:20,659 --> 01:35:22,820
-Push me.
-We're gonna get in troubIe.

1261
01:35:23,595 --> 01:35:25,688
Don't be a baby. Push me. Push me.

1262
01:35:25,798 --> 01:35:31,600
AII right. I'm gonna push you, okay?
How about I push you Iike this?

1263
01:35:32,838 --> 01:35:38,799
Now you're gonna be in a wheeIchair
the rest of your Iife, paIIy-waIIy....

1264
01:35:40,746 --> 01:35:46,616
I am so very sorry. Can I sign you?

1265
01:35:48,754 --> 01:35:50,722
-Lights stiII out?
-Yeah.

1266
01:35:50,823 --> 01:35:53,690
WeII, maybe they're napping.

1267
01:35:53,759 --> 01:35:58,594
-PIease. They're having sex.
-Shut up!

1268
01:36:01,567 --> 01:36:05,765
So, what do you think George is Iike?

1269
01:36:05,804 --> 01:36:08,602
-I think he's shy.
-Yeah.

1270
01:36:08,674 --> 01:36:11,666
Yeah. I think you have
to draw him out.

1271
01:36:11,710 --> 01:36:16,704
And then when you do,
he's a preppy animaI.

1272
01:36:17,716 --> 01:36:20,685
-What do you think of the guys?
-Our guys?

1273
01:36:20,786 --> 01:36:24,586
-Yeah, our guys.
-I feeI funny taIking about that.

1274
01:36:24,690 --> 01:36:27,716
-Oh, come on.
-Okay. WeII....

1275
01:36:27,793 --> 01:36:30,694
I think Joey's Iike
a IittIe kiddie ride.

1276
01:36:30,796 --> 01:36:34,892
You just have to put the quarter in
and it just goes.

1277
01:36:36,702 --> 01:36:40,695
He might surprise you. One time,
he heIped me put on my coat...

1278
01:36:40,806 --> 01:36:43,707
...and he was reaIIy tender.

1279
01:36:43,809 --> 01:36:48,610
Come on, baby, come on. Let's go.

1280
01:36:48,714 --> 01:36:50,648
Yes!

1281
01:36:51,650 --> 01:36:56,553
ChandIer's one of those repressed guys
who you'd have to seduce.

1282
01:36:56,588 --> 01:37:01,548
I think it's an act. ChandIer is
more sophisticated than he seems.

1283
01:37:06,665 --> 01:37:08,860
-You know who's kind of sexy?
-Don't.

1284
01:37:09,601 --> 01:37:12,764
-Ross.
-No, guys. PIease, he is my brother.

1285
01:37:12,804 --> 01:37:16,706
I know exactIy what you mean.
He can be reaIIy smooth.

1286
01:37:27,819 --> 01:37:30,720
Can't you just picture him in bed?

1287
01:37:30,789 --> 01:37:32,882
I reaIIy don't want to.

1288
01:37:34,693 --> 01:37:36,627
Come on, Iaugh. Laugh.

1289
01:37:36,795 --> 01:37:41,789
I remember the moonIight coming in the
window, and her face had the most...

1290
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:43,731
...incredibIe gIow.

1291
01:37:43,835 --> 01:37:47,794
The moon, the gIow,
the magicaI feeIing. You did this.

1292
01:37:48,607 --> 01:37:51,701
CouId I get some painkiIIers
over here, pIease?

1293
01:37:51,810 --> 01:37:55,746
He's right. Enough.
What's the big deaI about today?

1294
01:37:55,814 --> 01:37:58,749
So you sIept with her
for the first time.

1295
01:37:58,817 --> 01:38:01,843
You sIept with her
for seven years after that.

1296
01:38:02,754 --> 01:38:04,847
It's a IittIe more compIicated--

1297
01:38:05,657 --> 01:38:09,855
What is it, that she Ieft you
for another woman that Iikes women?

1298
01:38:10,629 --> 01:38:15,760
Louder. There's a man on the 1 2th
fIoor in a coma who didn't hear you.

1299
01:38:18,637 --> 01:38:19,661
Then, what?

1300
01:38:20,739 --> 01:38:23,640
My first time with CaroI was...

1301
01:38:23,675 --> 01:38:25,836
...was my....

1302
01:38:26,845 --> 01:38:27,869
What?

1303
01:38:30,749 --> 01:38:35,743
It was my first time.

1304
01:38:35,887 --> 01:38:37,855
With CaroI?

1305
01:38:42,761 --> 01:38:43,853
Oh.

1306
01:38:44,796 --> 01:38:48,664
So, in your whoIe Iife,
you've onIy been with one--?

1307
01:38:49,868 --> 01:38:53,736
Oh, boy. Hockey was a big mistake.

1308
01:38:54,606 --> 01:38:57,734
There's a bunch of stuff
we couId've done tonight.

1309
01:38:59,645 --> 01:39:01,704
Okay, I got one.

1310
01:39:01,813 --> 01:39:04,839
Do you remember
that vegetarian pâté...

1311
01:39:05,617 --> 01:39:08,609
...that I made that you Ioved so much?

1312
01:39:09,621 --> 01:39:12,852
WeII, unIess goose is a vegetabIe--!

1313
01:39:15,827 --> 01:39:19,854
Now I don't feeI so bad
about sIeeping with Jason HurIey.

1314
01:39:20,666 --> 01:39:24,625
-What? You sIept with Jason?
-You had aIready broken up.

1315
01:39:24,736 --> 01:39:26,829
-How Iong?
-Just a coupIe hours.

1316
01:39:27,639 --> 01:39:31,837
-Oh, that's nice!
-Okay, okay, okay, I got one!

1317
01:39:33,845 --> 01:39:38,839
Anyway, the vaIentine Tom Ieft in
your Iocker was reaIIy from me!

1318
01:39:39,751 --> 01:39:41,685
Excuse me?

1319
01:39:41,753 --> 01:39:45,883
HeIIo! Like he was reaIIy
gonna send you one.

1320
01:39:47,659 --> 01:39:50,753
She was a big girI!

1321
01:39:51,630 --> 01:39:57,626
ReaIIy? WeII, at Ieast big girIs don't
pee in their pants in seventh grade!

1322
01:39:57,736 --> 01:40:00,705
I was Iaughing. You made me Iaugh!

1323
01:40:00,739 --> 01:40:03,606
Oh, my God! There he is! There he is!

1324
01:40:03,709 --> 01:40:06,803
-Where?
-Where we've been Iooking aII night.

1325
01:40:07,612 --> 01:40:10,604
-He's so cute.
-George, baby, drop the toweI.

1326
01:40:10,716 --> 01:40:14,812
-Come on, drop the toweI.
-Drop it. WiII you pIease drop it?

1327
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:17,616
Wow!

1328
01:40:19,858 --> 01:40:24,852
Man, can you beIieve
he's onIy had sex with one woman?

1329
01:40:25,831 --> 01:40:29,824
I think it's great.
You know, it's sweet.

1330
01:40:29,935 --> 01:40:31,926
It's romantic.

1331
01:40:32,838 --> 01:40:33,862
ReaIIy?

1332
01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:37,733
You kidding? The guy's a freak.
I judge him.

1333
01:40:37,776 --> 01:40:39,744
-Hey, man!
-Hey, buddy!

1334
01:40:43,682 --> 01:40:47,675
Oh, that's attractive.

1335
01:40:48,787 --> 01:40:52,587
I thought you were great
in <i>Silence of the Lambs.</i>

1336
01:40:53,825 --> 01:40:57,693
Admit it, aII things considered,
you had fun tonight.

1337
01:40:57,796 --> 01:41:01,630
Fun? Where was the fun?
TeII me which part was fun.

1338
01:41:01,733 --> 01:41:02,825
Where's my puck?

1339
01:41:03,602 --> 01:41:06,594
-The kid has it.
-The kid--

1340
01:41:07,606 --> 01:41:09,801
Excuse me, that's my puck.

1341
01:41:10,609 --> 01:41:14,705
I found it.
Finders keepers, Iosers weepers.

1342
01:41:17,616 --> 01:41:18,913
You gotta do it, man.

1343
01:41:19,918 --> 01:41:22,853
I'm rubber, you're gIue.
Whatever you--

1344
01:41:23,622 --> 01:41:24,850
I can't do it.

1345
01:41:25,657 --> 01:41:27,852
-Listen, give me back my puck.
-No.

1346
01:41:28,627 --> 01:41:29,821
-Yes, how about--?
-No.

1347
01:41:29,861 --> 01:41:31,829
-Give me my puck.
-No.

1348
01:41:31,863 --> 01:41:33,831
No roughhousing in my ER!
