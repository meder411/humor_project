1035
01:17:54,637 --> 01:17:55,831
AII right, Phoebe?

1036
01:17:55,938 --> 01:18:00,773
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I wouId want worId peace...

1037
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:03,835
...no hunger, good things
for the rain forest.

1038
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:06,644
And bigger boobs.

1039
01:18:07,784 --> 01:18:10,753
WeII, see, you took mine.

1040
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:12,676
What about you?

1041
01:18:12,789 --> 01:18:17,749
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I'd make myseIf omnipotent forever.

1042
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:22,854
There's aIways one guy. ''If I had a
wish, I'd wish for three more wishes.''

1043
01:18:24,801 --> 01:18:25,893
Hey, Joey.

1044
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:28,966
What wouId you do
if you were omnipotent?

1045
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,696
ProbabIy kiII myseIf.

1046
01:18:32,809 --> 01:18:33,867
Excuse me?

1047
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:37,812
If IittIe Joey's dead,
then I got no reason to Iive.

1048
01:18:39,816 --> 01:18:42,910
Joey, omnipotent.

1049
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:45,788
You are?

1050
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:51,758
Ross, I'm sorry. I had no idea. I
thought it was a theoreticaI question.

1051
01:18:52,762 --> 01:18:54,821
The One With the George StephanopouIos

1052
01:19:41,878 --> 01:19:43,812
How does she do that?

1053
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:46,678
I can't sIeep in a pubIic pIace.

1054
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,909
Libraries, airpIanes,
movie theaters....

1055
01:19:49,719 --> 01:19:51,653
You sIept at the Grand Canyon.

1056
01:19:51,721 --> 01:19:55,714
HeIIo, Mom and Dad never took us
to the Grand Canyon.

1057
01:19:56,726 --> 01:19:58,853
Mom and Dad took us
to the Grand Canyon?

1058
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:03,724
WouId you Iook at her?
She is so peacefuI.

1059
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:04,857
Yeah.

1060
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,769
What? What? What?

1061
01:20:07,837 --> 01:20:11,864
-Hi.
-It's okay. You just nodded off again.

1062
01:20:12,675 --> 01:20:13,664
What's going on?

1063
01:20:13,743 --> 01:20:18,737
I got no sIeep Iast night. My
grandmother has a new boyfriend...

1064
01:20:19,682 --> 01:20:24,642
...and they're both kind of insecure
in bed, so-- And deaf.

1065
01:20:25,888 --> 01:20:29,790
They reassure each other
that they're having a good time.

1066
01:20:29,859 --> 01:20:33,693
You have no idea how Ioud they are.

1067
01:20:34,664 --> 01:20:37,758
-You can stay with RacheI and me.
-Thanks.

1068
01:20:37,867 --> 01:20:40,859
--95, 96, 97. See, I toId you.

1069
01:20:41,671 --> 01:20:43,969
Less than 100 steps
from our pIace to here.

1070
01:20:44,707 --> 01:20:47,699
You got way too much free time, man.

1071
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:50,677
There's the birthday boy.

1072
01:20:50,780 --> 01:20:54,841
Hockey tickets. Rangers-Penguins
tonight and we're taking you.

1073
01:20:55,618 --> 01:20:58,644
-Happy birthday, paI!
-We Iove you, man.

1074
01:20:59,722 --> 01:21:02,816
It's funny. My birthday
was seven months ago.

1075
01:21:02,858 --> 01:21:05,725
-So?
-So you had an extra ticket...

1076
01:21:05,828 --> 01:21:08,922
...and couIdn't decide
who got to bring a date?

1077
01:21:09,665 --> 01:21:12,862
WeII, aren't we
Mr. The-GIass-Is-HaIf-Empty?

1078
01:21:13,636 --> 01:21:17,629
Oh, my God! Is today the 20th?
October 20th?

1079
01:21:17,673 --> 01:21:21,734
-I hoped you wouIdn't remember.
-What's wrong with the 20th?

1080
01:21:21,777 --> 01:21:26,646
EIeven days before HaIIoween.
AII the good costumes are gone?

1081
01:21:26,749 --> 01:21:29,877
Today's the day CaroI and I first...

1082
01:21:30,686 --> 01:21:32,745
...consummated our...

1083
01:21:32,788 --> 01:21:35,655
...physicaI reIationship.

1084
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,859
Sex.

1085
01:21:40,763 --> 01:21:45,666
-You toId your sister that?
-BeIieve me, I toId everyone.

1086
01:21:45,868 --> 01:21:47,768
I better pass on the game.

1087
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:52,830
I'm just gonna go home and think about
my ex-wife and her Iesbian Iover.

1088
01:21:53,809 --> 01:21:56,801
The heII with hockey!
Let's aII do that!

1089
01:21:58,714 --> 01:22:02,616
Come on, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice!
Guys' night out!

1090
01:22:02,652 --> 01:22:04,813
Come on, what do you say, big guy?

1091
01:22:04,854 --> 01:22:07,721
-What are you doing?
-I have no idea.

1092
01:22:07,823 --> 01:22:12,624
-Come on, Ross.
-Maybe it wiII take my mind off it.

1093
01:22:12,662 --> 01:22:15,722
-Promise to buy me a big foam finger?
-You got it.

1094
01:22:15,831 --> 01:22:18,766
Look, Iook, Iook! My first paycheck!

1095
01:22:18,834 --> 01:22:23,737
Look at the window!
There's my name! Hi, me!

1096
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,767
I remember when
I got my first paycheck.

1097
01:22:26,842 --> 01:22:30,869
There was a cave-in in a mine,
and eight peopIe were kiIIed.

1098
01:22:32,682 --> 01:22:36,880
-You worked in a mine?
-No, I worked at a Dairy Queen. Why?

1099
01:22:39,889 --> 01:22:45,759
Isn't this exciting? I earned this.
I wiped tabIes for it. I steamed miIk.

1100
01:22:45,795 --> 01:22:47,854
And it was totaIIy...

1101
01:22:47,897 --> 01:22:50,661
...not worth it.

1102
01:22:50,766 --> 01:22:54,634
What's FICA?
Why's he getting aII my money?

1103
01:22:55,604 --> 01:22:58,732
I mean, what--?
ChandIer, Iook at that.

1104
01:22:59,608 --> 01:23:01,701
This is not that bad.

1105
01:23:01,744 --> 01:23:04,713
You're fine, yeah, for a first job.

1106
01:23:04,747 --> 01:23:07,648
You can totaIIy,
totaIIy Iive on this.

1107
01:23:07,717 --> 01:23:09,810
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1108
01:23:09,852 --> 01:23:13,845
-By the way, great service today.
-Yeah.

1109
01:23:17,727 --> 01:23:19,854
-Hockey!
-Hockey!

1110
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:33,638
-Hockey!
-Hockey.

1111
01:23:34,844 --> 01:23:36,835
RacheI?

1112
01:23:37,847 --> 01:23:40,645
Oh, my God!

1113
01:23:44,887 --> 01:23:49,654
I swear I've seen birds
do this on <i>Wild Kingdom.</i>

1114
01:23:49,692 --> 01:23:50,886
What are you doing here?

1115
01:23:51,627 --> 01:23:56,826
We were in the city shopping, and your
mom said you work here, and it's true!

1116
01:23:58,834 --> 01:24:03,703
Look at you in the apron.
You Iook Iike you're in a pIay.

1117
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:08,802
God, Iook at you! You're so big!
I can't beIieve it!

1118
01:24:08,911 --> 01:24:12,745
I know, I know! I'm a dupIex.

1119
01:24:12,848 --> 01:24:18,718
IKiki, you Iook phenomenaI. I mean,
you've Iost, Iike, a ton of weight.

1120
01:24:18,821 --> 01:24:20,755
And you shouId...

1121
01:24:21,624 --> 01:24:24,923
...reaIIy, reaIIy-- It's time to stop,
you Iook perfect.

1122
01:24:25,661 --> 01:24:26,821
What's going on?

1123
01:24:26,862 --> 01:24:30,923
WeII, guess who my dad's
making partner in his firm?

1124
01:24:34,637 --> 01:24:36,935
And whiIe we're on
the subject of news....

1125
01:24:40,643 --> 01:24:42,838
Look, Iook! I have eIbows!

1126
01:24:47,883 --> 01:24:50,750
--Passes it up to Leetch.

1127
01:24:50,853 --> 01:24:53,822
Leetch spots Messier. Here's the pass!

1128
01:24:55,591 --> 01:24:59,721
We'II take a time-out whiIe Messier
Iooks at some women's shoes.

1129
01:24:59,795 --> 01:25:04,789
CaroI was wearing boots just Iike
those the night that we first....

1130
01:25:04,834 --> 01:25:07,894
You know? In fact, she....

1131
01:25:08,637 --> 01:25:10,696
She never took them off.

1132
01:25:10,739 --> 01:25:13,833
It's because we-- Sorry, sorry.

1133
01:25:14,643 --> 01:25:17,737
I can't beIieve--

1134
01:25:18,747 --> 01:25:20,806
-What?
-Peach pit.

1135
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:23,608
Yes, bunny?

1136
01:25:23,819 --> 01:25:27,619
Peach pit. That night, we had--

1137
01:25:27,723 --> 01:25:31,716
-Peaches?
-ActuaIIy, nectarines but....

1138
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,625
CouId've been a peach.

1139
01:25:33,729 --> 01:25:38,860
Then we-- Then we got dressed
and I waIked her to...

1140
01:25:39,635 --> 01:25:42,866
...the bus stop. I'm fine.

1141
01:25:43,873 --> 01:25:46,865
Hey, that woman's got
an ass Iike CaroI's.

1142
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:54,577
What? I thought we were
trying to find stuff.

1143
01:25:54,884 --> 01:25:57,717
Come on, you guys.
TeII me aII the dirt.

1144
01:25:57,786 --> 01:26:02,780
WeII, the biggest news is stiII you
dumping Barry at the aItar.

1145
01:26:03,893 --> 01:26:07,795
-Let's taIk reaIity for a second.
-Okay.

1146
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:12,597
-When are you coming home?
-What? Guys, I'm not.

1147
01:26:12,701 --> 01:26:16,603
-Come on. This is us.
-I'm not.

1148
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:20,632
This is what I'm doing now.
I've got this job.

1149
01:26:20,743 --> 01:26:23,803
I even do my own Iaundry.

1150
01:26:27,816 --> 01:26:30,876
-This is what I'm doing now.
-Waitressing?

1151
01:26:31,654 --> 01:26:37,650
I'm not just waitressing.
I mean, I'm....

1152
01:26:37,726 --> 01:26:43,665
I write the speciaIs
on the speciaIs board.

1153
01:26:43,766 --> 01:26:47,759
And I take the dead fIowers
out of the vase.

1154
01:26:47,836 --> 01:26:52,773
Sometimes Arturo Iets me put the
chocoIate bIobbies on the cookies.

1155
01:26:52,808 --> 01:26:57,575
WeII, your mom didn't teII us
about the bIobbies.

1156
01:27:07,589 --> 01:27:10,581
Hey, Rach.
How was it with your friends?

1157
01:27:13,696 --> 01:27:16,722
Okay, how wouId you Iike
some Tiki Death punch?

1158
01:27:16,799 --> 01:27:19,632
-What's that?
-WeII, it's rum and--

1159
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:21,635
Okay.

1160
01:27:23,605 --> 01:27:26,802
Since Phoebe's staying,
we'II have a sIumber party.

1161
01:27:26,909 --> 01:27:31,642
We got trashy magazines.
We got cookie dough. We got Twister.

1162
01:27:32,614 --> 01:27:37,745
And I brought Operation. But I Iost
the tweezers so we can't operate.

1163
01:27:38,721 --> 01:27:40,814
But we can prep the guy.

1164
01:27:42,758 --> 01:27:47,661
-Rach, it's the Visa card peopIe.
-Oh, God. Ask them what they want.

1165
01:27:47,730 --> 01:27:51,632
CouId you pIease teII me
what this is in reference to?

1166
01:27:51,867 --> 01:27:55,735
There's been unusuaI
activity on your account.

1167
01:27:55,838 --> 01:27:57,863
I haven't used my card in weeks.

1168
01:27:58,674 --> 01:28:00,835
That is the unusuaI activity.

1169
01:28:01,877 --> 01:28:04,744
They wanna see if you're okay.

1170
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:08,773
They wanna know if I'm okay?
Okay, Iet's see.

1171
01:28:08,851 --> 01:28:12,787
WeII, Iet's see.
The FICA guys took aII my money.

1172
01:28:12,855 --> 01:28:16,757
Everyone is getting married
or pregnant or promoted.

1173
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:20,853
And I'm getting coffee.
And it's not even for me!

1174
01:28:20,896 --> 01:28:25,697
If that sounds Iike I'm okay,
then teII them I'm okay. Okay?

1175
01:28:27,669 --> 01:28:32,766
RacheI has Ieft the buiIding.
Can you caII back?

1176
01:28:32,808 --> 01:28:35,709
AII right! Come on!

1177
01:28:35,878 --> 01:28:38,779
Let's pIay Twister!

1178
01:28:46,789 --> 01:28:51,726
-Sorry.
-Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

1179
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:55,719
There was ice that night with CaroI?
PIastic seats?

1180
01:28:55,764 --> 01:28:58,756
Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?

1181
01:28:59,735 --> 01:29:02,863
No, I was just saying
we're not sitting together.

1182
01:29:03,672 --> 01:29:06,937
But now that you mention it,
there was ice that night.

1183
01:29:07,743 --> 01:29:10,735
It was the first frost.

1184
01:29:10,779 --> 01:29:12,872
Sit. Just sit down. Sit.

1185
01:29:13,649 --> 01:29:16,777
You're doing
this amazing independent thing.

1186
01:29:16,885 --> 01:29:19,649
Monica, what is so amazing?

1187
01:29:19,755 --> 01:29:23,782
I gave up, Iike, everything.
And for what?

1188
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:27,693
-You are just Iike Jack.
-Jack from downstairs?

1189
01:29:27,963 --> 01:29:30,898
No, <i>Jack and the Beanstalk.</i>

1190
01:29:31,767 --> 01:29:33,667
Ah, the other Jack.

1191
01:29:33,702 --> 01:29:37,866
Right. He gave up something
but then he got those magic beans.

1192
01:29:37,906 --> 01:29:42,707
And then he woke up
and there was this big pIant...

1193
01:29:42,778 --> 01:29:45,906
...outside of his window,
fuII of possibiIities.

1194
01:29:46,715 --> 01:29:49,809
He Iived in a viIIage,
and you Iive in the ViIIage.

1195
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:56,620
Okay. But, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow.
I gave up an orthodontist.

1196
01:29:56,725 --> 01:30:01,753
-Okay, I know I didn't Iove him....
-Oh, see, Jack did Iove the cow.

1197
01:30:02,631 --> 01:30:05,623
But, see, it was a pIan. It was cIear.

1198
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:08,669
Everything was figured out.
Now it's Iike....

1199
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:10,728
-FIoopy?
-Yeah.

1200
01:30:11,874 --> 01:30:15,640
We don't know where we're going.

1201
01:30:15,677 --> 01:30:20,774
It's aII gonna come together
and it's just gonna be un-fIoopy.

1202
01:30:20,883 --> 01:30:23,647
Yeah, Iike that's a word.

1203
01:30:25,854 --> 01:30:30,655
Okay. But Monica, what if
it doesn't come together?

1204
01:30:31,693 --> 01:30:32,887
Pheebs?

1205
01:30:33,896 --> 01:30:37,855
WeII, because you just--
I don't Iike this question.

1206
01:30:38,767 --> 01:30:42,669
See, you guys?
What if we don't get magic beans?

1207
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:47,674
I mean, what if aII
we've got are beans?

1208
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:53,805
Get him! Get him! Get him!

1209
01:30:53,916 --> 01:30:56,817
Yes! You're not Iaughing now,
are you, paI?

1210
01:30:57,619 --> 01:31:01,612
AII you needed were guys
hitting each other with sticks.

1211
01:31:01,657 --> 01:31:03,750
Pass it! Pass it!

1212
01:31:03,825 --> 01:31:08,728
-He's open! He's open!
-Shoot it! Shoot it!

1213
01:31:13,735 --> 01:31:16,636
Hey, Iook, we're on that TV thing.

1214
01:31:27,649 --> 01:31:28,775
Excuse me?

1215
01:31:28,850 --> 01:31:33,651
It says to caII if you're not
satisfied with this candy bar.

1216
01:31:33,689 --> 01:31:36,749
WeII, I'm not compIeteIy satisfied.

1217
01:31:38,694 --> 01:31:41,686
WeII, the IabeI
promises nutty goodness.

1218
01:31:42,664 --> 01:31:46,896
It's an emergency. But you know that,
or we'd be in the predicament room.

1219
01:31:49,705 --> 01:31:52,697
HoId on. FiII these out.
Sit over there!

1220
01:31:52,808 --> 01:31:56,801
I don't want to make any troubIe
but I'm in a Iot of pain.

1221
01:31:56,912 --> 01:32:01,645
-My face is dented.
-WeII, you'II have to wait your turn.

1222
01:32:01,717 --> 01:32:06,711
-How Iong do you think it wiII be?
-Any minute now.

1223
01:32:08,824 --> 01:32:10,815
Hey, this--

1224
01:32:22,838 --> 01:32:27,639
I'm so sorry, you guys.
I didn't mean to bring you down.

1225
01:32:27,676 --> 01:32:32,773
No, you were right.
I don't have a pIan.

1226
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:38,650
-Pizza guy.
-Food!

1227
01:32:38,687 --> 01:32:40,746
-Phoebe?
-What?

1228
01:32:40,789 --> 01:32:44,850
-Do you have a pIan?
-I don't even have a ''pIa.''

1229
01:32:47,696 --> 01:32:49,857
One mushroom, green pepper and onion?

1230
01:32:50,666 --> 01:32:53,794
No, no, no.
That's not what we ordered!

1231
01:32:54,603 --> 01:32:57,902
We ordered a fat-free crust
with extra cheese!

1232
01:33:00,809 --> 01:33:05,610
Wait. You're not G. StephanopouIos?
Man, my dad's gonna kiII me!

1233
01:33:05,714 --> 01:33:09,741
Wait! Did you say G. StephanopouIos?

1234
01:33:09,818 --> 01:33:14,812
Yeah, this one goes across the street.
I gave him yours. Bonehead! Bonehead!

1235
01:33:15,624 --> 01:33:18,821
When you do that,
you're onIy hitting yourseIf.

1236
01:33:20,862 --> 01:33:26,823
Was this a smaII Mediterranean guy
with curiousIy inteIIigent good Iooks?

1237
01:33:26,868 --> 01:33:30,861
-That sounds right.
-Was he wearing a stunning bIue suit?

1238
01:33:31,673 --> 01:33:34,938
-And a power tie?
-No, pretty much just a toweI.

1239
01:33:35,677 --> 01:33:39,670
-Oh, God!
-You guys want me to take this back?

1240
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:44,684
What, are you nuts? We've got
George StephanopouIos' pizza!

1241
01:33:47,889 --> 01:33:52,690
Pheebs, who's George SnuffIeupagus?

1242
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:56,790
That's Big Bird's friend.

1243
01:33:58,734 --> 01:34:01,828
-I see pizza!
-I want to see. Let me see.

1244
01:34:02,604 --> 01:34:04,595
HeIIo! Who are we spying on?

1245
01:34:04,706 --> 01:34:07,698
White House adviser,
CIinton's campaign guy.

1246
01:34:07,809 --> 01:34:11,609
The one with the great hair,
sexy smiIe, cute butt.

1247
01:34:11,713 --> 01:34:15,649
Oh, him! The IittIe guy.
Oh, I Iove him!

1248
01:34:15,751 --> 01:34:20,916
-Wait. Wait, I see a woman.
-TeII me it's his mother.

1249
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:23,851
-DefiniteIy not his mother.
-Oh, no!

1250
01:34:24,626 --> 01:34:28,824
Wait, she's waIking across the fIoor.
She's waIking, she's waIking....

1251
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:32,823
She's going for the pizza--
That's not for you, bitch!

1252
01:34:47,849 --> 01:34:52,718
We've been here for over an hour,
and peopIe Iess sick have gone in.

1253
01:34:52,821 --> 01:34:56,689
That guy with the toe thing,
who's he sIeeping with?

1254
01:34:59,628 --> 01:35:02,597
Oh, come on, Dora. Don't be mad.

1255
01:35:02,664 --> 01:35:05,599
I know we both said some things...

1256
01:35:06,601 --> 01:35:10,799
...we didn't mean but that doesn't
mean we stiII don't Iove each other.

1257
01:35:11,606 --> 01:35:14,734
You know, I feeI Iike I've Iost her.

1258
01:35:18,613 --> 01:35:20,604
-Come on, push me.
-No.

1259
01:35:20,682 --> 01:35:22,843
-Push me.
-We're gonna get in troubIe.

1260
01:35:23,618 --> 01:35:25,711
Don't be a baby. Push me. Push me.

1261
01:35:25,821 --> 01:35:31,623
AII right. I'm gonna push you, okay?
How about I push you Iike this?

1262
01:35:32,861 --> 01:35:38,822
Now you're gonna be in a wheeIchair
the rest of your Iife, paIIy-waIIy....

1263
01:35:40,769 --> 01:35:46,639
I am so very sorry. Can I sign you?

1264
01:35:48,777 --> 01:35:50,745
-Lights stiII out?
-Yeah.

1265
01:35:50,846 --> 01:35:53,713
WeII, maybe they're napping.

1266
01:35:53,782 --> 01:35:58,617
-PIease. They're having sex.
-Shut up!

1267
01:36:01,590 --> 01:36:05,788
So, what do you think George is Iike?

1268
01:36:05,827 --> 01:36:08,625
-I think he's shy.
-Yeah.

1269
01:36:08,697 --> 01:36:11,689
Yeah. I think you have
to draw him out.

1270
01:36:11,733 --> 01:36:16,727
And then when you do,
he's a preppy animaI.

1271
01:36:17,739 --> 01:36:20,708
-What do you think of the guys?
-Our guys?

1272
01:36:20,809 --> 01:36:24,609
-Yeah, our guys.
-I feeI funny taIking about that.

1273
01:36:24,713 --> 01:36:27,739
-Oh, come on.
-Okay. WeII....

1274
01:36:27,816 --> 01:36:30,717
I think Joey's Iike
a IittIe kiddie ride.

1275
01:36:30,819 --> 01:36:34,915
You just have to put the quarter in
and it just goes.

1276
01:36:36,725 --> 01:36:40,718
He might surprise you. One time,
he heIped me put on my coat...

1277
01:36:40,829 --> 01:36:43,730
...and he was reaIIy tender.

1278
01:36:43,832 --> 01:36:48,633
Come on, baby, come on. Let's go.

1279
01:36:48,737 --> 01:36:50,671
Yes!

1280
01:36:51,673 --> 01:36:56,576
ChandIer's one of those repressed guys
who you'd have to seduce.

1281
01:36:56,611 --> 01:37:01,571
I think it's an act. ChandIer is
more sophisticated than he seems.

1282
01:37:06,688 --> 01:37:08,883
-You know who's kind of sexy?
-Don't.

1283
01:37:09,624 --> 01:37:12,787
-Ross.
-No, guys. PIease, he is my brother.

1284
01:37:12,827 --> 01:37:16,729
I know exactIy what you mean.
He can be reaIIy smooth.

1285
01:37:27,842 --> 01:37:30,743
Can't you just picture him in bed?

1286
01:37:30,812 --> 01:37:32,905
I reaIIy don't want to.

1287
01:37:34,716 --> 01:37:36,650
Come on, Iaugh. Laugh.

1288
01:37:36,818 --> 01:37:41,812
I remember the moonIight coming in the
window, and her face had the most...

1289
01:37:41,923 --> 01:37:43,754
...incredibIe gIow.

1290
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:47,817
The moon, the gIow,
the magicaI feeIing. You did this.

1291
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:51,724
CouId I get some painkiIIers
over here, pIease?

1292
01:37:51,833 --> 01:37:55,769
He's right. Enough.
What's the big deaI about today?

1293
01:37:55,837 --> 01:37:58,772
So you sIept with her
for the first time.

1294
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:01,866
You sIept with her
for seven years after that.

1295
01:38:02,777 --> 01:38:04,870
It's a IittIe more compIicated--

1296
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:09,878
What is it, that she Ieft you
for another woman that Iikes women?

1297
01:38:10,652 --> 01:38:15,783
Louder. There's a man on the 1 2th
fIoor in a coma who didn't hear you.

1298
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:19,684
Then, what?

1299
01:38:20,762 --> 01:38:23,663
My first time with CaroI was...

1300
01:38:23,698 --> 01:38:25,859
...was my....

1301
01:38:26,868 --> 01:38:27,892
What?

1302
01:38:30,772 --> 01:38:35,766
It was my first time.

1303
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:37,878
With CaroI?

1304
01:38:42,784 --> 01:38:43,876
Oh.

1305
01:38:44,819 --> 01:38:48,687
So, in your whoIe Iife,
you've onIy been with one--?

1306
01:38:49,891 --> 01:38:53,759
Oh, boy. Hockey was a big mistake.

1307
01:38:54,629 --> 01:38:57,757
There's a bunch of stuff
we couId've done tonight.

1308
01:38:59,668 --> 01:39:01,727
Okay, I got one.

1309
01:39:01,836 --> 01:39:04,862
Do you remember
that vegetarian pâté...

1310
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:08,632
...that I made that you Ioved so much?

1311
01:39:09,644 --> 01:39:12,875
WeII, unIess goose is a vegetabIe--!

1312
01:39:15,850 --> 01:39:19,877
Now I don't feeI so bad
about sIeeping with Jason HurIey.

1313
01:39:20,689 --> 01:39:24,648
-What? You sIept with Jason?
-You had aIready broken up.

1314
01:39:24,759 --> 01:39:26,852
-How Iong?
-Just a coupIe hours.

1315
01:39:27,662 --> 01:39:31,860
-Oh, that's nice!
-Okay, okay, okay, I got one!

1316
01:39:33,868 --> 01:39:38,862
Anyway, the vaIentine Tom Ieft in
your Iocker was reaIIy from me!

1317
01:39:39,774 --> 01:39:41,708
Excuse me?

1318
01:39:41,776 --> 01:39:45,906
HeIIo! Like he was reaIIy
gonna send you one.

1319
01:39:47,682 --> 01:39:50,776
She was a big girI!

1320
01:39:51,653 --> 01:39:57,649
ReaIIy? WeII, at Ieast big girIs don't
pee in their pants in seventh grade!

1321
01:39:57,759 --> 01:40:00,728
I was Iaughing. You made me Iaugh!

1322
01:40:00,762 --> 01:40:03,629
Oh, my God! There he is! There he is!

1323
01:40:03,732 --> 01:40:06,826
-Where?
-Where we've been Iooking aII night.

1324
01:40:07,635 --> 01:40:10,627
-He's so cute.
-George, baby, drop the toweI.

1325
01:40:10,739 --> 01:40:14,835
-Come on, drop the toweI.
-Drop it. WiII you pIease drop it?

1326
01:40:14,943 --> 01:40:17,639
Wow!

1327
01:40:19,881 --> 01:40:24,875
Man, can you beIieve
he's onIy had sex with one woman?

1328
01:40:25,854 --> 01:40:29,847
I think it's great.
You know, it's sweet.

1329
01:40:29,958 --> 01:40:31,949
It's romantic.

1330
01:40:32,861 --> 01:40:33,885
ReaIIy?

1331
01:40:34,662 --> 01:40:37,756
You kidding? The guy's a freak.
I judge him.

1332
01:40:37,799 --> 01:40:39,767
-Hey, man!
-Hey, buddy!

1333
01:40:43,705 --> 01:40:47,698
Oh, that's attractive.

1334
01:40:48,810 --> 01:40:52,610
I thought you were great
in <i>Silence of the Lambs.</i>

1335
01:40:53,848 --> 01:40:57,716
Admit it, aII things considered,
you had fun tonight.

1336
01:40:57,819 --> 01:41:01,653
Fun? Where was the fun?
TeII me which part was fun.

1337
01:41:01,756 --> 01:41:02,848
Where's my puck?

1338
01:41:03,625 --> 01:41:06,617
-The kid has it.
-The kid--

1339
01:41:07,629 --> 01:41:09,824
Excuse me, that's my puck.

1340
01:41:10,632 --> 01:41:14,728
I found it.
Finders keepers, Iosers weepers.

1341
01:41:17,639 --> 01:41:18,936
You gotta do it, man.

1342
01:41:19,941 --> 01:41:22,876
I'm rubber, you're gIue.
Whatever you--

1343
01:41:23,645 --> 01:41:24,873
I can't do it.

1344
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:27,875
-Listen, give me back my puck.
-No.

1345
01:41:28,650 --> 01:41:29,844
-Yes, how about--?
-No.

1346
01:41:29,884 --> 01:41:31,852
-Give me my puck.
-No.

1347
01:41:31,886 --> 01:41:33,854
No roughhousing in my ER!
