Chandler: Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?

4
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:27,385
Shelley: Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you.

5
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,811
Chandler: Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...

6
00:00:29,811 --> 00:00:31,261
Shelley: Do you want a date Saturday?

7
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,882

13
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:03,255
Rachel: Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...

14
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:09,360
Chandler: You did?

15
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,396
Rachel: Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.

16
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:11,363
Chandler: Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?

17
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:14,395
Monica: I did. LAUGH

21
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:44,490
Chandler: You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't? LAUGH

22
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:48,457
Ross: No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...

23
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,361
Chandler: Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?

24
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,937

the fact that once you decide, it's like

Mrs. Geller: It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart.  Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream.

174
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:50,279
Joey: What?

175
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:54,284

00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,422
Joey: No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.

179

Mrs. Geller:  Your grandmother would have hated this.

213
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:47,247
Monica: Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.

214
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,216
Mrs. Geller: No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'.

215
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:59,229
Monica: That sounds like Nana. LAUGH

216
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:15,278

217
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,347
Monica: ...I can imagine.

218
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:24,388
Mrs. Geller: I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is.

219
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:29,259
Monica: That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?

220
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:34,458
Mrs. Geller: Tell her what?

221
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:46,410
Monica: How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.

222
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,473
Monica: Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?

223
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:53,478
Mrs. Geller: ...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along.

224
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:04,426
Monica: Huh.

225
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:10,258
Mrs. Geller: More wine, dear?

226
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,261
Monica: Oh, I think so.

227
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:26,274
Mrs. Geller:  Those earrings look really lovely on you.

228
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,386
Oh, look. My first grade picture.

Rachel: Aww, look at the little thing.

236
00:21:59,847 --> 00:22:06,451
Ross: Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?

237
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:10,421
Chandler: Who are those people?

238
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:15,230
Ross: Got me.

239
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,269
Monica: Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.  'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.

240
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:28,472
Rachel: Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?

241
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:40,382
Monica: Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?

Chandler: So how's it going there in Financial Services?

248
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,224
Lowell: It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?

249
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,231
Lowell: I know. That's what I told her.

250
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:27,261
Chandler: Really.

251
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:32,367

Chandler: So- you can tell?

253
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:44,884
Lowell: Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar.

254
00:23:44,884 --> 00:23:46,380
Chandler: So you don't think I have a, a quality?

255
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:58,368
Lowell: Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is. LAUGH
