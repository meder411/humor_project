JOEY: This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?

PHOEBE: Well, I mean, I'm not _married_ married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card.

29
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,439
We told each other everything.

30
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:35,003
MONICA: I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything.

31
00:02:35,003 --> 00:02:42,790
PHOEBE: I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve.

32
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,287
who was gay. What were you thinking?

33
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:48,366
MONICA: Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?

34
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,497
ROSS: You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental.

35
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:56,367
PHOEBE: OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend.

36
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,410
I saw you eat a cheeseburger.

37
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,307
ALL: Huuh.

38
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,241
MONICA: Well, didn't you?

39
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,252
PHOEBE: I might have.

40
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,818
MONICA: I can't believe you didn't tell me.

41
00:03:10,818 --> 00:03:12,314
PHOEBE: Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything.

42
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,827

44
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,259
PHOEBE: Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace.

45
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,336
Wait. Who told you?

46
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,375
You are dead meat.

47
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,338
MONICA: Wait a minute, who told you?  You are dead meat.

48
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,351
CHANDLER: I didn't know it was a big secret.

49
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:42,251
MONICA: Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple.

50
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,448
You have a third nipple?

51
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,361
PHOEBE: You have a third nipple?

52
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,298
CHANDLER: You bitch.

53
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,458
ROSS: Whip it out, whip it out.

54
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:02,240
CHANDLER: C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless.

55
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,435
RACHEL: Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?

56
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,347
JOEY: I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.

57
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:15,443
ROSS: Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?

58
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:19,248
JOEY: I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again.

59
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,258
ALL: Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin.

60
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:27,432
ALL: Huuh.

61
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,247
Oh, my God.

62
00:04:30,247 --> 00:04:31,259
CHANDLER: If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me.

63
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,337
ROSS: You were in a porno?

64
00:04:34,337 --> 00:04:36,436
But I couldn't go through with it.

65
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,359
I was the guy who fixes

66
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:41,764
the copier but can't because there's people

67
00:04:41,764 --> 00:04:43,248
having sex on it.

68
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,443
JOEY: Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it.

69
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,282
MONICA: That is wild.

70
00:04:48,282 --> 00:04:49,277
ROSS:  So what's it shaped like?

71
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,482
PHOEBE: Yeah, is there a hair on it?

72
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:02,291


73
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:08,431
ROSS: So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?

74
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:13,438
CHANDLER: Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.

75
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,726
You get the best huts,

76
00:05:15,726 --> 00:05:17,239
and women dance naked.

77
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:21,442
JULIE: You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you.

78
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:27,223
CHANDLER: Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?

79
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:32,330
ROSS: You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?

80
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,445
Does she put an outfit on at night

81
00:05:34,445 --> 00:05:36,458
and go out and fight crime?

82
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:41,920
RACHEL:  Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special.

83
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,467
You'll have to get over it.

84
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:55,344
MONICA: Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it.

85
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,287
ALL: Woah.

86
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:01,282
JOEY: Foxy lady.

87
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:07,232
JULIE: Where you goin'?

88
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,851
PHOEBE: Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades.

89
00:06:09,851 --> 00:06:17,231
JOEY: The Ice Capades?

90
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:22,311
CHANDLER: No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny.

91
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:29,416
MONICA: I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again.

92
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,838
The reason I'm dressed like this

93
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:36,421
is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.

94
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,356
PHOEBE: OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.

95
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:43,266
Chandler, would you fill me up here?

96
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:53,444
ROSS:  Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?

97
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,278

00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,886
ROSS: OK sweetie, I'll see you later.

00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,274
RACHEL: Hey, c'mon, cut it out.

00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:23,241
ROSS: Hey?

103
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,356
RACHEL: What?

104
00:07:25,356 --> 00:07:26,402
ROSS: Can I ask you somethin'?

105
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,946
ROSS: Naa.

00:07:31,946 --> 00:07:43,260
RACHEL: What? C'mon, talk to me.

00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:49,325
ROSS: OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?

108
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,468
RACHEL: Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?

109
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:03,362
ROSS: Technically, huh, no.

110
00:08:03,362 --> 00:08:05,410
makes it feel like school?

111
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:13,241
RACHEL: Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?

112
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:15,192
Lots of other stuff like--

113
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,489
ROSS: No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . .

114
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:29,431
RACHEL: No, no no no, don't need to know the details.

115
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,856
So now I've got myself

116
00:08:31,856 --> 00:08:33,403
all psyched out.

117
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:39,315
It's become, like, this...this thing!

118
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,218
You must just think I'm weird.

119
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:49,453
ROSS: It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird.

120
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,326
In fact, you know what I think?

121
00:08:51,326 --> 00:08:52,423
RACHEL: No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?

ROSS: Sexy?

want to have sex.

126
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,677
RACHEL: Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.

127
00:09:10,677 --> 00:09:13,174
ROSS: What?

128
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,716
You'd wait?

129
00:09:15,716 --> 00:09:22,385
ROSS: You'd wait?

130
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,386
RACHEL: Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more.

133
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,401
That just means it's working.

134
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,304
RACHEL: Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working.

135
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,314

136
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,267

161
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,375
ROSS: Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey.

162
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,309
RACHEL: What did, what did he say?

163
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,776
I thought about what you said

164
00:11:55,776 --> 00:11:57,272
and he said.

165
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,812
And his way,

166
00:11:58,812 --> 00:12:00,308
I get to have sex tonight, so....

167
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:13,355


168
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,259
CHANDLER: What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie.

169
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:23,366
ROSS: Pop it in.

170
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:29,280
JOEY: I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people. 

171
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,441
RACHEL: Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see.

172
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:41,406
ROSS: What's wrong with people having sex?

173
00:12:41,406 --> 00:12:43,454
to women and females....

174
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:46,977
And the lighting's

175
00:12:46,977 --> 00:12:48,490
always unflattering.

176
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:52,950
Monica, help me out here.

177
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,497
RACHEL: Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here.

178
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:05,439
MONICA: Hell, I wanna see Joey.

179
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,514
Oh. Never mind.

180
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,448
JULIE: So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind.

181
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,223
CHANDLER: OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen.

182
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:19,322
MONICA: All I say is, she better get the job.

183
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:27,319
ROSS: Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.

184
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:29,367
I'm thinking, ''What do I do?''

185
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:33,240
So I just watch them have sex.

186
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,247
Wait. Here's my line.

187
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,814
You know, that's bad

188
00:13:39,814 --> 00:13:41,344

189
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,481
JOEY: Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line,  _you know that's bad fo r the paper tray_.

190
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:48,487
CHANDLER: Nice work my friend.

191
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:51,926
There I am. There I am.

192
00:13:51,926 --> 00:13:53,490
There I am....

193
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,736
So, what's up?

194
00:14:02,736 --> 00:14:04,232


195
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,308
PHOEBE: So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday.

196
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:17,450
DUNCAN: Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce.

197
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,225
PHOEBE: Ohh. . .K. How come?

198
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,316
DUNCAN: Umm, actually, I'm getting married again.

199
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:28,426
PHOEBE: What?

200
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,371
I don't understand.

201
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:36,271
DUNCAN: Yeah, I know, I.

202
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,907
You're so smart and funny and you

203
00:14:38,907 --> 00:14:41,472
throw great Academy Award parties.

204
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:48,352
PHOEBE: I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties.

205
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,447
DUNCAN: I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.

206
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:56,487
PHOEBE: So how long have you known?

207
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,229
I was supposed to be something else.

208
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,364
I'm an ice dancer, all my friends

209
00:15:02,364 --> 00:15:04,429
are gay. I was trying to fit in.

210
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,437
DUNCAN: Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in.

211
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,439
PHOEBE: And um, and there's actually a, a woman?

212
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:19,307
DUNCAN: Her name's Debra.

213
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:29,777
PHOEBE: Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?

214
00:15:29,777 --> 00:15:33,423
go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman.

215
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,348
I told myself it was the liquor,

216
00:15:36,348 --> 00:15:38,430
and people experiment in college.

217
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,328
DUNCAN: Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college.

218
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:45,331
PHOEBE: Sure.

219
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:53,346
DUNCAN: But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way.

220
00:15:53,346 --> 00:15:55,342
and you think you know him.

221
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:56,871
And then one day he says,

222
00:15:56,871 --> 00:15:58,355
''Oh, I'm not gay!''

223
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,420
PHOEBE: I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'

224
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:11,301
DUNCAN: I'm, I'm still me.

225
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,333


226
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,236
MONICA: You know, it still smells like monkey in there.

227
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,410
JULIE: That saves us a conversation.

228
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:28,243
CHANDLER: Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped.

229
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,221
JOEY: Me too, we should get goin'.

230
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,417
Come on, it's only 1 1 :30.

231
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:37,223
Let's just talk. We never just

232
00:16:37,223 --> 00:16:39,219
hang out and talk anymore.

233
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,458
RACHEL: No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore.

234
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,269
MONICA: Rachel, that's all we do.

235
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,238
RACHEL: Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?

236
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:55,470
JULIE: What about Julie?

237
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,728
I mean, who is Julie?

238
00:16:58,728 --> 00:17:01,208
What do you like? What don't you like?

239
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,379
We want to know everything.

240
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,413
RACHEL: Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything.

241
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,383
So?

242
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,390
JULIE: Well, that could take a while.

243
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,264
RACHEL: So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?

244
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,394
JOEY: I got time.

245
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,397
That's fine.

246
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:27,405
MONICA: Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go?  That's fine.

247
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,211
RACHEL: OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?

248
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,253


249
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:43,285
PHOEBE: So, um, have you told your parents?

250
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:49,232
DUNCAN: No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . .

251
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,802
If you had figured this out sooner,

252
00:17:51,802 --> 00:17:55,823
and I had been around do you think

253
00:17:55,823 --> 00:17:57,307
I would have been the one...?

254
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,267
No. Don't tell me.

255
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,876
I don't think either answer

256
00:18:02,876 --> 00:18:05,373
would make me feel better. Here.

257
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,480
PHOEBE:  Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't th ink either answer would make me feel better.

258
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:29,204
DUNCAN: I love you Phoebe. 

259
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:37,444


260
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,248
JULIE: And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb.

261
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:43,219
RAHCEL: Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?

262
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,317
JULIE: No Cobb, as in cobb salad.

263
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,224
RACHEL: Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?

264
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,269
RACHEL: What?

265
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:00,405
JOEY: Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?

266
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:07,304
ROSS: Goodnight.

267
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,177
RACHEL: So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . .

268
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,309
ROSS: Oh, no no, I am.

269
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,416

270
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,385
ROSS: Um, no, I uh, I have done it before.

271
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,422
Will you talk about it beforehand?

272
00:19:23,422 --> 00:19:25,418
Will you just pounce?

273
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:32,295
RACHEL: Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?

274
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,339
ROSS: I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens.

275
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,199
RAHCEL: OK, gook luck.

276
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:44,711
ROSS: Wha, uhh, what?

277
00:19:44,711 --> 00:19:49,287
the first time doesn't go well well, then, that's pretty darn

278
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:51,255
hard to recover from.

279
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,316
RACHEL: Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.

280
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,229
ROSS: OK, now I'm nervous.

281
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:08,305
RACHEL: Maybe you should put it off.

282
00:20:08,305 --> 00:20:10,239
so unbelievably miserable.

283
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:13,277
And now I'm actually happy.

284
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,272
You know, I mean really happy.

285
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:19,383
I just don't wanna....

286
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,447
I don't wanna mess it up, you know?

287
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:30,454
ROSS: No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know.

288
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,263
RACHEL: I know, yeah, sorry.

289
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,491
Right.

290
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:42,001
ROSS: What, it's not your fault.

291
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:44,498
with that whole ''spontaneous'' thing.

292
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,873
Women really like that.

293
00:20:46,873 --> 00:20:48,369
RACHEL: Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that.

294
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:54,512
ROSS: Really?

295
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,918
I don't know, catch me off guard

296
00:20:56,918 --> 00:21:00,515
with a really good kiss.

297
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:07,421
Really sort of soft at first.

298
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,930
And then maybe brush

299
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,427
the hair away from my face.

300
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:19,910
And then look far into my eyes in a way that lets me

301
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:24,440
know something...amazing is about to happen.

302
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:38,378
ROSS:  Uh-huh.

303
00:21:38,378 --> 00:21:40,295
right against you.

304
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:51,501
And it would get kind of...sweaty...and blurry.

305
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,277
And then it's just happening.

306
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,348
RACHEL: And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening.

307
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,229
ROSS: Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight. 

308
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,277


309
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:34,344
ROSS: Good morning.

310
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,252
OLD WOMAN: Well, somebody got some last night. LAUGH
