1
00:00:01,421 --> 00:00:04,321
Phoebe: Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?

2
00:00:04,424 --> 00:00:08,190
Phoebe: Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.

3
00:00:09,295 --> 00:00:17,292
Monica: Oh my God.  Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression. LAUGH

4
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,338
Phoebe: Where?  Ooh, come to Momma. LAUGH

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,400
Monica: He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.

6
00:00:23,443 --> 00:00:24,825
Guy: Nice hat.

7
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,207
Monica and Phoebe:  Thanks.

8
00:00:26,412 --> 00:00:27,862
Phoebe: We should do something. Whistle.

9
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,312
Monica: We are not going to whistle.

10
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:30,338
Phoebe: Come on, do it.

11
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,475
Phoebe: Do it do it do it!

12
00:00:38,324 --> 00:00:40,417
Phoebe: I can't believe you did that! LAUGH

13
00:01:28,341 --> 00:01:29,774
It's all my fault.

14
00:01:29,774 --> 00:01:31,207
No, it's mine.

15
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:38,441
Monica: Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'? LAUGH

16
00:01:39,419 --> 00:01:50,217
Phoebe: I just wish there was something we could do.  Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!

17
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:51,353
Monica: Phoebe, what are you doing?

18
00:01:51,464 --> 00:01:53,432
Phoebe: Maybe nobody's tried this. LAUGH

19
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,301
Monica: I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.

20
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:01,364
calling him John Doe.

21
00:02:01,474 --> 00:02:03,391
It's so sad. It's like he's a deer,

22
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,308
a female deer.

23
00:02:06,212 --> 00:02:08,271
Oh, I was gonna stop. LAUGH

24
00:02:10,183 --> 00:02:14,180
Monica: I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.

25
00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:17,381
Phoebe: Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.

26
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:24,226
Monica: Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance! LAUGH

27
00:02:25,198 --> 00:02:34,329
Phoebe: Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked. LAUGH

28
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,405
Monica: I wish all guys could be like him.

29
00:02:41,314 --> 00:02:42,338
Phoebe: I know.

30
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,354
You don't even know this guy.

31
00:02:49,455 --> 00:02:53,323
Chandler: Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?

32
00:02:54,327 --> 00:02:55,419
Monica: He doesn't have anyone.

33
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:58,224
Phoebe: Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.

34
00:02:58,431 --> 00:03:03,265
Joey: I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo. LAUGH

35
00:03:03,369 --> 00:03:05,200
Rachel: Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up! 

36
00:03:05,271 --> 00:03:12,267
Jay Leno:  Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one.

37
00:03:12,378 --> 00:03:16,212
Chandler: Y'know, we don't have to watch this. _Weekend At Bernie's_ is on _Showtime_, _HBO_, and _Cinemax_.

38
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:17,271
Rachel: No way, forget it. LAUGH

39
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,367
Joey: C'mon, she's your mom!

40
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:25,289
Chandler: Exactly. _Weekend At Bernie's_! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No? LAUGH

41
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:32,390
Rachel: Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!

42
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:40,201
Chandler: Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.' LAUGH

43
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:42,433
I remember page 79.

44
00:03:43,242 --> 00:03:45,290
The thing after the opera

45
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,338
with the girl with the trick hip?

46
00:03:50,216 --> 00:03:52,240
Ross: C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast. LAUGH

47
00:03:52,351 --> 00:03:54,319
Chandler: You can say that because she's not your mom.

48
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,444
Ross: Oh, please...

49
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:57,517
Rachel: Oh, hi sweetie. 

50
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,359
Ross: When did Rigatoni get back from Rome? LAUGH

51
00:04:04,163 --> 00:04:04,709
Monica: Last night.

52
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:05,255
Really?

53
00:04:05,364 --> 00:04:12,259
Ross: Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew. LAUGH

54
00:04:13,406 --> 00:04:15,169
Phoebe: Hey hey hey! She's on!

55
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:19,371
Paolo: Ah! Nora Bing!

56
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,376
Jay Leno:  ...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about? LAUGH

57
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:27,379
Phoebe: Your mom was arrested?

58
00:04:27,486 --> 00:04:29,420
Chandler: Shhh, busy beaming with pride.

59
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:36,418
Mrs. Bing:  ...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man... LAUGH

60
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:39,389
Chandler: Now why would she say that's embarrassing? LAUGH

61
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,425
Mrs. Bing:  ...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.

62
00:04:44,237 --> 00:04:46,228
Chandler: THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!

63
00:04:50,309 --> 00:04:54,302
Needless to say, he got a huge tip.

64
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,410
Oh, God, I love her!

65
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:01,181
I think I'm having a stroke.

66
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:05,189
Jay Leno:  Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?

67
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:11,454
Mrs. Bing:  Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love...

68
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:17,301
Chandler: This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone. LAUGH

69
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:23,823
Jay Leno:  Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad...

70
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:28,313
Mrs. Bing:  Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.

71
00:05:34,387 --> 00:05:36,480
Chandler: ...And then he burst into flames. LAUGH

72
00:05:45,398 --> 00:05:58,233
Monica: Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports. LAUGH

73
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:27,396
Phoebe: What about Glen? He could be a Glen. LAUGH

74
00:06:28,174 --> 00:06:29,402
Monica: Nah... not-not special enough.

75
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:32,277
Phoebe: Ooh! How about Agamemnon?

76
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:35,174
Monica: Waaay too special.

77
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:45,282
Mrs. Bing: I am famished. What do I want... 

78
00:06:45,391 --> 00:06:48,417
Chandler: Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.

79
00:06:49,228 --> 00:06:52,196
Mrs. Bing: Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?

80
00:06:52,231 --> 00:06:54,425
Chandler: Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.

81
00:06:57,403 --> 00:07:01,373
Ross:  What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.

82
00:07:02,274 --> 00:07:05,334
Mrs. Bing: Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug.  Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.

83
00:07:06,178 --> 00:07:07,776
I heard about the divorce.

84
00:07:07,776 --> 00:07:09,374
Lesbian, huh?

85
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,647
Well, you know what they say:

86
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:16,144
Be careful what you wish for.

87
00:07:18,257 --> 00:07:19,724
Mrs. Bing: Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug.  Well, I think we're ready for some tequila.

88
00:07:19,724 --> 00:07:21,191
Chandler: I know I am.

89
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,255
Mrs. Bing: Who's doing shots?

90
00:07:22,255 --> 00:07:23,250
Monica: Yeah.

91
00:07:23,295 --> 00:07:24,353
Mrs. Bing: There y'go. Ross?

92
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:27,356
Ross: Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.

93
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:33,270
Rachel: Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.

94
00:07:35,374 --> 00:07:37,308
Ross: ...But a man can change. 

95
00:07:43,282 --> 00:07:45,409
Ross: Anyone want me to appraise anything?

96
00:07:56,395 --> 00:07:59,330
Well, I'm gonna go to tinker-town.

97
00:07:59,398 --> 00:08:07,127
Rachel: Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.

98
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:18,180
Mrs. Bing: Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book.

99
00:08:19,285 --> 00:08:22,152
Chandler: Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.

100
00:08:25,157 --> 00:08:28,149
Mrs. Bing: Yeah, any messages for room 226?

101
00:08:29,295 --> 00:08:30,825
Mrs. Bing: You okay there, slugger?

102
00:08:30,825 --> 00:08:32,355
Ross: Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. 

103
00:08:45,277 --> 00:08:47,177
Mrs. Bing: What is with you tonight?

104
00:08:47,213 --> 00:08:49,408
Ross: Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.

105
00:08:50,382 --> 00:08:52,179
Okay, thank you.

106
00:08:55,221 --> 00:08:57,451
Mrs. Bing:  It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it.

107
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,315
Ross: No. It's the one he's licking.

108
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,328
Mrs. Bing: She's supposed to be with you.

109
00:09:04,263 --> 00:09:05,321
Ross: You're good.

110
00:09:06,332 --> 00:09:11,234
Mrs. Bing: Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?

111
00:09:11,437 --> 00:09:14,371
Ross: The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?

112
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:34,250
Mrs. Bing: No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off.

113
00:09:35,361 --> 00:09:36,385
Ross: When?

114
00:09:39,164 --> 00:09:43,361
Mrs. Bing: He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.

115
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:46,295
Ross: The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?

116
00:09:47,273 --> 00:09:48,365
Mrs. Bing: No, it's you!

117
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:49,720
Ross: Please.

118
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,174
Mrs. Bing: No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy...

119
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:54,329
Ross: Right.

120
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:55,279
Yes, you are.

121
00:09:55,381 --> 00:09:57,298
The fact that you don't think you are

122
00:09:57,298 --> 00:09:59,215
makes you sexier.

123
00:09:59,285 --> 00:10:01,281
Come on, kiddo.

124
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:03,277
Mrs. Bing: You are gonna be fine, believe me.

125
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,505
Joey: Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.

126
00:10:34,253 --> 00:10:35,242
Ross: Hey, is Chandler here?

127
00:10:35,454 --> 00:10:37,217
Wait. Come here.

128
00:10:38,424 --> 00:10:44,262
Ross: Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell...  Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?

129
00:10:44,363 --> 00:10:46,411
We don't need to tell Chandler.

130
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:48,459
Joey: Right. No big deal.

131
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:50,462
Right. No big deal.

132
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:57,331
Joey: In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!

133
00:10:57,443 --> 00:10:58,876
Ross: What code?

134
00:10:58,876 --> 00:11:06,477
Joey: You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!

135
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:11,389
Chandler: What are you guys doing out here?

136
00:11:12,191 --> 00:11:20,222
Ross: Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.

137
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:23,498
Joey: Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.

138
00:11:24,236 --> 00:11:29,298
Ross: No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.

139
00:11:30,342 --> 00:11:33,334
Joey: Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.

140
00:11:35,447 --> 00:11:38,415
Chandler: Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. 

141
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,251
Ross: Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.

142
00:11:43,355 --> 00:11:44,401
Joey: Ross, how could you let this happen?

143
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:50,227
Ross: I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...

144
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:52,354
Joey: You don't think my mom's sexy?

145
00:11:53,465 --> 00:11:56,332
Ross: Well... not in the same way...

146
00:11:56,435 --> 00:12:05,268
Joey: I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?

147
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,271
Ross: Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...

148
00:12:12,384 --> 00:12:14,181
Rachel: What're you guys doing out here?

149
00:12:15,387 --> 00:12:17,287
Ross: Well, not playing raquetball!

150
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:21,387
Joey: He forgot to leave his grip size!

151
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:23,383
Ross: He didn't get the goggles!

152
00:12:25,431 --> 00:12:28,229
Rachel: Well,sounds like you two have issues.

153
00:12:31,303 --> 00:12:32,327
Rachel: Goodbye, baby.

154
00:12:34,506 --> 00:12:37,236
Ross: Do they wait for me to do this?

155
00:12:43,315 --> 00:12:44,811
Joey: So are you gonna tell him?

156
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:46,307
Ross: Why would I tell him?

157
00:12:46,418 --> 00:12:49,216
Joey: How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.

158
00:12:50,322 --> 00:12:52,415
Monica:  What are you guys doing here?

159
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:55,418
Joey: Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!

160
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,191
Monica: ...What did I ask?

161
00:13:17,382 --> 00:13:19,213
Monica: What are you doing here?

162
00:13:19,284 --> 00:13:26,189
Phoebe: Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?

163
00:13:27,226 --> 00:13:41,201
Monica: I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?

164
00:13:41,306 --> 00:13:50,211
Phoebe: No.  No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?

165
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,214
Monica: How would I know? I-I wasn't here.

166
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:57,413
Phoebe: Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?! 

167
00:14:01,393 --> 00:14:02,360
Chandler: Oh my God.

168
00:14:03,162 --> 00:14:05,356
Ross: You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.

169
00:14:06,165 --> 00:14:10,164
Chandler: I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?

170
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:23,405
Ross: Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh...  I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.

171
00:14:24,283 --> 00:14:25,272
Chandler: What?

172
00:14:25,484 --> 00:14:39,914
Ross: I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-

173
00:14:39,914 --> 00:14:41,398
Chandler:  You knew about this?

174
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:44,396
Joey: Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.

175
00:14:45,337 --> 00:14:47,430
Chandler: I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!

176
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,436
Joey: Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.

177
00:14:52,244 --> 00:14:53,336
Ross: Thanks, man, big help.

178
00:14:54,313 --> 00:14:56,304
Chandler:  I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?

179
00:14:56,415 --> 00:14:58,406
Ross: I wasn't- I mean, I-

180
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:02,180
Chandler: Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.

181
00:15:02,254 --> 00:15:03,266
Ross: I know-

182
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:04,278
Chandler: I can't believe you did this. 

183
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:05,771
Me neither.

184
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,153
Chandler: I'm still mad at you for not telling me.

185
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:08,709
Joey: What are you mad at me for?!

186
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,159
Chandler: You gotta let me slam the door! 

187
00:15:11,263 --> 00:15:15,255
Joey:  See what happens when you break the code?

188
00:15:28,413 --> 00:15:31,405
Monica:  'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.

189
00:15:32,184 --> 00:15:40,381
Rachel: Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?

190
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:48,193
Monica:  Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.

191
00:15:53,338 --> 00:15:54,771
Phoebe: Going to the hospital tonight?

192
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:56,204
Monica: No, you?

193
00:15:56,408 --> 00:15:57,432
Phoebe: No, you?

194
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:02,270
Monica: You just asked me.

195
00:16:02,347 --> 00:16:08,378
Phoebe: Okay, maybe it was a trick question.  Um, Rachel can we do this now?

196
00:16:10,355 --> 00:16:12,346
Rachel: Okay.  I am so hot!

197
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:20,288
Joey:  Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.

198
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:24,818
Ross: I cannot believe we're having this conversation.

199
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,469
Joey: C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.

200
00:16:28,373 --> 00:16:33,275
Rachel:  Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.

201
00:16:34,313 --> 00:16:45,321
Phoebe: Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me.  _

202
00:16:50,429 --> 00:17:09,144
> You don't have to be awake to be my man,   As long as you have brainwaves I'll be there to hold your hand.   Though we just met the other day,   There's something I have got to say...

203
00:17:10,182 --> 00:17:11,666
Thank you very much.

204
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,150
I'm gonna take a short break.

205
00:17:15,354 --> 00:17:19,154
Rachel:  Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!

206
00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:21,692
Chandler: What was that?

207
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:23,159
Ross: Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...

208
00:17:23,228 --> 00:17:27,288
Chandler: Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser? 

209
00:17:32,237 --> 00:17:33,363
''Mother-kisser.''

210
00:17:35,273 --> 00:17:36,297
Joey:  I'll shut up.

211
00:17:36,408 --> 00:17:43,910
Ross: Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.

212
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:48,411
Chandler: Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.

213
00:17:49,187 --> 00:17:52,213
Ross: Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?

214
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:57,191
Chandler: Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!

215
00:18:00,432 --> 00:18:03,128
Ross:  We're rehearsing a Greek play.

216
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:06,203
Chandler: That's very funny. We done now?

217
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:09,331
Ross: No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?

218
00:18:10,142 --> 00:18:16,271
Chandler: That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.

219
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:19,145
Ross: Okay, 'you' can't, or  Still doing the play. Aaah!

220
00:18:20,285 --> 00:18:21,377
Okay, that's my finger.

221
00:18:22,187 --> 00:18:24,348
Okay, that's my knee.

222
00:18:25,157 --> 00:18:26,249
Still doing the play.

223
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:36,293
Phoebe: Alright, whadyou do with him?

224
00:18:40,405 --> 00:18:41,389
Monica: Oh! You're awake!

225
00:18:41,389 --> 00:18:44,403
Phoebe: Look at you! How, how do you feel?

226
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,201
Coma Guy: Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.

227
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:49,270
Monica: You look good!

228
00:18:49,314 --> 00:18:53,377
Coma Guy: I feel good! ...Who are you?

229
00:18:53,418 --> 00:18:54,368
Monica: Oh, sorry.

230
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:55,318
Phoebe: I'm Phoebe Buffay.

231
00:18:55,387 --> 00:18:58,219
Monica: I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.

232
00:18:58,323 --> 00:18:59,290
Phoebe: Well, we both have.

233
00:18:59,424 --> 00:19:00,874
Coma Guy: So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?

234
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:02,324
Phoebe: Well, actually it's just from me.

235
00:19:03,128 --> 00:19:04,225
Monica: I got you the foot massager.

236
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:05,322
Phoebe: You know who shaved you? That was me.

237
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,795
Monica: I read to you.

238
00:19:06,795 --> 00:19:08,160
Phoebe: I sang.  Hah!

239
00:19:10,235 --> 00:19:11,327
Coma Guy: Well,... thanks.

240
00:19:12,137 --> 00:19:13,183
Monica: Oh, my pleasure.

241
00:19:13,183 --> 00:19:14,229
Phoebe: You're welcome.

242
00:19:14,272 --> 00:19:17,241
Coma Guy: So. I guess I'll see you around.

243
00:19:18,343 --> 00:19:20,243
Phoebe: What, that's it?

244
00:19:21,146 --> 00:19:22,272
Monica: "See you around?"

245
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,876
Coma Guy: Well, what do you want me to say?

246
00:19:23,876 --> 00:19:33,254
Monica: Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, "That was nice?" Admit something to me? "I'll call you?"

247
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:35,839
Coma Guy: Alright, I'll call you.

248
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,386
Phoebe: I don't think you mean that.

249
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:58,178
Monica: This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and "See you around!" Let's go, Phoebe.

250
00:20:00,218 --> 00:20:05,481
Phoebe: Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.

251
00:20:16,301 --> 00:20:20,293
Mrs. Bing: Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?

252
00:20:20,338 --> 00:20:22,289
Autographed.

253
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:24,240
And give you a goodbye kiss.

254
00:20:24,342 --> 00:20:25,826
Here's the kiss,

255
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:27,310
here's the goodbye....

256
00:20:27,445 --> 00:20:29,845
Mrs. Bing: Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?

257
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:32,245
Chandler: No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.

258
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:36,217
Mrs. Bing: Alright, well, be good, I love you. 

259
00:20:39,257 --> 00:20:46,226
Chandler: You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.

260
00:20:52,337 --> 00:20:54,271
Mrs. Bing:  O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid.

261
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:55,351
Chandler: Really stupid.

262
00:20:55,351 --> 00:21:06,213
Mrs. Bing: Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?

263
00:21:06,318 --> 00:21:08,218
Really, really stupid.

264
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,413
Really, really stupid.

265
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,253
Mrs. Bing: Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?

266
00:21:13,253 --> 00:21:16,187
Chandler: Yeah. No. No...

267
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:24,325
Ross: Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.

268
00:21:26,304 --> 00:21:29,398
Joey: Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.

269
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:30,430
Ross: You're kidding.

270
00:21:31,243 --> 00:21:34,337
Joey: No, no. He said "When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"

271
00:21:34,412 --> 00:21:40,344
Joey: Then she came back with "The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?"

272
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:49,358
Ross: 'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"

273
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:52,979
Joey: That makes more sense.

274
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,429
You think?

275
00:21:56,268 --> 00:21:57,360
Ross: So, what's going on now?

276
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:02,172
Joey: I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! 

277
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,275
I don't hear anything. Wait.

278
00:22:05,377 --> 00:22:06,366
Ross: Whaddya see?

279
00:22:07,178 --> 00:22:18,287
Joey: Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!

280
00:22:20,425 --> 00:22:21,858
Mrs. Bing: You okay, kiddo?

281
00:22:21,858 --> 00:22:23,291
Chandler: Yeah, okay.

282
00:22:23,395 --> 00:22:25,295
Mrs. Bing: Alright. 

283
00:22:25,397 --> 00:22:27,228
Chandler: Nice save.

284
00:22:29,234 --> 00:22:30,263
Ross:  Mrs. Bing.

285
00:22:30,263 --> 00:22:31,292
Mrs. Bing: Mr. Geller.

286
00:22:40,312 --> 00:22:41,404
Ross: You mean that?

287
00:22:42,347 --> 00:22:48,309
Chandler: Yeah, why not.  So I told her.

288
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,387
Ross: Yeah? How'd it go?

289
00:22:49,387 --> 00:22:52,353
Chandler: Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.

290
00:22:53,425 --> 00:22:54,875
Ross: Well, howdya feel?

291
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:59,421
Chandler: Pretty good! I told her.

292
00:23:00,198 --> 00:23:09,397
Ross: Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh?  But.. we don't have to go down that road.

293
00:23:15,413 --> 00:23:27,280
Rachel: Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.

294
00:23:29,194 --> 00:23:30,491
She could have heaving beasts.

295
00:23:31,396 --> 00:23:34,388
Right, but in this case she doesn't.

296
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,289
Monica: What's a 'niffle'?

297
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:37,868
You can usually find them

298
00:23:37,868 --> 00:23:39,335
on the heaving beasts.

299
00:23:41,406 --> 00:23:43,431
Rachel: Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...

300
00:23:44,242 --> 00:23:52,404
Ross: Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!

301
00:23:53,351 --> 00:23:55,342
Rachel: Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!

302
00:23:56,254 --> 00:23:58,319
Wait, I just got to the part

303
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:00,384
about her ''public hair.'' LAUGH
