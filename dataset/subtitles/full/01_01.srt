1
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,485
Monica: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!

2
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,454
Joey: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him! LAUGH

3
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:09,459
Chandler: All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?

4
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,271
Phoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?

5
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,434
Phoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!

6
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:26,344
Monica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex. LAUGH

7
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:29,445
Chandler: Sounds like a date to me. LAUGH

8
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:37,354
Chandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.

9
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,364
All: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.

10
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:46,462
Chandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.

11
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:49,358
Joey: Instead of...? LAUGH

12
00:01:49,358 --> 00:01:50,308
Chandler: That's right.

13
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,274
Joey: Never had that dream.

14
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:59,581
Chandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.

15
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,414
Monica: And they weren't looking at you before?! LAUGH

16
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:15,389
Chandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me! LAUGH

17
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,271
Ross:  Hi. LAUGH

18
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,245
Joey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself. LAUGH

19
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,271
Monica: Are you okay, sweetie?

20
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:38,304
Ross: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...

21
00:02:38,304 --> 00:02:40,352
Chandler: Cookie? LAUGH

22
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,394
Monica:  Carol moved her stuff out today.

23
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,976
Monica:  Let me get you some coffee.

24
00:02:44,976 --> 00:02:46,489
Ross: Thanks.

25
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:57,858
Ross: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?

26
00:02:57,858 --> 00:03:00,241
Phoebe: Fine!  Be murky! LAUGH

27
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,330
Ross: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.

28
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,247
Monica: No you don't.

29
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,445
Ross: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!

30
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,416
Joey: And you never knew she was a lesbian... LAUGH

31
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:24,334
Ross: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know? LAUGH

32
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:32,268
Chandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud? LAUGH

33
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,282
Ross: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.

34
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:48,291
Monica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., "I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren." was what?  A wrong number? LAUGH

35
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,350
Ross: Sorry.

36
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:58,461
Joey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?

37
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:04,400
Joey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!

38
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:11,408
Ross: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again! LAUGH

39
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:19,419
Chandler: And I just want a million dollars! LAUGH

40
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,927
Monica: Rachel?!

41
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:33,237
Rachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!

42
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,307
Waitress: Can I get you some coffee?

43
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:46,340
Monica:  This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? LAUGH

44
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,476
Rachel: Hi, sure!

45
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:02,297
Monica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids? LAUGH

46
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:54,251
Rachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city. LAUGH

47
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,902
Monica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding. LAUGH

48
00:05:56,902 --> 00:05:59,450
Rachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...

49
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:21,202
Monica: Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.

50
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:24,314
Chandler:  Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!

51
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:30,353
Ross:  I'll have whatever Christine is having.

52
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:43,425
Rachel:  Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!

53
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:50,468
Phoebe:  If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.

54
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:55,345
Chandler:  Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.

55
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,281
Joey: I say push her down the stairs.

56
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,316
Phoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey:  Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!

57
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:30,339
Rachel: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!

58
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,413
Ross: You can see where he'd have trouble.

59
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:43,259
Rachel: Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.

60
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,425
Monica: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...

61
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:58,275
Rachel: Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!

62
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:11,188
Monica: Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...

63
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:23,429
Phoebe:  bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...

64
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,237
Rachel: I'm all better now.

65
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,402
Phoebe:  I helped!

66
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:39,412
Monica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing.

67
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:47,419
Joey:  And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.

68
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,260
Monica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!

69
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,423
Joey: What, like there's a rule or something?

70
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:03,434
Chandler: Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.

71
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,369
Paul:  It's, uh, it's Paul.

72
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:09,272
Monica: Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!

73
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,781
Joey: Who's Paul?

74
00:09:10,781 --> 00:09:12,180
Ross: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?

75
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:16,413
Monica: Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?

76
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,252
Ross: He finally asked you out?

77
00:09:18,252 --> 00:09:19,315
Monica: Yes!

78
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,225
Chandler: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.

79
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,842
Monica: Rach, wait, I can cancel...

80
00:09:23,842 --> 00:09:25,389
Rachel: Please, no, go, that'd be fine!

81
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,327
Monica:  Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?

82
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,337
Ross:  That'd be good...

83
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,403
Monica:  Really?

84
00:09:36,403 --> 00:09:38,399
Ross:  No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!

85
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:44,349
Phoebe: What does that mean?   Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? 

86
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:50,413
Monica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.

87
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,337
All: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!

88
00:09:54,337 --> 00:09:56,316
Chandler: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?

89
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,256
Monica: Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...

90
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,427
Ross: A wandering?

91
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:07,463
Monica: Change!  Okay, sit down.  Two seconds.

92
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:16,243
Phoebe: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.

93
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,352
Joey:  Hey, Paul!

94
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:30,261
Joey: Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.

95
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,457
Monica:  Shut up, Joey!

96
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,291
Ross: So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?

97
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:43,366
Rachel: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!

98
00:10:44,477 --> 00:11:06,262
Ross: Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.

99
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,459
Chandler:  Yes, and we're very excited about it.

100
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:13,366
Rachel: Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day.

101
00:11:13,366 --> 00:11:14,361
Ross: Okay, sure.

102
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,236
Joey: Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?

103
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:20,277
Phoebe: Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.

104
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:53,278
Phoebe:  La-la-la-la...ohhh!

105
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:17,464
Ross:  I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.

106
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,291
Joey: I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.

107
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,242
Chandler: It's a beautiful thing.

108
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,241
Joey:  What's this?

109
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,273
Chandler: I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.

110
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,447
Joey: Which goes where?

111
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:36,443
Chandler: I have no idea.

112
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:39,970
Joey: Done with the bookcase!

113
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,483
Chandler: All finished!

114
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:53,259
Ross:  This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.

115
00:12:56,408 --> 00:13:01,402
Joey: Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.

116
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:09,448
Joey: Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?

117
00:13:05,397 --> 00:13:07,445
the stereo, the good TV.

118
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,735
Ross: You guys.

119
00:13:11,735 --> 00:13:13,248
Joey: You got screwed.

120
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,424
Chandler: Oh my God!

121
00:13:15,424 --> 00:13:25,265
Paul: I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?

122
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:29,366
Monica: My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?

123
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:34,311
Paul: Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-

124
00:13:34,311 --> 00:13:35,243
Monica: -leg?

125
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:39,283
Paul:  That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch.

126
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:46,448
Monica: You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.

127
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,823
Paul: Ooh, steer clear of you.

128
00:13:48,823 --> 00:13:50,387
Monica: That's right.

129
00:13:51,297 --> 00:14:30,428
Rachel: Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- 

130
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:38,256
Ross: I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!

131
00:14:38,256 --> 00:14:41,271
Joey: Shut up!

132
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:48,282
Ross: That only took me an hour.

133
00:14:49,288 --> 00:15:13,336
Chandler: Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!

134
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:26,314
Ross: You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...

135
00:15:28,327 --> 00:16:01,291
Joey: What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!

136
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,810
Ross: I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.

137
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,193
Chandler: Stay out of my freezer!

138
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,295
Paul: Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...

139
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:18,301
Monica: What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?

140
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:23,312
Paul: No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation.

141
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:28,217
Monica: Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?

142
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:29,447
Paul: Isn't there?

143
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:37,252
Monica: Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?

144
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:49,339
Paul: Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform.  ...Sexually.

145
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:54,435
Monica:  Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...

146
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:02,216
Monica: I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?

147
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,817
Paul: Two years.

148
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:09,384
Monica: Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!

149
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:15,323
Paul: So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?

150
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:21,228
Monica: ...Yeah. Yeah, I do.

151
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:37,217
Priest on TV: We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi-Chachi-Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony.

152
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:44,353
Rachel: Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!

153
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:55,366
Ross:  Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?

154
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:07,217
Joey: Great story!  But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man, 

155
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:10,414
Chandler: Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.

156
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,388
Joey: Right.  Thanks.  It's June.  I'm outta here. 

157
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:26,236
Ross: Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? 

158
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:54,264
Rachel: Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.

159
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:55,412
Chandler: That is amazing.

160
00:18:55,412 --> 00:18:56,458
Joey: Congratulations.

161
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:00,465
Rachel: Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.

162
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:06,367
Chandler: If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.

163
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:17,481
Joey: Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something...  Although actually I'm really not that hungry...

164
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:22,318
Monica:  Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.

165
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,207
All: Morning. Good morning.

166
00:19:24,207 --> 00:19:25,219
Paul:  Morning.

167
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,200
Joey: Morning, Paul.

168
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,768
Rachel: Hello, Paul.

169
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:32,235
Chandler: Hi, Paul, is it?

170
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,778
Paul: Thank you!  Thank you so much!

171
00:19:40,778 --> 00:19:42,245
Monica: Stop!

172
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:49,412
Paul: No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in _Witness_.

173
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,520
Monica: We'll talk later.

174
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,528
Paul: Yeah. 

175
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:17,439
Joey: That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?

176
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,475
Monica: Shut up, and put my table back.

177
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:30,259
Chandler: All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...

178
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,459
Rachel: So, like, you guys all have jobs?

179
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:41,399
Monica: Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.

180
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,488
Joey: Yeah, I'm an actor.

181
00:20:45,488 --> 00:20:47,501
Rachel: Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?

182
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,372
Joey: I doubt it. Mostly regional work.

183
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:57,287
Monica: Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.

184
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,481
Joey: Look, it was a job all right?

185
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,416
Chandler: 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'

186
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,342
Joey: I will not take this abuse. 

187
00:21:06,342 --> 00:21:11,267
Chandler: You're right, I'm sorry.  "_Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..._"

188
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:20,234
Joey: You should both know, that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler? 

189
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:28,485
Monica: So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.

190
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:33,384
Rachel: I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.

191
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:42,984
Monica: I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?

192
00:21:42,984 --> 00:21:44,468
Rachel: Oh, yeah.

193
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:48,405
Monica: Well, it's like that. With feelings.

194
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,892
Rachel: Oh wow. Are you in trouble.

195
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,376
Monica: Big time!

196
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:56,307
Rachel: Want a wedding dress?   Hardly used.

197
00:21:56,381 --> 00:22:08,416
Monica: I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.

198
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,410
Rachel: Oh, look, wish me luck!

199
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,360
Monica: What for?

200
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:15,229
Rachel: I'm gonna go get one of those  job things.

201
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,390
Frannie: Hey, Monica!

202
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,394
Monica: Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?

203
00:22:29,394 --> 00:22:31,242
Frannie: You had sex, didn't you?

204
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,314
Monica: How do you do that?

205
00:22:34,314 --> 00:22:42,484
Frannie: Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex!  So? Who?

206
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,454
Monica: You know Paul?

207
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:48,357
Frannie: Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul.

208
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:53,367
Monica: You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?

209
00:22:53,472 --> 00:23:00,232
Frannie: Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.

210
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,215
Joey: Of course it was a line!

211
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:09,218
Monica: Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?

212
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:15,416
Ross: I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.

213
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,258
Monica: I hate men!  I hate men!

214
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,356
Phoebe: Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.

215
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:30,466
Monica: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?

216
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:34,336
Phoebe: All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. 

217
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,444
Monica: I just thought he was nice, y'know?

218
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:50,551
Joey:  I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!

219
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,333
Rachel: Guess what?

220
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,300
Ross: You got a job?

221
00:23:56,368 --> 00:24:02,821
Rachel: Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.

222
00:24:02,821 --> 00:24:04,436
Chandler: And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.

223
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:10,347
Rachel: You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!

224
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:13,407
Chandler: Oh, how well you know me...

225
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,413
Rachel: They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!

226
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,288
Monica: How'd you pay for them?

227
00:24:22,288 --> 00:24:23,317
Rachel: Uh, credit card.

228
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,363
Monica: And who pays for that?

229
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,366
Rachel: Um... my... father.

230
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:35,465
Rachel: Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.

231
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,334
Monica: C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.

232
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:42,278
Rachel: I know that. That's why I was getting married.

233
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:46,243
Phoebe: Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.

234
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:47,340
Rachel: Thank you.

235
00:24:47,385 --> 00:25:07,499
Phoebe: You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.

236
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:17,213
Ross: The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...

237
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:22,817
Monica: All right, you ready?

238
00:25:22,817 --> 00:25:29,238
Rachel: No.  No, no, I'm not ready!  How can I be ready?  "Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?"  Come on, I can't do this!

239
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:30,250
Monica: You can, I know you can!

240
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:31,841
Rachel: I don't think so.

241
00:25:31,841 --> 00:25:33,354
Ross: Come on, you made coffee!   You can do anything! 

242
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:39,226
Ross: C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...

243
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:49,542
Rachel: Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...

244
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:51,538
Monica:  Rachel!  That was a library card!

245
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:03,324
Chandler:  Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.

246
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:11,426
Monica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!

247
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,437
Monica: Well, that's it  You gonna crash on the couch?

248
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:25,210
Ross: No. No, I gotta go home sometime.

249
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,206
Monica: You be okay?

250
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:34,418
Rachel: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor.  What?

251
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:44,399
Monica: That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.

252
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:46,264
Ross and Rachel: Goodnight.

253
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,782
Rachel: No, you have it, really, I don't want it-

254
00:26:58,782 --> 00:27:01,216
Ross: Split it?

255
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:11,387
Ross: Okay.  You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.

256
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,290
Rachel: I knew.

257
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:21,331
Ross: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.

258
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,397
Rachel: I did.

259
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:39,513
Ross: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?

260
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:44,352
Rachel: Yeah, maybe...

261
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:54,261
Ross: Okay... okay, maybe I will...

262
00:27:58,376 --> 00:27:59,889
Rachel: Goodnight.

263
00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:01,402
Ross: Goodnight.

264
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:21,195
Monica: See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?

265
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:27,428
Ross: I just grabbed a spoon. 

266
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,225
Joey: I can't believe what I'm hearing here.

267
00:28:36,225 --> 00:28:38,238
Phoebe:  _I can't believe what I'm hearing here... _

268
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:39,328
Monica: What? I-I said you had a-

269
00:28:39,328 --> 00:28:40,340
Phoebe:  _What I said you had... _

270
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,818
Monica:  Would you stop?

271
00:28:42,818 --> 00:28:44,217
Phoebe: Oh, was I doing it again?

272
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:46,347
All: Yes!

273
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:51,326
Monica: I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.

274
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,392
Joey: Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.

275
00:28:53,392 --> 00:28:55,422
