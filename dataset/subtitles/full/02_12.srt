00:00:09,298 --> 00:00:12,290
COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER: Can't get the monkey off your back? Then put it in your mouth...

2
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:19,338
COMMERCIAL VOICEOVER: ...With MonkeyShine Beer. _

3
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:22,343
Get it, get it, monkey

4
00:00:24,413 --> 00:00:25,505
Monkey, monkey

5
00:00:25,614 --> 00:00:27,411
Monkeyshine Beer.

6
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,509
'Cause it's a jungle out there.

7
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:32,446
ROSS: That commercial always makes me so sad.

8
00:00:32,555 --> 00:00:38,359
JOEY: Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK. LAUGH

9
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:41,529
ROSS: I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.

10
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:50,564
PHOEBE: I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.   MONICA: And the fact that they're both monkeys.

11
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,474
ROSS: Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away. LAUGH

12
00:00:54,543 --> 00:01:02,510
RACHEL: Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.

13
00:01:05,354 --> 00:01:14,419
ROSS: Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it. LAUGH

14
00:01:14,497 --> 00:01:22,494
CHANDLER: Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem. LAUGH

15
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,446
JOEY: Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got.

16
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:15,285
CHANDLER: Rhythm? LAUGH

17
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:18,316
JOEY: No, my first fan mail.

18
00:02:20,396 --> 00:02:35,537
MONICA:  'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'

19
00:02:37,413 --> 00:02:40,405
RACHEL: Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married. LAUGH

20
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:49,019
MONICA: This wasn't addressed to _Days of Our Lives_, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building.

21
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:53,428
JOEY: Oh my god, I got my very own stalker. LAUGH

22
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:57,448
You're so lucky.

23
00:02:57,448 --> 00:02:59,365
I have to share with guys at work. LAUGH

24
00:03:00,502 --> 00:03:03,403
Remember we talked about ''good thing,

25
00:03:03,403 --> 00:03:06,304
bad thing''? This is a bad thing. LAUGH

26
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:08,271
ROSS: Hey guys.

27
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,266
ALL: Hey.

28
00:03:09,378 --> 00:03:10,504
PHOEBE: Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?

29
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,275
ROSS: Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.

30
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:25,519
CHANDLER: You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion. LAUGH

31
00:03:28,297 --> 00:03:30,491
RACHEL: Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again.

32
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:39,329
PHOEBE: Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now.

33
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:44,509
PHOEBE: I know, I know.  Hello. LAUGH

34
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:47,428
ROB: Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen.

35
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:48,508
PHOEBE: Hi Rob Dohnen.

36
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:53,316
ROB: I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great.

37
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:55,514
PHOEBE: Oh, wow.

38
00:03:55,557 --> 00:04:04,460
ROB: Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?

39
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:14,374
PHOEBE: Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them. LAUGH

40
00:04:16,378 --> 00:04:18,278
JOEY: Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?

41
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,371
CHANDLER: Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves. 

42
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:27,351
CHANDLER: Hello. LAUGH

43
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,380
ERICA: It's Erica.

44
00:04:28,524 --> 00:04:30,321
JOEY: Ah, the stalker.

45
00:04:30,426 --> 00:04:31,484
ERICA: Never mind, it's open.

46
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:40,490
CHANDLER:  Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon. LAUGH

47
00:04:42,304 --> 00:04:43,498
JOEY: Let's get out of here. LAUGH

48
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:48,533
CHANDLER: The one time they're not home.

49
00:04:50,412 --> 00:04:59,617
JOEY: OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met.   CHANDLER: That's how radio stars escape stalkers. LAUGH

50
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,450
JOEY: She's comin'. LAUGH

51
00:05:08,464 --> 00:05:10,261
ERICA: It's me. LAUGH

52
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:15,394
JOEY: Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?

53
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:17,363
CHANDLER: Wait, wait, wait. 

54
00:05:26,315 --> 00:05:27,373
JOEY: Erica. LAUGH

55
00:05:37,426 --> 00:05:43,525
LIPSON: Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question. LAUGH

56
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:50,495
ROSS: Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel.

57
00:05:51,407 --> 00:05:56,603
LIPSON: Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on.

58
00:05:58,514 --> 00:06:01,347
ROSS: Oh my God, what happened?

59
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:08,382
LIPSON: Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died.

60
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,386
ROSS: I can't believe this. LAUGH

61
00:06:12,494 --> 00:06:27,468
LIPSON: I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today. LAUGH

62
00:06:28,277 --> 00:06:29,392
ROSS: Well, ya know, someone should have called me.

63
00:06:29,392 --> 00:06:36,308
LIPSON: I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture.

64
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,316
ROSS: Zoo dollars?

65
00:06:39,421 --> 00:06:48,386
LIPSON: Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died. LAUGH

66
00:06:57,339 --> 00:06:58,431
PHOEBE: I know.

67
00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:04,376
MONICA: I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like. LAUGH

68
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:07,279
CHANDLER: Well, you remember Cathy Bates in _Misery_?

69
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:10,375
CHANDLER: Well, she looks the exact opposite of that. LAUGH

70
00:07:11,386 --> 00:07:13,354
RACHEL: And she's not crazy?

71
00:07:13,455 --> 00:07:20,350
CHANDLER: Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore.

72
00:07:20,462 --> 00:07:22,293
RACHEL: Oh my God. LAUGH

73
00:07:22,364 --> 00:07:26,300
MONICA: Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this.

74
00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:41,471
CHANDLER: Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac.

75
00:07:42,584 --> 00:07:44,313
ROB: You OK? LAUGH

76
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:49,481
PHOEBE: No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear.

77
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:54,284
ROB: That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired. LAUGH

78
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:14,281
PHOEBE: I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me? LAUGH

79
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,444
ROSS: I was thinkin' about it. LAUGH

80
00:08:17,386 --> 00:08:24,357
PHOEBE: OK.  OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe LAUGH

81
00:08:26,295 --> 00:08:27,791
Let's go find our seats.

82
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,287
Chandler?

83
00:08:29,364 --> 00:08:31,355
Hold on a second.

84
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:33,359
He thinks he can.

85
00:08:35,304 --> 00:08:37,295
He thinks he can. LAUGH

86
00:08:38,407 --> 00:08:40,398
Oh, what the hell?

87
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:42,409
He can. LAUGH

88
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:46,392
Hi, everybody. I'm Phoebe.

89
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,371
ALL: Hi Phoebe.

90
00:08:51,386 --> 00:09:18,472
PHOEBE: OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK.    _Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes,   she bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike.   But lately she hasn't been coming to dinner,   And last time you saw her she looked so much thinner.   Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru,   but the truth is she died and some day you will too.   La-la-la la la-la-la la la-la-la la..._ LAUGH

91
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:32,255
I'll have the grilled salmon. LAUGH

92
00:09:32,361 --> 00:09:35,455
And the doctor will have the risotto. LAUGH

93
00:09:36,498 --> 00:09:38,881
ERICA: Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?

94
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:43,463
JOEY: Yeah it is. . . what? LAUGH

95
00:09:44,473 --> 00:09:51,401
ERICA: Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord.

96
00:09:51,513 --> 00:10:00,413
JOEY: Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites. LAUGH

97
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,290
ERICA: Who's they?

98
00:10:04,593 --> 00:10:06,390
JOEY: No one.

99
00:10:07,596 --> 00:10:19,330
ERICA: Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't. LAUGH

100
00:10:20,308 --> 00:10:22,401
JOEY: Good, otherwise my watch would fall off. 

101
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:39,416
ERICA: No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one? LAUGH

102
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:54,341
JOEY: Alright, just one.  Wow, you're good at that. LAUGH

103
00:10:55,644 --> 00:11:00,308
WAITER: Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?

104
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:05,408
ERICA: Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore.

105
00:11:21,503 --> 00:11:25,529
JANITOR: Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.

106
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:36,340
ROSS: Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men _that_ way. But, um, zoo dollars?

107
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:41,617
JANITOR: It's about your monkey. It's alive.

108
00:11:56,371 --> 00:11:59,431
ERICA: I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?

109
00:12:00,308 --> 00:12:15,312
JOEY: Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something.

110
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:23,521
ERICA: No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?

111
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:25,846
ERICA: I should just be happy to be near you.

112
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,393
JOEY: Hey I- 

113
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:32,498
ERICA: Hey what?

114
00:12:33,308 --> 00:12:38,403
JOEY: That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY!  Hey. He-hey.

115
00:12:46,321 --> 00:13:05,404
PHOEBE:  _There'll be times when you get older   when you'll want to sleep with people   just to make them like you. . .   But don't.   Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do, everybody   That's another thing that you don't wanna do._

116
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:08,270
MONICA: Excellent!

117
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,265
CHANDLER: Very informative!

118
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:11,472
RACHEL: Not at all inappropriate!

119
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,272
PHOEBE: Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.

120
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:21,380
ROB: That was great, the kids loved you.

121
00:13:21,489 --> 00:13:23,423
PHOEBE: Yay, I rock.

122
00:13:24,392 --> 00:13:31,396
ROB: And you know why? Because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the truth.You were incredible.

123
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,489
PHOEBE: But.

124
00:13:34,336 --> 00:13:35,883
ROB: How did you know there was a but?

125
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:40,303
PHOEBE: I sense these things. It was either but or butter.

126
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:49,340
ROB: The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals.

127
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:50,509
PHOEBE: I can do that.

128
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:53,315
ROB: Really?

129
00:13:53,315 --> 00:13:58,451
ROB: Because that would be fantastic. What? You wanna kiss me?

130
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,357
PHOEBE: Thinkin' about it.

131
00:14:03,498 --> 00:14:05,449
If I get a library card,

132
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:07,400
can I take you out some time?

133
00:14:12,374 --> 00:14:13,870
What?

134
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,366
I'm unemployed.

135
00:14:20,382 --> 00:14:32,385
JANITOR: Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe.

136
00:14:33,495 --> 00:14:34,519
ROSS: Buddy, my monkey?

137
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:46,331
JANITOR: Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken.

138
00:14:46,408 --> 00:14:47,955
Along with a snowy egret,

139
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:51,476
a two-toed sloth and three sweatshirts

140
00:14:51,476 --> 00:14:53,341
from the zoo gift shop.

141
00:14:53,515 --> 00:14:56,507
ROSS: Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.

142
00:14:57,352 --> 00:15:01,352
JANITOR: The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya?

143
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:07,285
ROSS: That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.

144
00:15:07,462 --> 00:15:16,462
JANITOR: Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?

145
00:15:17,272 --> 00:15:18,466
ROSS: That guy Lipson?

146
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:22,923
JANITOR: Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?

147
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,470
ROSS: No, I, I only know Lipson.

148
00:15:26,414 --> 00:15:36,907
JANITOR: Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with...

149
00:15:36,907 --> 00:15:38,391
ROSS: Buddy, my monkey, my monkey.

150
00:15:40,395 --> 00:15:46,422
JANITOR: Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo.

151
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:48,298
ROSS: Of course.

152
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:56,340
JANITOR: Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know.

153
00:15:57,412 --> 00:15:59,312
ROSS: This is unbelievable.

154
00:15:59,414 --> 00:16:04,248
JANITOR: So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?

155
00:16:04,486 --> 00:16:07,386
ROSS: Are you trying to get me to bribe you?

156
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:09,354
JANITOR: Maybe.

157
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,291
ROSS: But you already told me everything.

158
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:27,373
ROSS: Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey.

159
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:31,274
RACHEL: Well, so what're you gonna do?

160
00:16:31,312 --> 00:16:34,406
ROSS: Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.

161
00:16:34,482 --> 00:16:37,508
CHANDLER: That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.

162
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,317
PHOEBE: OK, hi again.

163
00:16:40,422 --> 00:16:43,289
ALL: Hi Phoebe.

164
00:16:44,325 --> 00:17:05,274
PHOEBE: Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals.    _Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo,   Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo.   Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up,   And that's how we get hamburgers.   Nooowww, chickens!_

165
00:17:06,281 --> 00:17:08,812
_TV DOCTOR: You're the only one who can save her Drake.

166
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:11,343
JOEY ON TV: Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God._

167
00:17:11,453 --> 00:17:13,478
ROSS: Well, there goes my whole belief system.

168
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,349
ERICA: It's Erica.

169
00:17:17,392 --> 00:17:19,326
JOEY: Oh my God, quick turn off the TV.

170
00:17:19,326 --> 00:17:21,260
RACHEL: No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens.

171
00:17:21,362 --> 00:17:23,454
JOEY: Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out.

172
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:26,290
RACHEL: Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?

173
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:30,303
MONICA: Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon.

174
00:17:33,475 --> 00:17:35,272
JOEY: Hey Erica, c'mon in.

175
00:17:35,343 --> 00:17:38,471
ERICA: How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem?

176
00:17:38,513 --> 00:17:43,409
JOEY: Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?

177
00:17:43,485 --> 00:17:47,299
ERICA: Ohh, and I see you're having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh?

178
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,311
JOEY: Who?

179
00:17:48,423 --> 00:17:53,522
ERICA: Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge.

180
00:17:55,396 --> 00:17:57,330
JOEY: It's not what you think, that was...

181
00:17:57,398 --> 00:17:59,593
ERICA: You told me I was the only one. 

182
00:18:03,371 --> 00:18:16,383
JOEY: Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor.

183
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:20,251
ERICA: Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?

184
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,483
JOEY: Somebody wanna help me out here?

185
00:18:26,261 --> 00:18:28,252
RACHEL: Oh, I know, I know. 

186
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:30,260
Where am I?

187
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:34,394
University Hospital  where you've been for 18 years.

188
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,495
ERICA: How, how can you be here and there.

189
00:18:38,373 --> 00:18:40,273
JOEY: 'Cause it's a television show.

190
00:18:40,475 --> 00:18:42,375
ERICA: Drake, what're you getting at?

191
00:18:44,379 --> 00:18:47,314
Nice girl. Not great with concepts.

192
00:18:48,383 --> 00:18:49,475
JOEY: I'm not Drake.

193
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:55,515
ROSS: That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin.

194
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:03,320
ERICA: Is this true?

195
00:19:03,464 --> 00:19:11,330
RACHEL: Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me. 

196
00:19:17,478 --> 00:19:22,244
MONICA: And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't. 

197
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:27,345
CHANDLER: And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard. 

198
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,451
ERICA: Is all this true?

199
00:19:37,498 --> 00:19:52,479
JOEY: Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you.

200
00:19:53,281 --> 00:19:54,407
ERICA: Oh Hans. 

201
00:19:57,418 --> 00:20:03,323
ROSS: Hans...Hans...Yo evil twin.

202
00:20:03,524 --> 00:20:12,398
JOEY: Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care

203
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:15,334
ERICA: I'll never forget you Hans. 

204
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:21,975
JOEY: OK, alright, the people who threw the water.

205
00:20:21,975 --> 00:20:24,443
Helping you out.

206
00:20:24,512 --> 00:20:27,505
PHOEBE: Fired! Why?

207
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:33,310
ROB: The library board has had a lot of complaints from parents about some of the stuff in your songs.

208
00:20:33,521 --> 00:20:47,432
PHOEBE: I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?

209
00:20:48,436 --> 00:20:49,528
ROB: No.

210
00:20:51,572 --> 00:20:53,369
PHOEBE: I see.

211
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:57,433
ROB: Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs.

212
00:20:57,478 --> 00:21:04,479
PHOEBE: No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?

213
00:21:05,486 --> 00:21:07,386
ROB: I'm not saying you have to be Barney.

214
00:21:07,386 --> 00:21:09,286
PHOEBE: Who's Barney.

215
00:21:15,396 --> 00:21:16,522
You'll never believe it.

216
00:21:17,332 --> 00:21:17,878
Let me guess.

217
00:21:17,878 --> 00:21:18,424
What?

218
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:22,299
Some Weebles actually do fall down?

219
00:21:22,503 --> 00:21:24,471
A stitch in time now only saves seven?

220
00:21:24,471 --> 00:21:26,439
What do you got?

221
00:21:27,508 --> 00:21:31,410
Well never mind.

222
00:21:31,546 --> 00:21:32,535
What? What?

223
00:21:33,348 --> 00:21:40,509
ROSS: Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming _Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan_.

224
00:21:40,555 --> 00:21:42,318
RACHEL: You're kidding.

225
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:43,407
JOEY: This is amazing.

226
00:21:43,407 --> 00:21:44,357
ROSS: I know.

227
00:21:44,459 --> 00:21:47,621
JOEY: I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.

228
00:21:49,564 --> 00:21:51,327
PHOEBE: OK, Rachel, I'm ready.

229
00:21:55,536 --> 00:22:00,302
KID: Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth?

230
00:22:00,575 --> 00:22:02,304
PHOEBE: Um, yeah I guess that's me.

231
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:06,269
KID:  She's here.

232
00:22:14,322 --> 00:22:26,299
PHOEBE:  _Sometimes men love women,   sometimes men love men,   and then there are bisexuals,   though some just say they're kidding themselves.   la la-la-la la-la-la-la-la-la-la..._

233
00:22:35,443 --> 00:22:38,310
ROSS: This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year.

234
00:22:38,413 --> 00:22:45,508
CHANDLER: What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?

235
00:22:46,354 --> 00:22:49,353
SECURITY GUARD: C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

236
00:22:49,424 --> 00:22:51,618
ROSS: Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?

237
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,520
SECURITY GUARD: I'm sorry guys, closed set.

238
00:22:53,561 --> 00:22:59,424
ROSS: Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together.

239
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:02,459
SECURITY GUARD: Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper.

240
00:23:05,473 --> 00:23:06,462
MONICA: Ross, there he is.

241
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:11,470
ROSS: Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel. 

242
00:23:18,386 --> 00:23:19,478
In the jungle

243
00:23:20,288 --> 00:23:21,516
The mighty jungle

244
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,485
The lion sleeps tonight

245
00:23:27,528 --> 00:23:29,012
In the jungle

246
00:23:29,012 --> 00:23:30,496
The mighty jungle

247
00:23:30,531 --> 00:23:33,500
The lion sleeps tonight

248
00:24:04,265 --> 00:24:05,459
SECURITY GUARD: Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh...

249
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,300
JOEY: Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey. 

250
00:24:11,405 --> 00:24:16,402
ROSS: Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante. 

251
00:24:20,314 --> 00:24:23,283
JOEY: Woah, dude, burn.

252
00:24:23,384 --> 00:24:27,286
ROSS: I don't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday.

253
00:24:27,388 --> 00:24:31,484
TRAINER: Hey don't take it personal, he's under a lot of pressure, ya know, starring in a movie and all.

254
00:24:33,394 --> 00:24:35,385
RACHEL: Now just how big of a star is Marcel?

255
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:40,430
TRAINER: In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard.

256
00:24:43,504 --> 00:24:47,440
CHANDLER:  So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid.

257
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,891
DIRECTOR'S ASSISTANT: Hey Sal, Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway set?

258
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:56,448
JOEY: Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?

259
00:24:56,517 --> 00:24:58,610
DIRECTOR'S ASSISTANT: The one in the director's chair.

260
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,369
JOEY: Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me.

261
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:06,358
PHOEBE: OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?

262
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:17,460
JOEY: Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'?

263
00:25:24,412 --> 00:25:25,458
SUSIE: We've got a problem.

264
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:26,504
DIRECTOR'S ASSISTANT: Tell me.

265
00:25:27,281 --> 00:25:30,579
SUSIE: I can't do Chris's makeup. She refuses to acknowledge that she has a moustasche.

266
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:32,849
DIRECTOR'S ASSISTANT: Is it bad?

267
00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:39,482
SUSIE: It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan.

268
00:25:41,295 --> 00:25:42,489
DIRECTOR'S ASSISTANT: I'll talk to her.

269
00:25:43,331 --> 00:25:44,593
SUSIE: I hate actors.

270
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:49,491
CHANDLER:  Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya.

271
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,529
SUSIE: Excuse me.

272
00:25:56,611 --> 00:25:58,442
SUSIE: Uh, is your name Chandler?

273
00:25:58,546 --> 00:25:59,945
CHANDLER: Uh, yes, yes it is.

274
00:25:59,945 --> 00:26:01,344
SUSIE: Chandler Bing?

275
00:26:01,382 --> 00:26:05,250
CHANDLER: Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?

276
00:26:05,386 --> 00:26:21,291
SUSIE: I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse.   CHANDLER: Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up.

277
00:26:21,402 --> 00:26:25,498
SUSIE: It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.

278
00:26:26,273 --> 00:26:29,503
CHANDLER: Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.

279
00:26:30,277 --> 00:26:36,414
SUSIE: Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants.

280
00:26:37,518 --> 00:26:44,483
CHANDLER: Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore.

281
00:26:46,527 --> 00:26:48,506
So? What have you

282
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,485
been doing since childhood?

283
00:26:51,298 --> 00:26:54,290
Well, I got a new belt.

284
00:26:54,502 --> 00:26:55,491
I wondered.

285
00:27:00,274 --> 00:27:00,854
MONICA: Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

286
00:27:00,854 --> 00:27:01,434

00:27:14,355 --> 00:27:16,403
RACHEL: No, was he any good in it?

MONICA: Rachel, he like, totally changed time.

RACHEL: Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?

293
00:27:23,497 --> 00:27:27,263
RACHEL: What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?

294
00:27:27,301 --> 00:27:28,359
MONICA: He could hear me.

295
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,966
RACHEL: OK, I'm doin' it for ya.

296
00:27:30,966 --> 00:27:36,273
MONICA: Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook.

VAN DAMME: You don't think I'm cute?

301
00:27:56,297 --> 00:28:10,231
RACHEL: I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?

302

VAN DAMME: You can tell her I think her friend is cute.

303
00:28:23,457 --> 00:28:28,485
CHANDLER: No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows.

SUSIE: Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date.

310
00:28:51,385 --> 00:28:57,313
CHANDLER: Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock.

311
00:28:57,424 --> 00:29:03,457
SUSIE: I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.

312
00:29:10,237 --> 00:29:12,262
CHANDLER: No one was around to hear that?

313
00:29:17,344 --> 00:29:18,470
MONICA: So what'd he say?

314
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:29,455
RACHEL: Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no.

315
00:29:32,459 --> 00:29:34,256
MONICA: Well, thanks anyway.

317
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:44,462
MONICA: Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do...

318
00:29:44,572 --> 00:29:48,302
RACHEL: Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you.

RACHEL: Does anybody need anything?

323
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:23,500
MONICA: Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself.

324
00:30:26,513 --> 00:30:27,525
RACHEL: That is so unfair.

325
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:33,412
PHOEBE: I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme.

326
00:30:34,421 --> 00:30:40,418
ROSS: Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours.

CHANDLER: Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done.

00:30:58,479 --> 00:31:00,310
PHOEBE: Oh, OK, I don't eat meat.

334
00:31:01,415 --> 00:31:03,575
CHANDLER: Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?

00:31:04,318 --> 00:31:07,310
PHOEBE: Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell.

CHANDLER: OK, then, eat me, I'm done.

337
00:31:12,526 --> 00:31:23,299
CHANDLER: I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'

338
00:31:24,338 --> 00:31:25,885
MONICA: What did you say?

339
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:32,009
CHANDLER: Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?

340
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:33,607
PHOEBE: Oh, you just know.

341
00:31:43,424 --> 00:31:46,416
SUSIE: Oh, shoot, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes.

00:32:07,314 --> 00:32:16,288
CHANDLER: Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there.

346
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:23,386
SUSIE: Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner.

347
00:32:28,302 --> 00:32:30,395
CHANDLER: You want me to wear your panties?

SUSIE: Could ya?

349
00:32:32,406 --> 00:32:46,309

The moment we should have

360
00:34:05,499 --> 00:34:17,266
