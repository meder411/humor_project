1
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,356
JOEY: Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?

2
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:14,391
CHANDLER: That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years. LAUGH

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,329
JOEY: What?

4
00:00:18,407 --> 00:00:26,244
CHANDLER: The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put. LAUGH

5
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:27,407
JOEY: Yeah, so.

6
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,410
CHANDLER: Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush.  You used my toothbrush? LAUGH

7
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:35,322
You used my toothbrush!

8
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:40,217
JOEY: Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain.

9
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:48,360
CHANDLER: Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere. LAUGH

10
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:53,368
JOEY: Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?

11
00:00:53,476 --> 00:00:57,378
CHANDLER: Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.

12
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:05,218
JOEY: Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash. LAUGH

13
00:01:55,371 --> 00:01:59,431
JOEY: Hey. LAUGH

14
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:01,323
PHOEBE: Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?

15
00:02:01,323 --> 00:02:03,171
that's in a coma?

16
00:02:03,312 --> 00:02:05,371
He's having a brunch. LAUGH

17
00:02:06,315 --> 00:02:07,748
PHOEBE: Ahh.

18
00:02:07,748 --> 00:02:09,181
RACHEL:  OK, ready when you are.

19
00:02:09,285 --> 00:02:12,185
PHOEBE: Okey-doke.

20
00:02:12,221 --> 00:02:14,189
MONICA: I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.

21
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,384
CHANDLER: Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?

22
00:02:18,194 --> 00:02:20,388
RACHEL: Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him.

23
00:02:21,297 --> 00:02:23,390
I'm getting a lily.

24
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:27,225
For my mom, because her name's Lily. LAUGH

25
00:02:27,436 --> 00:02:29,819
That's lucky. What if her name

26
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,202
was Big Ugly Splotch?

27
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:34,272
Where you getting it?

28
00:02:34,272 --> 00:02:35,335
My shoulder.

29
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:36,907
What?

30
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,403
What's on your shoulder?

31
00:02:39,215 --> 00:02:41,206
A chip.

32
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:45,420
I've got a big attitude problem. LAUGH

33
00:02:46,322 --> 00:02:47,818
A tattoo. I'm getting a tattoo.

34
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:49,314
A tattoo?

35
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:52,417
Why? Why would you wanna do that?

36
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:55,442
You don't think they're kind of cool?

37
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,455
No. Sorry, I don't.

38
00:02:58,234 --> 00:02:59,718
Why would anyone pay

39
00:02:59,718 --> 00:03:01,202
to scar their body for life?

40
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,363
What if it doesn't come out right?

41
00:03:03,405 --> 00:03:05,339
It's like having a bad haircut

42
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:07,273
all the time. LAUGH

43
00:03:08,377 --> 00:03:11,210
Why is everyone staring at me?

44
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,793
Sign this card for Dad.

45
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,306
Richard will be here soon.

46
00:03:14,383 --> 00:03:16,334
He's going to the party?

47
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:18,285
He's my parents' best friend.

48
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:19,934
So is today the day

49
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:21,481
you tell them about you two?

50
00:03:22,224 --> 00:03:24,306
Yeah, for my dad's birthday,

51
00:03:24,306 --> 00:03:26,388
I decided to give him a stroke. LAUGH

52
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:29,322
No, I think you should tell them.

53
00:03:29,398 --> 00:03:31,298
I don't know how serious he is.

54
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:33,198
Until I do, I say nothing.

55
00:03:33,302 --> 00:03:34,348
I don't think

56
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:35,394
Mom and Dad would mind.

57
00:03:35,437 --> 00:03:37,371
Remember when you were 9

58
00:03:37,371 --> 00:03:39,305
and Richard was 30, Dad said:

59
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:41,502
''God, I hope they get together.''

60
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:47,343
Hello? LAUGH

61
00:03:47,343 --> 00:03:48,338
-I'm double-parked.

62
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:50,248
Okay. Come on, Ross.

63
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:54,888
Bye, you.

64
00:03:54,888 --> 00:03:56,321
Bye.

65
00:04:01,363 --> 00:04:03,354
Bye, you. LAUGH

66
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:15,926
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.

67
00:04:15,926 --> 00:04:18,377
Okay, wait, wait. LAUGH

68
00:04:19,381 --> 00:04:21,281
It's gonna be fine.

69
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:23,181
Are you not nervous?

70
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:24,817
I'm terrified.

71
00:04:24,817 --> 00:04:26,415
This is just a very absorbent suit. LAUGH

72
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:28,184
Shall we?

73
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,179
Yes.

74
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:30,419
No. You know what?

75
00:04:31,193 --> 00:04:32,740
Ross, let's switch places.

76
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,287
Get in the middle.

77
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,877
This looks like we're trying

78
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:37,424
to cover something up.

79
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,248
You could come in straddling him,

80
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:42,296
they still wouldn't believe it. LAUGH

81
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,298
We're here!

82
00:04:45,407 --> 00:04:48,399
Hi, kids! Hi, darling!

83
00:04:48,444 --> 00:04:49,928
Happy birthday, Dad.

84
00:04:49,928 --> 00:04:51,412
Thank you.

85
00:04:51,447 --> 00:04:52,436
Happy birthday!

86
00:04:53,215 --> 00:04:54,312
You kids thanked

87
00:04:54,312 --> 00:04:55,409
Dr. Burke for the ride?

88
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:57,851
Actually, Mom, I think Monica

89
00:04:57,851 --> 00:05:00,251
thanked him for the both of us. LAUGH

90
00:05:01,257 --> 00:05:03,248
So you kids take the train in?

91
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,192
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.

92
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:09,260
Speaking of whom, I hear he's got

93
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,258
some 20-year-old twinkie in the city. LAUGH

94
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:17,839
Finger cramp! Oh, God!

95
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,307
Sorry. Here, let me get that, Mom.

96
00:05:20,376 --> 00:05:22,890
So Richard's shopping

97
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,404
in the junior section?

98
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:27,375
Are we still on that?

99
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,412
You just know she's got

100
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,408
the IQ of a napkin.

101
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:34,178
She's probably not even pretty.

102
00:05:34,223 --> 00:05:36,202
Just young enough so that

103
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,181
everything is still pointing up. LAUGH

104
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:47,301
Can you believe this?

105
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:49,201
It's a great apartment.

106
00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:50,801
In the bathroom,

107
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:52,297
there's mirrors on both sides.

108
00:05:52,408 --> 00:05:55,400
It's like peeing with the Rockettes.

109
00:05:56,245 --> 00:05:59,214
Well, there's my fantasy come true. LAUGH

110
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:01,249
No, seriously.

111
00:06:02,284 --> 00:06:04,314
We were just saying, great apartment!

112
00:06:04,314 --> 00:06:06,344
Thanks. You want it?

113
00:06:06,388 --> 00:06:08,322
I'm moving to a bigger place.

114
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:10,256
You should take this one.

115
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,673
Can you see me in a place like this?

116
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,186
Why not?

117
00:06:14,263 --> 00:06:16,760
You hate park views and high ceilings?

118
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,257
Come on, I'll show you the kitchen.

119
00:06:20,302 --> 00:06:21,752
That's okay,

120
00:06:21,752 --> 00:06:23,202
I saw a kitchen this morning.

121
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:24,836
On TV.

122
00:06:24,836 --> 00:06:26,400
Stop talking. Okay!

123
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,256
Come on, tell us! LAUGH

124
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,302
Is she really 20?

125
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:32,370
I am not telling you anything.

126
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:34,381
Come on, it's my birthday.

127
00:06:34,381 --> 00:06:36,281
Let me live vicariously!

128
00:06:36,318 --> 00:06:38,309
You don't want to do that.

129
00:06:38,387 --> 00:06:39,883
What's a little midlife crisis

130
00:06:39,883 --> 00:06:41,379
between friends?

131
00:06:41,423 --> 00:06:42,822
Let it go.

132
00:06:42,822 --> 00:06:44,221
I know what it's like.

133
00:06:44,293 --> 00:06:46,858
When I turned 50, I got the Porsche.

134
00:06:46,858 --> 00:06:49,423
You got your own little speedster. LAUGH

135
00:06:50,232 --> 00:06:51,779
Seriously, it's not like that.

136
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,326
Tell you what.

137
00:06:53,402 --> 00:06:55,319
Maybe one weekend

138
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,236
you can borrow the car and I could--

139
00:06:57,306 --> 00:06:58,403
I beg you not

140
00:06:58,403 --> 00:06:59,500
to finish that sentence! LAUGH

141
00:07:00,175 --> 00:07:02,143
What? I'm kidding!

142
00:07:02,244 --> 00:07:03,791
You know I'd never let him

143
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,338
touch the Porsche.

144
00:07:12,354 --> 00:07:14,805
Okay, Rach. Which lily?

145
00:07:14,805 --> 00:07:17,256
This lily or that lily?

146
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,206
Well, I--

147
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:20,252
I like this lily. LAUGH

148
00:07:20,295 --> 00:07:22,877
It's more open. That's like my mom.

149
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:25,459
She had a more open, giving spirit.

150
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:28,293
Foghorn Leghorn! LAUGH

151
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:32,340
Blond girl? You're in room two.

152
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,275
Not-so-blond girl, you're with me. LAUGH

153
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,278
Here we go!

154
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:40,181
You're not going.

155
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:43,231
Is this because of what Ross said?

156
00:07:43,231 --> 00:07:45,279
No.

157
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:46,871
Well, yeah, maybe.

158
00:07:46,871 --> 00:07:48,321
I don't believe this.

159
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,858
Is this how this relationship is

160
00:07:50,858 --> 00:07:53,326
gonna work? Ross equals boss? LAUGH

161
00:07:53,395 --> 00:07:56,193
Come on, what is this, 1 922?

162
00:07:56,331 --> 00:07:58,196
What's 1 922?

163
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,131
Just, you know, a long time ago. LAUGH

164
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:03,801
When men used to tell women

165
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:05,331
what to do a lot.

166
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:08,137
Then there was suffrage, which

167
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:10,133
was good. But it sounds horrible. LAUGH

168
00:08:13,148 --> 00:08:14,746
Do you want this tattoo?

169
00:08:14,746 --> 00:08:16,344
I do. It's just that Ross--

170
00:08:16,385 --> 00:08:18,768
Okay, hey!

171
00:08:18,768 --> 00:08:21,151
Is your boyfriend the boss of you?

172
00:08:21,356 --> 00:08:22,823
No.

173
00:08:22,823 --> 00:08:24,290
Okay, who is the boss of you?

174
00:08:26,161 --> 00:08:27,253
You? LAUGH

175
00:08:28,163 --> 00:08:30,393
No! You are the boss of you!

176
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,714
You march in there and get

177
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:36,262
that heart tattooed on your hip! Go! LAUGH

178
00:08:39,274 --> 00:08:41,242
I haven't even gotten my tattoo

179
00:08:41,242 --> 00:08:43,210
and I'm already tougher. LAUGH

180
00:08:48,183 --> 00:08:49,207
How you doing?

181
00:08:49,284 --> 00:08:51,377
I'm a twinkie!

182
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:54,417
Really? I'm a hero.

183
00:08:57,192 --> 00:08:58,420
This is so hard. LAUGH

184
00:08:59,194 --> 00:09:02,163
Yeah, I know. I hate it too.

185
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:05,132
Look, maybe we should just tell them.

186
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:06,730
Maybe we should just tell

187
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,226
your parents first.

188
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,170
My parents are dead.

189
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,175
God, you are so lucky! LAUGH

190
00:09:15,244 --> 00:09:16,694
I mean-- You know what I mean.

191
00:09:16,694 --> 00:09:18,144
I know.

192
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:20,340
Just hang in there, okay?

193
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:22,765
Okay, I'll go out first, all right?

194
00:09:22,765 --> 00:09:25,148
All right.

195
00:09:29,157 --> 00:09:30,704
Judy! Going to the bathroom.

196
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,251
Good for you!

197
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:37,379
Thank you, Richard. LAUGH

198
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:39,461
I appreciate the support.

199
00:09:43,272 --> 00:09:45,769
Honey. Seen my Harmon Killebrew bat? LAUGH

200
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:48,266
Bob won't believe I have one.

201
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,175
I have no idea.

202
00:09:50,312 --> 00:09:52,246
Did you know Richard

203
00:09:52,246 --> 00:09:54,180
has a twinkie in the city?

204
00:09:54,283 --> 00:09:56,331
I know. He's like a new man.

205
00:09:56,331 --> 00:09:58,379
It's like a scene from Cocoon. LAUGH

206
00:09:59,187 --> 00:10:00,734
I never would have pictured

207
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,281
Richard with a bimbo.

208
00:10:02,324 --> 00:10:04,275
He told Johnny Shapiro

209
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:06,226
that she's quite a girl.

210
00:10:06,295 --> 00:10:09,196
He said he's falling in love with her.

211
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:10,748
Really?

212
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:12,198
I've never seen him this happy.

213
00:10:12,234 --> 00:10:14,316
So, Jack. Ever think about trading

214
00:10:14,316 --> 00:10:16,398
me in for a younger model?

215
00:10:16,505 --> 00:10:19,201
Of course not.

216
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:21,304
With you, it's like

217
00:10:21,304 --> 00:10:23,300
I've got two 25-year-olds. LAUGH

218
00:10:26,315 --> 00:10:28,215
Oh, Jack, stop!

219
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,218
Come on!

220
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:33,445
It's my birthday!

221
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:39,389
Can we drop this? I am not

222
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,419
interested in the guy's apartment.

223
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,981
Please. I saw the way you were

224
00:10:43,981 --> 00:10:46,432
checking out his moldings. You want it. LAUGH

225
00:10:46,535 --> 00:10:48,952
Why would I want another apartment?

226
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:51,369
I've already got one I love.

227
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,340
It wouldn't kill you

228
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,240
to say it once in a while. LAUGH

229
00:10:57,446 --> 00:10:59,880
All right. You want the truth?

230
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,314
I'm thinking about it.

231
00:11:02,384 --> 00:11:03,334
What?

232
00:11:03,334 --> 00:11:04,284
I'm sorry.

233
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,349
I'm 28. I've never lived alone

234
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:10,874
and I'm finally at a place where I got enough money

235
00:11:10,874 --> 00:11:13,325
that I don't need a roommate anymore.

236
00:11:13,395 --> 00:11:15,863
I don't need a roommate either.

237
00:11:15,863 --> 00:11:18,331
I can afford to live here by myself.

238
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,800
I may have to bring in somebody

239
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,200
every week to lick the silverware. LAUGH

240
00:11:23,305 --> 00:11:25,802
Why are you so bent out of shape? We

241
00:11:25,802 --> 00:11:28,299
didn't agree to live together forever.

242
00:11:28,343 --> 00:11:30,436
We're not Bert and Ernie.

243
00:11:32,314 --> 00:11:34,362
I'm aware that we're not LAUGH

244
00:11:34,362 --> 00:11:36,410
gay puppets, all right?

245
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:38,343
You know what?

246
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,871
If this is the way you feel,

247
00:11:40,871 --> 00:11:43,322
then maybe you should take it.

248
00:11:43,358 --> 00:11:44,387
That's how I feel.

249
00:11:44,387 --> 00:11:45,416
Then take it!

250
00:11:46,228 --> 00:11:46,774
Maybe I will!

251
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:47,320
Fine!

252
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:50,427
Great! You can spend more time

253
00:11:50,427 --> 00:11:53,425
with your real friends, the spoons!

254
00:11:54,336 --> 00:11:57,237
Whose drink can I freshen? LAUGH

255
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,367
Almost time for cake! LAUGH

256
00:12:10,385 --> 00:12:12,285
Mon, are you okay? LAUGH

257
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,350
You remember that video

258
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,380
I found of Mom and Dad?

259
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:19,422
Well, I just caught the live show. LAUGH

260
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,212
Hey, there.

261
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,224
MONICA: Hey there.

262
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:31,394
RICHARD: What?

263
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:34,204
MONICA: Nothing, I just heard something nice about you.

264
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:37,878
RICHARD: Humm, really?

265
00:12:37,878 --> 00:12:40,346
MRS. GELLER: Richard. Richard. Your son isn't seeing anyone is he?

266
00:12:40,415 --> 00:12:45,409
RICHARD: Uhh, not that I know of. LAUGH

267
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:49,424
MRS. GELLER: Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?

268
00:12:49,524 --> 00:12:53,220
RICHARD: That - that's an idea.

269
00:12:53,328 --> 00:12:54,317
MONICA: Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.

270
00:12:58,366 --> 00:13:03,166
ROSS: Ohh. LAUGH

271
00:13:03,205 --> 00:13:09,706
MRS. GELLER: She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?

272
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,203
and some aren't. Is that crystal? LAUGH

273
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:16,284
ROSS: Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?

274
00:13:17,185 --> 00:13:19,278
MRS. GELLER: So, who's the mystery man?

275
00:13:19,387 --> 00:13:21,184
MONICA: Well, uh, he's a doctor.

276
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:28,194
MRS. GELLER: A real doctor? LAUGH

277
00:13:29,197 --> 00:13:30,294
And he's sweet,

278
00:13:30,294 --> 00:13:31,391
and I know you'd like him.

279
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,497
MONICA: No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him. 

280
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,199
MRS. GELLER: Well that's wonderful. . . I LAUGH

281
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,407
MONICA: Mom, it's OK.

282
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:51,214
RICHARD: It is Judy. LAUGH

283
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,420
MRS. GELLER: Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!

284
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,320
MR. GELLER:  Found it. LAUGH

285
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,356
ROSS: I'll take that dad. 

286
00:14:03,265 --> 00:14:07,167
MRS. GELLER: It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item. LAUGH

287
00:14:07,402 --> 00:14:09,199
MR. GELLER: That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city.

288
00:14:09,404 --> 00:14:10,433
MONICA: Dad, I'm the twinkie.

289
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:11,462
MR. GELLER: You're the twinkie?

290
00:14:12,307 --> 00:14:15,367
RICHARD: She's not a twinkie.

291
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,174
MONICA: Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . .

292
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,216
MRS. GELLER: Oh please, a relationship.

293
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:23,813
MONICA: Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man.

294
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:25,309
RICHARD: Really?

295
00:14:25,387 --> 00:14:29,413
MONICA: Yes.

296
00:14:30,192 --> 00:14:34,288
MR. GELLER: Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?

297
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:35,318
MONICA: Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier.

298
00:14:35,397 --> 00:14:39,493
MR. GELLER: When did I say that? LAUGH

299
00:14:57,319 --> 00:15:00,345


300
00:15:00,388 --> 00:15:02,271
I know, so do I.

301
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:04,154
I'm so glad you made me do this.

302
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:06,352
Okay, let me see yours.

303
00:15:09,264 --> 00:15:11,289
Let's see yours again. LAUGH

304
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:14,280
We just saw mine. Let me see yours.

305
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,293
Oh, okay.

306
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:19,269
Oh, no!

307
00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:22,856
It's gone! That's so weird. LAUGH

308
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:25,404
I don't know where it went.

309
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:29,246
You didn't get it?

310
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:30,309
No.

311
00:15:30,485 --> 00:15:31,901
Why not?

312
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:33,317
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

313
00:15:33,388 --> 00:15:34,838
How could you do this?

314
00:15:34,838 --> 00:15:36,288
This was your idea!

315
00:15:36,324 --> 00:15:38,320
I know! I was gonna get it,

316
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,316
but he came in with this needle.

317
00:15:40,395 --> 00:15:42,295
Did you know

318
00:15:42,295 --> 00:15:44,195
they do this with needles? LAUGH

319
00:15:44,232 --> 00:15:46,200
Really? You don't say?

320
00:15:46,234 --> 00:15:49,397
Because mine was licked on by kittens! LAUGH

321
00:15:50,305 --> 00:15:51,852
I'm sorry.

322
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:53,399
Seriously, does it hurt a lot?

323
00:15:53,441 --> 00:15:57,241
No, it's just a pinch. Like that--

324
00:15:57,312 --> 00:15:59,212
Oh, my God! LAUGH

325
00:16:00,181 --> 00:16:01,762
That really hurt me!

326
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:03,343
Oh, that's gonna leave a mark.

327
00:16:08,356 --> 00:16:10,187
I'm sorry about what--

328
00:16:10,258 --> 00:16:11,725
Yeah, me too.

329
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:18,264
JOEY: I know. Yeah. LAUGH

330
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,393
CHANDLER: Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .

331
00:16:22,203 --> 00:16:24,171
JOEY: No, we're alright. LAUGH

332
00:16:25,173 --> 00:16:30,293
CHANDLER: So I got ya something. 

333
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:32,176
JOEY: Plastic spoons. Great. LAUGH

334
00:16:32,314 --> 00:16:36,410
CHANDLER: Lick away my man.

335
00:16:37,185 --> 00:16:38,277
JOEY: These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones.

336
00:16:38,386 --> 00:16:42,378
CHANDLER: What? LAUGH

337
00:16:43,224 --> 00:16:46,216
JOEY: Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment.

338
00:16:46,428 --> 00:16:48,879
CHANDLER: No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?

339
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:51,330
JOEY: I'm movin' out like we talked about. LAUGH

340
00:16:52,434 --> 00:16:55,335
I thought that was just a fight.

341
00:16:55,403 --> 00:17:02,166
CHANDLER: Well I didn't think that was serious.  Ya know I thought that was just a fight.

342
00:17:02,243 --> 00:17:03,807
I think it would be good for me.

343
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:07,375
Help me to grow or whatever.

344
00:17:11,186 --> 00:17:13,279
JOEY: Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever. LAUGH

345
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:18,382
CHANDLER: Well, there you go.

346
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:27,256
JOEY: Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry. LAUGH

347
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:30,202
Put the foosball table in there.

348
00:17:31,373 --> 00:17:34,240
CHANDLER: Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there.

349
00:17:36,311 --> 00:17:38,472
JOEY: Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?

350
00:17:41,383 --> 00:17:43,897
CHANDLER: I did pay for half of it.

351
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,411
JOEY: Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half.

352
00:17:47,188 --> 00:17:52,292
CHANDLER: Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it.

353
00:17:52,494 --> 00:17:56,430
JOEY: Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass. LAUGH

354
00:18:03,438 --> 00:18:05,235
CHANDLER: Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.

355
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:11,209
