1
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:12,775
Monica: 

2
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:29,370
Phoebe: Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it.  Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him? LAUGH

3
00:00:29,514 --> 00:00:31,510
Susan: Oh, is he hungry already?

4
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,506
Carol: I guess so. 

5
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:42,289
Chandler: You know, it's... 

6
00:00:43,294 --> 00:00:44,488
Joey:  I gotta get one, too.

7
00:00:47,432 --> 00:00:49,400
Ross:  What are you guys doing? LAUGH

8
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,300
Chandler: We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle? LAUGH

9
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:58,431
Ross: Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world.

10
00:00:58,543 --> 00:01:01,443
Joey: Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it. LAUGH

11
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:18,928
Ross: This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on.

12
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:20,361
Ross: Carol?

13
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:27,268
Chandler: Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?

14
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:29,268
Carol: Sure.

15
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:32,467
Joey: Uh, does it hurt?

16
00:01:34,278 --> 00:01:36,371
Carol: It did at first, but not anymore.

17
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:37,503
Joey: Chandler?

18
00:01:39,484 --> 00:01:42,476
Chandler: So, uh, how often can you do it?

19
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:44,513
Carol: As much as he needs.

20
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:54,296
Joey: Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?

21
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,280
Julie: Rachel, do you have any muffins left?

22
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:45,896
Rachel: Yeah, I forget which ones.

23
00:02:45,896 --> 00:02:49,001
Julie: Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one?

24
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:50,417
All: No thanks.

25
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:55,359
Julie: 

26
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:59,490
Rachel:  What a bitch.

27
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:11,236
Julie: Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at _Bloomingdale's_ who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it? LAUGH

28
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:15,277
Phoebe: I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet. LAUGH

29
00:03:18,482 --> 00:03:19,466
Monica: Ok, um, I'll go with you.

30
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:20,450
Julie: Great.

31
00:03:23,354 --> 00:03:24,304
Ross:  Hi, honey.

32
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,254
Chandler: Hey, sweetums. LAUGH

33
00:03:26,357 --> 00:03:28,382
Ross: Hello to the rest.

34
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:35,460
Joey: Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?

35
00:03:35,499 --> 00:03:37,433
Monica: It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?

36
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:43,406
Chandler: Come on, you're going to _Bloomingdale's_ with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship. LAUGH

37
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:51,380
Phoebe: Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street. LAUGH

38
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,481
Ross:  So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?

39
00:03:59,423 --> 00:04:01,874
Monica: Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal.

40
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:06,419
Ross: It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this.

41
00:04:06,464 --> 00:04:08,329
Monica: You're welcome.

42
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:31,404
Joey:  Hey Annabelle. LAUGH

43
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,468
Annabelle: Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy? LAUGH

44
00:04:33,468 --> 00:04:34,480
Joey: Who?

45
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:40,389
Annabelle: Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man.

46
00:04:49,273 --> 00:04:50,365
Hombre Man: 

47
00:04:55,313 --> 00:04:57,372
Joey: What's he doin' in my section?

48
00:04:57,481 --> 00:04:59,346
Annabelle: I guess he doesn't know.

49
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:09,325
Joey: Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok?  Hey, how ya doin'?

50
00:05:09,427 --> 00:05:11,327
Hombre Man: Mornin'.

51
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:20,362
Joey: Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory.

52
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,331
Hombre Man: Your territory, huh? LAUGH

53
00:05:25,443 --> 00:05:26,393
Joey: Yeah. Bijan for men?

54
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:27,343
Guy: No thanks.

55
00:05:27,445 --> 00:05:29,242
Hombre Man: Hombre?

56
00:05:29,347 --> 00:05:31,474
Guy: Yeah. All right. 

57
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:40,280
Hombre Man:  You were saying? LAUGH

58
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:47,297
Monica: Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day. LAUGH

59
00:05:47,398 --> 00:05:48,427
Phoebe: What?

60
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:49,456
Monica: We were shopping, and we had lunch.

61
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,461
Phoebe: Oh, all right. What did I have?

62
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,282
Monica: You had a salad.

63
00:05:54,282 --> 00:05:56,295
Phoebe: Oh, no wonder I don't feel full.

64
00:05:56,374 --> 00:05:57,398
Rachel:  Hey, guys, what's up.

65
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,402
Phoebe: I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad.

66
00:06:03,214 --> 00:06:05,238
Rachel: Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?

67
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:13,314
Phoebe: Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur.

68
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:18,226
Rachel: You went shopping for fur?

69
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:27,533
Phoebe: Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some,  uh, boobs.

70
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,468
Rachel: You bought boobs?

71
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:44,445
Phoebe:  Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.

72
00:06:47,491 --> 00:07:00,393
Joey:  Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee.

73
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:04,235
Annabelle: Oh, actually I sorta have plans.

74
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:09,439
Hombre Man:  Ready, Annabelle? LAUGH

75
00:07:11,248 --> 00:07:16,445
Annabelle: You bet.  Maybe some other time?

76
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:34,267
Joey:  Bijan for men?! LAUGH

77
00:07:35,473 --> 00:07:41,343
Carol: Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep.

78
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:49,378
Ross: Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son. LAUGH

79
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:57,449
Susan: Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.  Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.

80
00:07:59,463 --> 00:08:01,294
Rachel: Oh, this is so cute.

81
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,229
Susan: Oh, I got that for him.

82
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:10,434
Ross: My mommies love me. That's clever. LAUGH

83
00:08:11,442 --> 00:08:27,221
Monica: Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju LAUGH

84
00:08:27,358 --> 00:08:29,349
Rachel: Did you just say Hi, Jew?

85
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:39,427
Monica: Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.

86
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,838
He's going through

87
00:08:44,838 --> 00:08:46,436
this whole religious thing.

88
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,444
Monica: Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.

89
00:08:55,286 --> 00:08:57,345
Phoebe: Ben, dinner! LAUGH

90
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:03,290
Ross: Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that.

91
00:09:03,394 --> 00:09:06,420
Phoebe: Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok. 

92
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:12,293
Chandler: What did you just do? LAUGH

93
00:09:12,403 --> 00:09:14,303
Phoebe: I licked my arm, what?

94
00:09:14,338 --> 00:09:16,289
Ross: It's breast milk.

95
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,240
Phoebe: So?

96
00:09:18,342 --> 00:09:21,402
Rachel: Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person.

97
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:25,305
Joey: What is the big deal? LAUGH

98
00:09:27,351 --> 00:09:29,319
Chandler: What did you just do?

99
00:09:31,422 --> 00:09:34,448
Ross: Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?

100
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:37,794
Phoebe: You won't even taste it?

101
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:39,261
Ross: No!

102
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,421
Phoebe: Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?

103
00:09:42,232 --> 00:09:46,328
Ross: Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.

104
00:09:53,477 --> 00:09:55,411
Monica: Hey, where is everybody?

105
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,345
Rachel: They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?

106
00:09:57,481 --> 00:10:05,501
Monica: Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket.

107
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:13,294
Rachel: Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. LAUGH

108
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,360
Rachel: Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?

109
00:10:23,474 --> 00:10:29,369
Monica: You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card. LAUGH

110
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,310
Rachel: And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket?

111
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:38,413
Monica: That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent. LAUGH

112
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,520
Rachel: Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?

113
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,856
Monica: Judy.

114
00:10:43,856 --> 00:10:44,385
Rachel: Who?

115
00:10:44,495 --> 00:10:44,961
Monica: Julie.

116
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:45,427
Rachel: What?!

117
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:47,326
Monica: Jody! LAUGH

118
00:10:48,532 --> 00:10:50,329
Rachel: You were with Julie?

119
00:10:51,502 --> 00:11:07,283
Monica: Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping. LAUGH

120
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:12,387
Rachel: Oh. Oh my God.

121
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:21,464
Monica: Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me. LAUGH

122
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:34,272
Monica: Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out! LAUGH

123
00:11:34,311 --> 00:11:37,507
Rachel: Oh, please, you wanted to get caught. 

124
00:11:38,382 --> 00:11:39,474
Monica: That is not true!

125
00:11:39,516 --> 00:11:42,314
Rachel: Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?

126
00:11:43,387 --> 00:11:47,483
Monica: Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?

127
00:11:49,293 --> 00:12:15,274
Rachel: Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to _Bloomingdale's_? 

128
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:43,377
Monica:  Hi, Steve. LAUGH

129
00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:49,376
Carol: How did we do?

130
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:52,319
Phoebe: Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.

131
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,314
Ross: I did not freak out.

132
00:12:54,424 --> 00:12:56,403
Carol: Why'd you freak out?

133
00:12:56,403 --> 00:13:00,780
Ross: Because it's breast milk. It's gross.

134
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,264
Carol: My breast milk is gross?

135
00:13:04,268 --> 00:13:05,462
Susan: This should be fun.

136
00:13:08,238 --> 00:13:13,334
Ross: No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just don't think breast milk is for adults.

137
00:13:13,443 --> 00:13:18,345
Chandler: Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.

138
00:13:19,349 --> 00:13:25,253
Carol: Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it. 

139
00:13:25,355 --> 00:13:27,346
Ross:  That would be no.

140
00:13:28,258 --> 00:13:29,253
Come on. Try it.

141
00:13:29,253 --> 00:13:30,248
It's natural.

142
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,452
Phoebe: Come on. It doesn't taste bad.

143
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:36,260
Joey: Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh...

144
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,255
Susan: Cantaloupe juice.

145
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:38,493
Joey: Exactly.

146
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:49,472
Ross:  You've tasted it? You've tasted it.

147
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:53,483
Ross: Oh, you've tasted it.

148
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,319
Susan: You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.

149
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:15,330
Ross: 

150
00:14:40,397 --> 00:14:41,364
Chandler: Howdy.

151
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:50,398
Joey:  Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre.

152
00:14:50,574 --> 00:14:54,304
Chandler: Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.

153
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:02,316
Joey: Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it.  You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day.

154
00:15:04,421 --> 00:15:10,250
Chandler:  What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.

155
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:26,435
Joey: I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best.  I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.

156
00:15:26,543 --> 00:15:35,818
Chandler:  All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?

157
00:15:35,818 --> 00:15:37,285
Joey: Yeah I guess you're right.

158
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:45,455
Chandler: You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.

159
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:47,358
Joey: I'm gonna do it. 

160
00:15:47,358 --> 00:15:53,562
Chandler: All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.

161
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,272
Monica: I don't know what else to say.

162
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,791
Rachel: Well that works out good, because I'm not listening.

163
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,208
Monica: I feel terrible, I really do.

164
00:16:02,312 --> 00:16:06,214
Rachel: Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife?

165
00:16:07,451 --> 00:16:11,409
Monica: Rachel,  say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?

166
00:16:12,422 --> 00:16:13,838
Monica: It's that terrible?

167
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:27,462
Rachel: Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually , but now she's actually stealing you.

168
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:50,977
Monica: Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean,  you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you.

169
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:52,461
Rachel: I love you too. 

170
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:12,210
Phoebe: You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. 

171
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:36,296
Monica: Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?

172
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:41,274
Rachel:  I'd do anything for you, you know that.

173
00:17:41,344 --> 00:17:43,471
Monica: 

174
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:46,348
Phoebe: Wait, wait, wait, wait! 

175
00:18:05,235 --> 00:18:11,239
Joey: Mornin'.  I said, mornin'.

176
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:13,501
Hombre Man: I heard ya.

177
00:18:15,312 --> 00:18:20,240
Store Guy: All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?

178
00:18:25,455 --> 00:18:26,939
Hombre Man: Ready.

179
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,423
Joey: Yeah, I'm ready.

180
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:20,209
Customer: You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!

181
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:25,794
Store Guy: Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?

182
00:19:25,794 --> 00:19:28,342
Hombre Man: I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

183
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,252
Annabelle:  My god, what happened?

184
00:19:32,355 --> 00:19:44,358
Joey: These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?

185
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:46,326
Annabelle: Sure.

186
00:19:58,481 --> 00:19:59,965
Julie: So.

187
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:14,259
Rachel: So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?

188
00:20:14,364 --> 00:20:23,262
Julie: I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.

189
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:26,364
Rachel: Really? Me?

190
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:40,482
Julie: Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't.

191
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:53,393
Rachel: Well, you're not totally paranoid.

192
00:21:01,278 --> 00:21:34,308
Rachel: Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right.

193
00:21:35,512 --> 00:21:41,416
Julie: Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?

194
00:21:41,518 --> 00:21:44,486
Rachel: Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.

195
00:21:44,521 --> 00:21:50,907
Julie: I'd love it too. Shoot, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later.

196
00:21:50,907 --> 00:21:52,488
Rachel: All right, Julie.

197
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,330
Rachel: Bye.  What a manipulative bitch.

198
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:35,403
Ross:  That's not bad. LAUGH
