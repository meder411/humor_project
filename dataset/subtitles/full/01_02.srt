1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:07,224
Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.

2
00:00:07,335 --> 00:00:12,431
Joey: Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?

3
00:00:13,441 --> 00:00:14,373
Phoebe: Oh, yeah!

4
00:00:14,476 --> 00:00:16,376
Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.

5
00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:18,276
Monica: Absolutely.

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:26,377
Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.

7
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:38,355
Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.

8
00:00:40,368 --> 00:00:53,370
Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.

9
00:00:55,383 --> 00:01:03,254
Rachel: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.

10
00:01:07,462 --> 00:01:10,329
Joey: ....Are we still talking about sex?

11
00:02:01,449 --> 00:02:07,347
Ross: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?

12
00:02:07,455 --> 00:02:09,218
Marsha: Well, she has issues.

13
00:02:11,226 --> 00:02:12,215
Ross: Does she.

14
00:02:12,327 --> 00:02:22,227
Marsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! LAUGH

15
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:32,438
Ross: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?

16
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,280
Marsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?

17
00:02:36,351 --> 00:02:37,318
Ross:  No. No.

18
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:38,285
Marsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!

19
00:02:38,386 --> 00:02:42,378
Ross: Okay, okay, yes, it is.  How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.

20
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,440
Can I stay?

21
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,390
No.

22
00:02:59,307 --> 00:02:59,870
Ross:Hi. LAUGH

23
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,433
Carol: So.

24
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,866
Is this a bad time? LAUGH

25
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:13,444
No, it's the Stone Age.

26
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:19,455
Ross: You look great. I, uh... I hate that.

27
00:03:20,428 --> 00:03:24,228
Carol: Sorry. You look good too.

28
00:03:24,332 --> 00:03:34,837
Ross: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... LAUGH

29
00:03:34,837 --> 00:03:36,333
Carol: A lesbian?

30
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:41,476
Ross: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?

31
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,847
Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-

32
00:03:44,847 --> 00:03:47,344
Ross: Why- why are you here, Carol?

33
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,387
Carol: I'm pregnant.

34
00:03:50,387 --> 00:03:51,484
Ross: Pregnant?!

35
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,300
She didn't leave

36
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,200
in such a hurry after all.

37
00:04:03,238 --> 00:04:07,436
Chandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.

38
00:04:10,411 --> 00:04:13,346
Phoebe:...Then I've already seen this one! LAUGH

39
00:04:14,415 --> 00:04:16,315
Monica:  Are you through with that?

40
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:19,318
Joey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.

41
00:04:20,421 --> 00:04:22,355
Monica: Whose little ball of paper is this?!

42
00:04:22,423 --> 00:04:29,453
Chandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead.

43
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:36,326
Phoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that-  -but, it's fine!

44
00:04:37,238 --> 00:04:40,434
Monica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.

45
00:04:40,475 --> 00:04:44,467
Chandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.

46
00:04:46,447 --> 00:04:48,347
Relax, you do this every time.

47
00:04:48,347 --> 00:04:50,247
The place looks great.

48
00:04:50,285 --> 00:04:51,866
You got a lasagna here

49
00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:55,388
that looks good enough to avoid touching.

50
00:04:58,493 --> 00:05:10,428
Phoebe: Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.

51
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:18,344
Joey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.

52
00:05:18,446 --> 00:05:28,320
Monica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.

53
00:05:32,226 --> 00:05:33,323
Monica: What? LAUGH

54
00:05:33,323 --> 00:05:34,420
Chandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!

55
00:05:39,434 --> 00:05:41,334
Rachel: Has anybody seen my engagement ring? LAUGH

56
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:43,234
Phoebe: Yeah, it's beautiful.

57
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:51,268
Rachel: Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... 

58
00:05:51,346 --> 00:05:53,280
Phoebe: No, look, don't touch that!

59
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:12,189
Rachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... LAUGH

60
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:14,424
Monica: Easy Rach, we'll find it.  Won't we!

61
00:06:16,204 --> 00:06:17,353
Look, it's gonna be okay.

62
00:06:17,353 --> 00:06:21,236
You'll give it back and we'll eat ice cream.

63
00:06:21,236 --> 00:06:23,232
Okay. It's a pear-shaped diamond--

64
00:06:23,344 --> 00:06:24,840
Any diamond ring we find,

65
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,336
we'll run it by you.

66
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:30,428
Joey: Alright, when'd'ya have it on last? LAUGH

67
00:06:30,428 --> 00:06:32,407
Phoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it!

68
00:06:35,256 --> 00:06:37,450
Chandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...

69
00:06:39,427 --> 00:06:45,322
Rachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...

70
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:47,230
Chandler: ...Dinah?

71
00:06:50,238 --> 00:06:51,785
Rachel:  Ohhhhh, don't be mad...

72
00:06:51,785 --> 00:06:53,332
Monica: You didn't.

73
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:55,454
Rachel: Oh, I am sorry...

74
00:06:55,454 --> 00:06:57,467
Monica: I gave you one job! 

75
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,406
Rachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!

76
00:07:02,383 --> 00:07:07,285
Chandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...

77
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,221
Monica:  I just... can't do it.

78
00:07:12,326 --> 00:07:16,194
Chandler: Boys? We're going in.

79
00:07:24,338 --> 00:07:25,327
Ross: .....Hi. LAUGH

80
00:07:27,341 --> 00:07:28,888
Monica: Wow. That is not a happy hi. LAUGH

81
00:07:28,888 --> 00:07:30,435
Ross: Carol's pregnant.

82
00:07:31,212 --> 00:07:32,304
Phoebe:  Ooh! I found it!

83
00:07:34,415 --> 00:07:37,441
Monica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-... LAUGH

84
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:45,256
Ross: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. LAUGH

85
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,320
Chandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?

86
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:54,265
Rachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?

87
00:07:54,368 --> 00:08:04,258
Ross: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.

88
00:08:04,258 --> 00:08:06,306
Phoebe: She is so great! I miss her.

89
00:08:11,385 --> 00:08:13,433
Monica: What does she mean by 'involved'?

90
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:15,481
Chandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.

91
00:08:18,192 --> 00:08:19,420
And the most enjoyable. LAUGH

92
00:08:21,395 --> 00:08:23,386
Phoebe, say something.

93
00:08:23,498 --> 00:08:29,200
Ross: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.

94
00:08:29,303 --> 00:08:34,203
Remember when life was simpler and she was just a lesbian?

95
00:08:35,243 --> 00:08:37,336
Those were the days.

96
00:08:38,212 --> 00:08:39,810
Rachel: So what are you gonna do?

97
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:45,407
Ross: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.

98
00:08:55,429 --> 00:08:57,454
Joey: .....Well, this is still ruined, right? LAUGH

99
00:09:03,348 --> 00:09:11,371
Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you.  Mmm! What's that curry taste?

100
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:13,288
Monica: Curry.

101
00:09:17,395 --> 00:09:20,387
Ross: I- I think they're great! I, I really do.

102
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:24,191
Mr. Geller:  Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?

103
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:25,883
Mrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him.

104
00:09:25,883 --> 00:09:27,464
Ross: Aw, Mom...

105
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:30,265
Monica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?

106
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:39,212
Mrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-

107
00:09:39,284 --> 00:09:41,735
Monica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.

108
00:09:41,735 --> 00:09:44,186
Mrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that... 

109
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:49,756
Monica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? LAUGH

110
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,320
Ross: Yeah. 

111
00:09:51,396 --> 00:09:55,298
Mrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. LAUGH

112
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:58,335
We were going to have lasagna.

113
00:09:58,403 --> 00:09:59,899
I love lasagna.

114
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,395
We're not having it.

115
00:10:02,407 --> 00:10:05,399
Then why bring it up? He latches on. LAUGH

116
00:10:08,212 --> 00:10:17,317
Monica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.

117
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:26,354
Mrs. Geller: What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well. LAUGH

118
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:31,428
Mr. Geller: I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!

119
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:38,375
Mrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... LAUGH

120
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:42,863
Monica: What's that supposed to mean?

121
00:10:42,863 --> 00:10:45,978
Mrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression.

122
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,474
Monica: No it's not.

123
00:10:48,252 --> 00:11:01,489
Mr. Geller: Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...

124
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:18,441
Mr. Geller: Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.

125
00:11:20,218 --> 00:11:21,714
They're happy with what

126
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:25,245
they have, content like cows. LAUGH

127
00:11:27,225 --> 00:11:28,351
Cows, Dad?

128
00:11:29,227 --> 00:11:31,422
She knows how much I love cows.

129
00:11:34,332 --> 00:11:45,373
Mr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. LAUGH

130
00:11:45,373 --> 00:11:47,472
Thank you, Daddy.

131
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:52,245
Oh, so this does work.

132
00:11:55,253 --> 00:12:03,392
Monica:  No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? LAUGH

133
00:12:07,198 --> 00:12:33,313
Ross:  Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. LAUGH

134
00:12:37,328 --> 00:12:38,522
Mrs. Geller:  And you knew about this?!

135
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:48,431
Joey: Your folks are really that bad, huh?

136
00:12:50,241 --> 00:13:00,316
Ross: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. LAUGH

137
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:08,315
Monica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could-  -I'd want yours. LAUGH

138
00:13:10,294 --> 00:13:11,283
Ross: Must pee. 

139
00:13:13,231 --> 00:13:15,199
Phoebe: Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.

140
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:16,228
Rachel: You're twins?

141
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:20,293
Phoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.

142
00:13:20,404 --> 00:13:21,854
Chandler: What does she do?

143
00:13:21,854 --> 00:13:23,304
Phoebe: She's a waitress. LAUGH

144
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:25,875
Identical?

145
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,308
People say we look alike.

146
00:13:27,411 --> 00:13:28,503
But I don't see it.

147
00:13:30,214 --> 00:13:33,206
Rachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. 

148
00:13:33,317 --> 00:13:36,251
Monica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.

149
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,418
Chandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.

150
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,219
Rachel: The lights, please.. LAUGH

151
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:55,237
Ross: ...How long was I in there? LAUGH

152
00:13:56,274 --> 00:13:58,322
Rachel: I'm just cleaning up.

153
00:13:58,322 --> 00:14:00,370
Ross: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?

00:14:02,313 --> 00:14:04,178
Rachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! 

155
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:15,188
Ross: Anyway.. um..  So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow? LAUGH

156
00:14:15,326 --> 00:14:16,418
Rachel: Oh.. a little..

00:14:18,396 --> 00:14:20,193
Rachel: A lot.

158
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:27,296
Rachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?

159
00:14:28,306 --> 00:14:54,328
Ross: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN... LAUGH

160
00:14:56,334 --> 00:15:01,354
Rachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? LAUGH

161
00:15:01,354 --> 00:15:03,271
Ross: Got me.

162
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,288
Rachel: Remember when we were in high school together? LAUGH

163
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:06,368
Ross: Yeah.

164
00:15:07,178 --> 00:15:18,250
Rachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it?  ..Ross? LAUGH

165
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,279
Ross: Yes, yes! LAUGH

166
00:15:22,193 --> 00:15:25,424
Rachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..

Ross: Me either... LAUGH

168
00:15:51,255 --> 00:15:57,258
Ross:  Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.

Carol: Ross, you remember Susan.

171
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:03,291
Ross: How could I forget?

172
00:16:04,402 --> 00:16:12,276
Ross:  Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? LAUGH

Carol: Dr. Oberman.

174
00:16:13,356 --> 00:16:14,402
Ross: ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-

175
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:16,174
Susan: She.

176

Rachel:  Are you sure?

184
00:17:05,156 --> 00:17:08,289
Barry: Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

185
00:17:12,203 --> 00:17:13,397
Barry: So, how ya doin? LAUGH

186
00:17:15,172 --> 00:17:21,291

Ross: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?

194
00:18:14,811 --> 00:18:16,358
Carol: Marlon-

195
00:18:17,168 --> 00:18:19,295
Carol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.

196
00:18:21,372 --> 00:18:23,203
Ross: ...As in Mouse?

199
00:18:36,387 --> 00:18:37,786
Carol: Julia..

200
00:18:37,786 --> 00:18:39,185
Susan: We agreed on Minnie.

201
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:47,387
Ross: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?

202
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:57,400
Barry: Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?

203
00:18:58,209 --> 00:19:02,208
Rachel: Oh, not much. I-I got a job.

204
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:03,271

Barry: No!  I went with Mindy.

211
00:19:30,174 --> 00:19:33,402
Rachel: Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!

212
00:19:34,211 --> 00:19:37,180
Barry: Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now.

213
00:19:41,318 --> 00:19:43,286
Rachel: Oh! Well, um..  You've got plugs!

214
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,289
Barry: Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.

215
00:19:46,423 --> 00:19:52,285
Rachel: And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!

216
00:19:52,329 --> 00:20:00,301
Barry: Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you.

217
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:02,331
Rachel: Okay..

218
00:20:03,307 --> 00:20:10,303
Barry: See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist.

219
00:20:12,316 --> 00:20:24,874
Barry: You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit.

220
00:20:24,874 --> 00:20:25,420
Rachel: What?

221
00:20:25,462 --> 00:20:27,327
Robbie: Me. 

222
00:20:29,466 --> 00:20:54,390
Rachel: Anyway, um,  I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.

223
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:57,452
Barry: Well, thank you for giving it back.

224
00:21:00,231 --> 00:21:01,289
Robbie: Hello?!

225
00:21:05,202 --> 00:21:06,766
Susan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?

226
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:11,374
Ross: Helen Geller? I don't think so.

227
00:21:11,374 --> 00:21:13,308
Carol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.

228
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,923
Ross: Thank you!

229
00:21:14,923 --> 00:21:16,436
Carol: No, I mean it's not Geller.

230
00:21:17,414 --> 00:21:19,245
Ross: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?

231
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:24,410
Carol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.

232
00:21:26,257 --> 00:21:28,451
Ross: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?

233
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,352
Susan: It's my baby too.

234
00:21:30,427 --> 00:21:33,453
Ross: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.

235
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:39,265
Susan: Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!

236
00:21:40,237 --> 00:21:41,852
Carol: All right, you two, stop it!

237
00:21:41,852 --> 00:21:43,467
Ross: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.

238
00:21:44,241 --> 00:21:49,439
Carol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.

239
00:21:50,247 --> 00:21:53,477
Ross: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.

240
00:21:54,251 --> 00:22:01,219
Susan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!

241
00:22:01,292 --> 00:22:11,232
Ross: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-

242
00:22:11,335 --> 00:22:14,236
Dr. Oberman:  Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?

243
00:22:14,305 --> 00:22:16,239
All: Yeah. Yeah. A little.

244
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:24,794
Dr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing.  Uh, lie back..

245
00:22:24,794 --> 00:22:31,216
Ross: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.

246
00:22:42,232 --> 00:22:43,329
Ross: Oh my God.

247
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:44,426
Susan: Look at that.

248
00:22:44,468 --> 00:22:46,333
Carol: I know.

249
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,539
Ross: Well? Isn't that amazing?

250
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:04,377
Joey: What are we supposed to be seeing here?

251
00:23:05,489 --> 00:23:10,323
Chandler: I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.

252
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:19,431
Phoebe: You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.

253
00:23:20,337 --> 00:23:22,498
Ross: Then don't do that, alright?

254
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:27,433
Ross: Monica. Whaddya think?

255
00:23:30,414 --> 00:23:31,426
Ross: Wh- are you welling up?

256
00:23:31,426 --> 00:23:32,438
Monica: No.

257
00:23:33,217 --> 00:23:34,764
Ross: You are, you're welling up.

258
00:23:34,764 --> 00:23:36,311
Monica: Am not!

259
00:23:36,353 --> 00:23:37,786
Ross: You're gonna be an aunt.

260
00:23:37,786 --> 00:23:39,219
Monica:  Oh shut up!

261
00:23:40,424 --> 00:24:17,282
Rachel:  Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now. LAUGH
