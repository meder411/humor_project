1
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:15,270
MONICA: So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon.

2
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,372
MONICA: What? LAUGH

3
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:20,441
ROSS: Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?

4
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,387
MONICA: You wanna be in charge of the food committee?

5
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:25,447
ROSS: Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?

6
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:30,250
JOEY: Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun? LAUGH

7
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:37,370
PHOEBE: Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are. LAUGH

8
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:42,499
MONICA: Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want.

9
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:53,284
MONICA: Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See  honk honk. LAUGH

10
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,583
CHANDLER: Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns.

11
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,305
ROSS: I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come.

12
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:51,502
MONICA: Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper.

13
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:53,996
JOEY: Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper.

14
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:55,480
PHOEBE: Why not her?

15
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,476
JOEY: Cause she uh, she steals stuff.

16
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:06,417
CHANDLER: Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back. LAUGH

17
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,455
MONICA: Joey that is horriable. LAUGH

18
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:17,231
JOEY: Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared.

19
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,239
PHOEBE: I'm sorry, I didn't know. LAUGH

20
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,267
JOEY: I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok.

21
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,876
ROSS: Hi honey, how did it go?

22
00:02:26,876 --> 00:02:28,474
RACHEL: Agh, it was the graduation from hell.

23
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:32,479
CHANDLER: Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship. LAUGH

24
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:43,456
RACHEL: Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica. LAUGH

25
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,410
MONICA: So what happened?

26
00:02:45,410 --> 00:03:07,343
RACHEL: My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours. LAUGH

27
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,315
PHOEBE: Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents. LAUGH

28
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,790
MONICA: Well, how bout just her mom?

29
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,223
CHANDLER: Why her mom?

30
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,420
MONICA: Cause I already invited her. LAUGH

31
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,463
PHOEBE: Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?

32
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:26,237
JOEY: Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals. LAUGH

33
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,437
So does her roommate.

34
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,481
PHOEBE: Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?

35
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:46,350
MONICA: Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan. LAUGH

36
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,284
CHANDLER: Excuse me?

37
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,328
MONICA: It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.

38
00:03:50,328 --> 00:03:55,460
JOEY: Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo. LAUGH

39
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:09,313
MONICA:  Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here? LAUGH

40
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,315
MR. GREENE: What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?

41
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:21,450
MONICA: No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye.

42
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,355
MR. GREENE: Ohhh, you're having a parteee. LAUGH

43
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:31,902
MONICA: No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey.

44
00:04:31,902 --> 00:04:40,378
MR. GREENE: I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it? LAUGH

45
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:44,348
CHANDLER: This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir? LAUGH

46
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,244
MRS. GREENE: Hi Monica.

47
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,449
MONICA: Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.

48
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:58,396
CHANDLER: So, basically just a Chinese guy. LAUGH

49
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:04,293
JOEY: Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.

50
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:10,197
MR. GREENE: Alright, that sounds like a two person job. LAUGH

51
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,437
MRS. GREENE: Well, my goodness, what was that?

52
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:18,410
MONICA: Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet.

53
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,469
MRS. GREENE: You thought I was Rachel?

54
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:22,420
CHANDLER: Yes because uh, you look so young.

55
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:27,220
PHOEBE: And because you're both, you know, white women. LAUGH

56
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:33,323
MRS. GREENE: Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?

57
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,350
CHANDLER: NO! No, I'll take that for ya. LAUGH

58
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,363
MRS. GREENE: Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you. 

59
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,894
It all looks so nice.

60
00:05:45,894 --> 00:05:48,345
So festive. All the balloons. LAUGH

61
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,962
Oh, the funniest thing happened

62
00:05:49,962 --> 00:05:51,543
to me on the way here.

63
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,365
I was driving--

64
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:54,445
That's great!

65
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,872
I can't wait to hear it, LAUGH

66
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:02,187

RACHEL: It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just...
