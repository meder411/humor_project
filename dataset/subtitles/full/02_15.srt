00:00:07,195 --> 00:00:11,325
CHANDLER: Alright, alright, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes. LAUGH

3
00:00:13,335 --> 00:00:15,303
JOEY: Alright open your eyes. 

4
00:00:20,308 --> 00:00:23,436
CHANDLER: Sweet mother of all that is good and pure. LAUGH

5
00:00:24,412 --> 00:00:26,829
JOEY: Huh? _Days of our Lives_ picked up my option.

6
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:29,246
CHANDLER: Congratulations!

7
00:00:29,451 --> 00:00:34,251

8
00:00:36,224 --> 00:00:37,350
CHANDLER: So uh, which one is mine?

9
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:39,376
JOEY: Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want.  Not that one.

10
00:00:39,376 --> 00:00:41,327
Whichever one you want!

11
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,364
Not that one. LAUGH

12
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:50,429
Oh, yes!

13
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,265
JOEY:  Ohh yeah, that's the stuff. LAUGH

14
00:00:56,444 --> 00:00:58,344
Do we dare?

15
00:00:58,446 --> 00:01:00,209
We dare.

16
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:59,368
 LAUGH

17
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:02,893
PHOEBE: I can't believe two cows made the ultimate sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.

18
00:02:02,893 --> 00:02:04,377
in the wild.

19
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,276
CHANDLER: Well they were chair-shaped cows. They never would have survived in the wild.

20
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:15,219
ALL: Woah! LAUGH

21
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,424
MONICA: Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen, doesn't she?

22
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:19,843
RACHEL: Hi you guys.

23
00:02:19,843 --> 00:02:21,293
Hey, you.

27
00:02:34,342 --> 00:02:36,435

MONICA: Tonight you're supposed to waitress for me, my catering thing, any of those words trigger anything for you? LAUGH

38
00:03:19,187 --> 00:03:20,683
RACHEL: God, oh God Monica, I forgot. This is our first date.

39
00:03:20,683 --> 00:03:22,179

42
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:27,461
RACHEL: Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe.

43
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:32,199
MONICA: Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing. LAUGH

44
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,427
I can be a waitress. Watch this.

45
00:03:35,203 --> 00:03:37,398
Give me two number ones, 86 the bacon.

46
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:39,321
One Adam and Eve on a raft

47
00:03:39,321 --> 00:03:40,436
and wreck them!

48
00:03:54,422 --> 00:03:56,356
 LAUGH

49
00:03:58,226 --> 00:03:59,739
PHOEBE: It's James Bond.

50
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,792
MONICA: Sorry we're late.

51
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:04,288
I was told she was. LAUGH

52
00:04:04,365 --> 00:04:06,196
Dr. Burke, it's me.

00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:17,403
MONICA: Dr. Burke, it, it's me. LAUGH

54

56
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:29,304
How you been? LAUGH

57
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:30,419
DR. BURKE: Hi Phoebe, nice to meet you.  So, how ya been?

58
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:35,388
MONICA: I've been great, just great. How have you been? 

59
00:04:35,496 --> 00:04:37,225
DR. BURKE: Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt.

60
00:04:37,298 --> 00:04:44,235
MONICA: The head tilt?

61
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:45,499
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:47,287
It's fine.

63
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,333
Believe me, I do it too.

64
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:50,422
I always answer with the

65
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:52,435
''I'm okay'' head bob. ''I'm okay.'' LAUGH

66
00:04:53,314 --> 00:04:54,781
''You're sure?''

67
00:04:54,781 --> 00:04:56,248
''Yeah, I'm fine.''

68
00:04:56,317 --> 00:04:57,864
I gotta set up the music.

69
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,411
I got a new CD changer.

70
00:04:59,454 --> 00:05:01,319
The divorce only left

71
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:03,184
me with four CDs to change.

72
00:05:03,258 --> 00:05:04,384
That's too bad.

73
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,192
I'll survive.

74
00:05:10,365 --> 00:05:14,267
Two larges, extra cheese on both. LAUGH

75
00:05:14,302 --> 00:05:18,399
But listen don't ring the buzzer for 1 9.

76
00:05:19,207 --> 00:05:21,368
Ring 20. Geller/Greene.

77
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:25,168
They'll let you in, okay?

78
00:05:27,181 --> 00:05:28,728
If you buzz our door,

79
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,275
there's no tip for you. LAUGH

80
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:33,187
Okay, thanks.

81
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:36,385
Pizza's on the way.

82
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:38,381
I told you we wouldn't have to get up.

83
00:05:39,294 --> 00:05:41,319
What if we have to pee? LAUGH

84
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:47,199
I'll cancel the sodas.

85
00:05:50,438 --> 00:05:51,467
Get out there. LAUGH

86
00:05:51,467 --> 00:05:52,496
It's your party!

87
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:54,725
They're so dull!

88
00:05:54,725 --> 00:05:56,209
They're all ophthalmologists.

89
00:05:56,444 --> 00:05:58,395
You're an ophthalmologist.

90
00:05:58,395 --> 00:06:00,346
That's what my parents wanted.

91
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:03,145
I wanted to be a sheriff.

92
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:04,898
That's funny. Cadillac, cataract.

93
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,445
I get it.

94
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:09,281
No! You stay out there! LAUGH

95
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:10,788
You see?

96
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:11,385
I tell you what.

97
00:06:12,193 --> 00:06:14,673
DR. BURKE: See.

00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:17,153

99
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:23,398
MONICA: Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency.

100
00:06:24,272 --> 00:06:26,206
Watch this.

101
00:06:26,374 --> 00:06:29,172
Who needs glasses?

102
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,866
DR. BURKE: OK. You better. Oh God, here we go. Hey wanna see 'em go nuts? Watch this. LAUGH

103
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:38,316
PHOEBE: You are so smitten.

104
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:44,341
MONICA: I am not. LAUGH

105
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:45,291
Dr. Burke?

106
00:06:46,194 --> 00:06:50,220
PHOEBE: Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out. LAUGH

107
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,293
MONICA: Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up.

108
00:06:54,402 --> 00:06:58,202
PHOEBE: So. You two are totally into each other.

109
00:06:58,306 --> 00:07:01,139
MONICA: Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me.

110
00:07:01,242 --> 00:07:06,371
PHOEBE: OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?

111
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:09,260
MONICA: Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment. LAUGH

112
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:15,345
PHOEBE: Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked? LAUGH

113
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,725
They're picking teams to play

114
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:22,159
''Guess my prescription.'' Help me!

115
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:32,161
 LAUGH

116
00:07:32,373 --> 00:07:34,386
RACHEL: C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow. LAUGH

117
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:41,371
ROSS: I told you there was going to be sub-titles.

118
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,282
RACHEL: I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date.

119
00:07:54,195 --> 00:07:58,393
RACHEL: Monica. LAUGH

120
00:07:58,433 --> 00:08:00,230
ROSS: It would really help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout out my sister's name.

121
00:08:01,335 --> 00:08:02,734
ROSS: Oh.

122
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:04,133
RACHEL: Monica.

123
00:08:34,402 --> 00:08:36,267
ROSS: Mon. LAUGH

124
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,768
ROSS: What, what.

125
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:43,243
down to my butt it was, like,

126
00:08:43,243 --> 00:08:45,177
''Whoa! Ross's hands are on my butt!'' LAUGH

127
00:08:46,414 --> 00:08:49,178
And that's funny. Why?

128
00:08:50,318 --> 00:08:52,286
Well, it's not. LAUGH

129
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,379
ROSS: And that's, that's funny why?

130
00:08:54,422 --> 00:08:58,324
I mean, it's you. You know, it's us.

131
00:08:58,426 --> 00:09:00,343
We're crossing that line.

132
00:09:00,343 --> 00:09:02,260
It's sort of a big thing.

133
00:09:02,363 --> 00:09:07,231
RACHEL: Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing. LAUGH

134
00:09:18,346 --> 00:09:21,338
RACHEL: OK. 

135
00:09:21,382 --> 00:09:23,179
ROSS: OK, my hands were no where near your butt. LAUGH

136
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:24,815
I was thinking about

137
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,379
the last time they were there.

138
00:09:27,154 --> 00:09:29,247
I'm sorry. Look! I promise.

139
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,786
I won't laugh anymore.

140
00:09:30,786 --> 00:09:32,282
Put your hands back.

141
00:09:32,393 --> 00:09:35,260
No, see, now I can't.

142
00:09:36,297 --> 00:09:38,276
I'm feeling too self-conscious.

143
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:40,255
Touch my butt.

144
00:09:41,202 --> 00:09:42,749
Just one cheek.

145
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,296
The moment's gone. LAUGH

146
00:09:44,405 --> 00:09:45,901
I'll back up into your hands.

147
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:47,397
That's romantic.

148
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:48,703
-Touch it.

149
00:09:48,703 --> 00:09:49,197
-No.

150
00:09:49,277 --> 00:09:50,227
-Come on, squeeze it.

151
00:09:50,227 --> 00:09:51,177
-No!

152
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:51,773
-Rub it?

153
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:52,267
-No.

154
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,847
Oh, come on!

155
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:55,314
Would you just grab my ass?

156
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,837
Wow! Look at that! LAUGH

157
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:07,689


158
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:12,425
its expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax.

159
00:10:14,402 --> 00:10:17,303
JOEY: Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax. LAUGH

160
00:10:28,249 --> 00:10:31,309
CHANDLER and JOEY: Hey. LAUGH

161
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:33,410
JOEY: What're you doin' here? Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?

162
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:38,323
We gotta set the clock on this. LAUGH

163
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,328
So how'd it go?

164
00:10:42,363 --> 00:10:44,342
CHANDLER: So how'd it go?

165
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:49,327
fooling around with a girl and she started laughing?

166
00:10:49,537 --> 00:10:57,276
ROSS: Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'? LAUGH

167
00:11:00,214 --> 00:11:01,374
CHANDLER: Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.

168
00:11:01,415 --> 00:11:04,213
It could have been worse.

169
00:11:04,285 --> 00:11:06,276
I could have been naked. LAUGH

170
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:14,192
I've wanted this since 9th grade.

171
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:20,199

00:15:41,428 --> 00:15:43,908
He'll be an inspiration to men who are

almost retired all over the world. LAUGH

243
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:49,300

250
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,213

PHOEBE: Oh you are so lucky.

256
00:16:17,197 --> 00:16:18,795
Australopithecus isn't supposed LAUGH

257
00:16:18,795 --> 00:16:20,393
to be in that display.

258
00:16:22,403 --> 00:16:24,837
No, Homo habilis was erect.

259
00:16:24,837 --> 00:16:27,271
Australopithecus was never fully erect.

260
00:16:27,374 --> 00:16:29,365
Well, maybe he was nervous.

261
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:37,850
Oh, look!

262
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,283
I can't believe this!

263
00:16:39,386 --> 00:16:41,382
Homo habilis can't use tools yet,

264
00:16:41,382 --> 00:16:43,378
and he has clay pots?

265
00:16:44,191 --> 00:16:45,687
Why don't they just

266
00:16:45,687 --> 00:16:47,183
give him a microwave?

267
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:48,790
Clearly he'd have no place

268
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,286
to plug it in.

269
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,491
Sorry. LAUGH

270
00:16:56,303 --> 00:16:58,282
I'm sorry this is taking so long.

It's longer than I expected.

272
00:17:00,374 --> 00:17:01,369
We will have dinner.

273
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:02,364

00:17:38,373 --> 00:17:42,393
MONICA: I thought she just had one.

284
00:17:42,393 --> 00:17:44,372
and everything. Here.

285
00:17:45,185 --> 00:17:46,800
He told me he liked me

286
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,415
better than his other grandpa.

287
00:17:49,189 --> 00:17:51,185
In all fairness, his other

288
00:17:51,185 --> 00:17:53,181
grandpa's a drunk, but still.... LAUGH

289
00:17:55,295 --> 00:17:57,286
You're a grandpa.

Yeah.

291
00:18:06,273 --> 00:18:08,264

DR. BURKE: Yeah. Are we nuts here? LAUGH

294
00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:22,154
MONICA: I don't know, maybe. I mean I'm dating a man who's pool I once peed in.

295
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:24,669
Hell, I'm a whole ''person

297
00:18:28,262 --> 00:18:30,162
DR. BURKE: I didn't need to know that. I guess 21 years is a lot. I mean, hell, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you.

298
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:33,461

DR. BURKE: Yeah, it sure does. 

304
00:19:16,376 --> 00:19:19,436
MONICA: Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?

305
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:22,343
DR. BURKE: No, no, there's no rush or anything.
