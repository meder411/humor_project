00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,388
be solved by ''happy keys.'' LAUGH

4
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:27,254
I feel better when someone

shakes jagged metal in my face.

6
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,262

ROSS: Come on, don't do this.

18
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,346
You're just unemployed. LAUGH

20
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:47,364
CHANDLER: Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat. LAUGH

21
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,317

00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:10,219
ROSS: Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.

29
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:14,259
MONICA: No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special.

30
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:19,457
ROSS: And that's what's gonna kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi. LAUGH

31
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:27,364

35
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:38,245

44
00:04:05,809 --> 00:04:10,339
CHANDLER: I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window. LAUGH

45
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:17,320
ROSS: Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag.

46
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,775
JOEY: Hat, milk, got it.

00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:52,483

64
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:49,258

193
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:12,231
PHOEBE: Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.

RACHEL: Do you?

195
00:20:13,894 --> 00:20:41,361

196
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:52,512
RACHEL: Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!

197
00:20:54,519 --> 00:21:04,317
PHOEBE: It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.

00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:14,364
PHOEBE: Really? From who?

200
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:22,269
RACHEL: Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.

201
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:34,857
KID: Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency.

202
00:21:34,857 --> 00:21:37,825

207
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:05,313

208
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:10,316
MONICA: Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?

209
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:15,283
ROSS: Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb?

210
00:22:15,283 --> 00:22:20,261
MONICA: No. But I remember people telling me about it.

211
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,291
ROSS: I hope Ben has a little sister.

212
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:28,246
MONICA: Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.

213
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:35,250
ROSS: I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?

214
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,446
MONICA: That was you?

215
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,283

220
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:33,467
JOEY: Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today.

221
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:49,382
ROSS: Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?

222
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:55,560
CHANDLER: You, you are gonna love this.

223
