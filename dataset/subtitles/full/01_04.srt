00:00:03,154 --> 00:00:04,348
Monica: Alright. Phoebe?

2
00:00:04,455 --> 00:00:15,161
Phoebe: Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs! LAUGH

3
00:00:16,301 --> 00:00:21,193
Ross: Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you? LAUGH

4
00:00:21,306 --> 00:00:26,266
Chandler: Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.

5
00:00:26,377 --> 00:00:31,371
Rachel: See, there's always one guy. LAUGH

6
00:00:33,318 --> 00:00:34,410
All: Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy.

7
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,483
Monica: Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?

8
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:40,213
Joey: Probably kill myself!

9
00:00:41,326 --> 00:00:42,384
Monica: ..Excuse me?

10
00:00:42,427 --> 00:00:46,329
Joey: Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live! LAUGH

11
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:51,427
Ross: Joey, uh- OMnipotent.

12
00:00:52,337 --> 00:01:00,275
Joey: You _are_? Ross, I'm sorry.. LAUGH

13
00:01:50,395 --> 00:01:52,329
Monica: How does she do that? LAUGH

14
00:01:52,397 --> 00:01:55,195
Ross: I cannot sleep in a public place. LAUGH

15
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:56,362
Libraries, airplanes,

16
00:01:56,362 --> 00:01:57,425
movie theaters....

17
00:01:58,236 --> 00:02:00,170
You slept at the Grand Canyon.

18
00:02:00,238 --> 00:02:02,234
Hello, Mom and Dad never took us

19
00:02:02,234 --> 00:02:04,230
to the Grand Canyon.

20
00:02:05,243 --> 00:02:06,306
Mom and Dad took us

21
00:02:06,306 --> 00:02:07,369
to the Grand Canyon? LAUGH

22
00:02:09,147 --> 00:02:13,374
Monica: Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.

23
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,367
Phoebe:  Oh! What what what! ...Hi. LAUGH

24
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:20,380
Ross: It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.

25
00:02:21,192 --> 00:02:22,181
Monica: What's going on with you?

26
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,757
Phoebe: I got no sleep last night!

27
00:02:24,757 --> 00:02:42,210
Phoebe: My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are! LAUGH

28
00:02:43,181 --> 00:02:44,728
Monica: Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight. LAUGH

29
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:46,275
Phoebe: Thanks.

30
00:02:46,384 --> 00:02:52,486
Joey: ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.

31
00:02:53,224 --> 00:02:56,216
Chandler: You got waaaay too much free time.

32
00:02:56,327 --> 00:03:03,357
Joey:  Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.

33
00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:05,648
Chandler: Happy birthday, pal!

34
00:03:05,648 --> 00:03:07,161
Joey: We love you, man. 

35
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,333
Ross: Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.

36
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,808
Joey: So?

37
00:03:12,808 --> 00:03:17,439
Ross: So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?

38
00:03:18,182 --> 00:03:21,378
Chandler: Well, aren't we Mr. "The glass is half empty."

39
00:03:22,153 --> 00:03:26,145
Ross: Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?

40
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,220
Monica: Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.

41
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,250
Joey: What's wrong with the twentieth?

42
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:35,162
Chandler: Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?

43
00:03:35,266 --> 00:04:01,347
Ross: Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship.  Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.

44
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,318
Joey: The hell with hockey, let's all do that!

45
00:04:07,231 --> 00:04:13,330
Chandler:  Huh? Huh? Huh?

46
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:14,804
Ross: What are you doing?

47
00:04:14,804 --> 00:04:16,237
Chandler:  I have no idea.

48
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,740
Joey: C'mon, Ross!

49
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:22,709
Ross: Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?

50
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:24,239
Chandler: You got it.

51
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:32,253
Rachel: Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!

52
00:04:33,157 --> 00:04:39,385
Phoebe: I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.

53
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,298
Monica: Wow, you worked in a mine?

54
00:04:43,298 --> 00:04:45,397
Phoebe: I worked in a _Dairy Queen_, why?

55
00:04:48,406 --> 00:05:07,249
Rachel: God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totallynot worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.

56
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,218
Chandler:  Oh, this is not that bad.

57
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:13,230
Joey: Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.

58
00:05:13,264 --> 00:05:16,164
Ross: You can totally, totally live on this.

59
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:18,327
Monica: Yeah, yeah.

60
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:20,365
Ross: Oh, by the way, great service tonight.

61
00:05:20,365 --> 00:05:22,361
All: Oh! Yeah!

62
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:42,155
Guys: Hockey! 

63
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:45,352
Leslie:  Rachel?

64
00:05:46,364 --> 00:05:49,162
Rachel: Oh my God! (Rachel, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne all scream and hug each other.

65
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:58,170
Monica:  I swear I've seen birds do this on _Wild Kingdom_.

66
00:05:58,209 --> 00:05:59,403
Rachel: What are you guys doing here?

67
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:05,342
Kiki: Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true!

68
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:12,219
Joanne: Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play.

69
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:17,319
Rachel:  Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!

70
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:21,262
Leslie: I know. I know! I'm a duplex.

71
00:06:21,365 --> 00:06:24,300
Kiki, you look phenomenal. I mean,

72
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,235
you've lost, like, a ton of weight.

73
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:31,790
And you should really, really-- It's time to stop,

74
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,439
you look perfect.

75
00:06:34,178 --> 00:06:35,338
Rachel:  So what's going on with you?

76
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:39,439
Joanne: Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm? 

77
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:45,452
Kiki: And while we're on the subject of news.. 

78
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,355
Phoebe: 

79
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,267
Chandler: ...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! 

80
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,339
Joey: Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass! 

81
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:08,238
Chandler: We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.

82
00:07:08,312 --> 00:07:26,254
Ross: Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we-  Sorry. Sorry.

83
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:28,293
Joey: What?

84
00:07:28,293 --> 00:07:29,322
Ross: Peach pit.

85
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:32,125
Chandler: Yes, Bunny?

86
00:07:32,336 --> 00:07:36,136
Ross:  Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-

87
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,236
Joey: -Peaches?

88
00:07:38,236 --> 00:07:40,232
Ross: Actually, nectarines, but basically...

89
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:42,142
Chandler:  Could've been a peach.

90
00:07:42,246 --> 00:07:51,383
Ross: Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the-  -the bus stop... I'm fine.

91
00:07:52,390 --> 00:08:03,093
Joey: Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!  What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.

92
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:06,233
Rachel: So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!

93
00:08:06,303 --> 00:08:11,297
Kiki: Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!

94
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,361
Joanne: Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.

95
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:16,312
Rachel: Okay.

96
00:08:16,347 --> 00:08:18,730
Joanne: When are you coming home?

97
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,113
Rachel: What? Guys, I'm not.

98
00:08:21,218 --> 00:08:23,169
Joanne: C'mon, this is us.

99
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:29,148
Rachel: I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-

100
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,320
I even do my own laundry.

101
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,863
This is what I'm doing now.

102
00:08:37,863 --> 00:08:39,393
Kiki: Waitressing?

103
00:08:40,171 --> 00:09:01,289
Rachel: Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.

104
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:06,091
Leslie: Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.

105
00:09:16,106 --> 00:09:25,239
Monica: Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? 

106
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:26,732
Rachel: What's that?

107
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,148
Monica: Weeeell, it's rum, and-

108
00:09:28,252 --> 00:09:30,152
Rachel: Okay. 

109
00:09:32,122 --> 00:09:40,158
Monica: We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got _Twister_... 

110
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:49,331
Phoebe: Ooh! Ooh! And I brought _Operation_! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!

111
00:09:51,275 --> 00:09:53,726
Monica: Uh, Rach, it's the _Visa _card people.

112
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,177
Rachel: Oh, God, ask them what they want.

113
00:09:56,247 --> 00:10:04,252
Monica:  Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.

114
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:06,380
Rachel: But I haven't used my card in weeks!

115
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:13,261
Monica: That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.

116
00:10:13,297 --> 00:10:34,213
Rachel: They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?

117
00:10:36,186 --> 00:10:41,282
Monica:  Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?

118
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:47,296
Rachel: Alright, c'mon!  Let's play _Twister_!

119
00:10:55,306 --> 00:11:00,242
Ross:  Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.

120
00:11:00,277 --> 00:11:07,273
Chandler: What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?

121
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:19,252
Ross: No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...

122
00:11:19,296 --> 00:11:21,389
Joey: C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.

123
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:25,294
Monica: You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!

124
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:32,298
Rachel: Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?

125
00:11:32,376 --> 00:11:34,293
Phoebe: You are just like Jack.

126
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,210
Rachel: ...Jack from downstairs?

127
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,415
Phoebe: No, Jack and the Beanstalk.

128
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:42,184
Monica: Ah, the other Jack.

129
00:11:42,219 --> 00:11:58,326
Phoebe: Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..

130
00:11:58,402 --> 00:12:07,756
Rachel: Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-

131
00:12:07,756 --> 00:12:10,270
Phoebe: Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.

132
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:17,185
Rachel: But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like...

133
00:12:17,254 --> 00:12:18,249
Phoebe: Floopy?

134
00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:19,244
Rachel: Yeah.

135
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:29,290
Monica: So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.

136
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,164
Phoebe: Oh, like that's a word.

137
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:39,171
Rachel: Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?

138
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,404
Monica: ...Pheebs?

139
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:46,371
Phoebe: Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.

140
00:12:47,284 --> 00:12:56,190
Rachel: Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?

141
00:12:59,296 --> 00:13:05,333
Ross: Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!

142
00:13:06,136 --> 00:13:10,128
Chandler:  See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.

143
00:13:10,174 --> 00:13:12,267
Ross: Pass it! Pass it!

144
00:13:12,342 --> 00:13:14,793
Chandler: He's open!

145
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:17,244
All: Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!

146
00:13:22,252 --> 00:13:25,153
Chandler: Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!

147
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,292
Chandler: 'Scuse me.

148
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:50,203
Receptionist:  It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied.

149
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:55,413
Chandler: Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. 

150
00:13:58,222 --> 00:14:01,214
Receptionist: 

151
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:07,795
Ross:  Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.

152
00:14:07,795 --> 00:14:10,161
Receptionist: Well, you'll have to wait your turn.

153
00:14:10,234 --> 00:14:12,731
Joey: Well, how long do you think it'll be?

154
00:14:12,731 --> 00:14:15,228
Receptionist:  Any minute now.

155
00:14:17,341 --> 00:14:19,332
Ross: Hey, this-  Heyy...

156
00:14:31,355 --> 00:14:36,155
Rachel: I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.

157
00:14:36,193 --> 00:14:41,289
Monica: No, you were right. I don't have a plan. 

158
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:45,267
Pizza Guy:  Pizza guy!

159
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:47,167
Rachel: Thank God. Food. 

160
00:14:47,204 --> 00:14:48,233
Monica: Phoebe?

161
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:49,262
Phoebe: What?

162
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,336
Monica: Do you have a plan?

163
00:14:51,336 --> 00:14:53,366
Phoebe: I don't even have a 'pl'.

164
00:14:56,213 --> 00:14:58,374
Pizza Guy: Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?

165
00:14:59,183 --> 00:15:06,418
Rachel:  No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.

166
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:14,126
Pizza Guy: Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos?' Man, my dad's gonna kill me!

167
00:15:14,231 --> 00:15:18,258
Monica:  Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'

168
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:23,329
Pizza Guy: Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!

169
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:25,739
When you do that,

170
00:15:25,739 --> 00:15:27,337
you're only hitting yourself.

171
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:35,339
Monica: Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?

172
00:15:35,385 --> 00:15:37,381
Pizza Guy: Yeah, that sounds about right.

173
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:39,377
Monica: Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?

174
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,822
Phoebe: And-and a power tie?

175
00:15:41,822 --> 00:15:43,454
Pizza Guy: No, pretty much just a towel.

176
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,190
Monica:  Oh God.

177
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,186
Pizza Guy: So you guys want me to take this back?

178
00:15:48,298 --> 00:15:53,200
Monica: Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza! 

179
00:15:56,406 --> 00:16:01,207
Rachel: Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?

180
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:05,307
Phoebe: Big Bird's friend.

181
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:08,798
Monica: I see pizza!

182
00:16:08,798 --> 00:16:10,345
Phoebe: Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! 

183
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:13,112
Rachel: Hello? Who are we spying on?

184
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:20,126
Monica: White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?

185
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,166
Rachel: Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!

186
00:16:24,268 --> 00:16:26,850
Phoebe: Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.

187
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,432
Monica: Please tell me it's his mother.

188
00:16:30,173 --> 00:16:31,270
Phoebe: Definitely not his mother.

189
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,367
Monica: Oh, no...

190
00:16:33,143 --> 00:16:41,339
Phoebe: Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- 

191
00:16:56,366 --> 00:17:23,251
Chandler: Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with?  Ba-!

192
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,125
Come on, push me.

193
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,120
No.

194
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:30,279
Push me.

195
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,359
We're gonna get in trouble.

196
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,228
Don't be a baby. Push me. Push me.

197
00:17:34,338 --> 00:17:37,239
All right. I'm gonna push you, okay?

198
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:40,140
How about I push you like this?

199
00:17:41,378 --> 00:17:44,358
Now you're gonna be in a wheelchair

200
00:17:44,358 --> 00:17:47,338
the rest of your life, pally-wally....

201
00:17:49,286 --> 00:17:55,156
I am so very sorry. Can I sign you?

202
00:17:57,294 --> 00:17:58,278
Monica: Light still out?

203
00:17:58,278 --> 00:17:59,262
Rachel: Yeah.

204
00:17:59,363 --> 00:18:02,230
Monica: Oh. Maybe they're- napping.

205
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:04,716
Rachel: Oh please, they're having sex.

206
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:07,133
Monica and Phoebe: Shut up!

207
00:18:10,107 --> 00:18:14,305
Rachel: So, whaddya think George is like?

208
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:15,743
Monica: I think he's shy.

209
00:18:15,743 --> 00:18:17,142
Phoebe: Yeah?

210
00:18:17,214 --> 00:18:25,244
Monica: Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.

211
00:18:26,256 --> 00:18:27,740
What do you think of the guys?

212
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,224
Our guys?

213
00:18:29,326 --> 00:18:31,226
Yeah, our guys.

214
00:18:31,226 --> 00:18:33,126
I feel funny talking about that.

215
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,743
Oh, come on.

216
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:36,256
Okay. Well....

217
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,783
I think Joey's like

218
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,233
a little kiddie ride.

219
00:18:39,336 --> 00:18:41,384
You just have to put the quarter in

220
00:18:41,384 --> 00:18:43,432
and it just goes.

221
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:47,238
He might surprise you. One time,

222
00:18:47,238 --> 00:18:52,247
he helped me put on my coat and he was really tender.

223
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:57,150
Come on, baby, come on. Let's go.

224
00:18:57,254 --> 00:18:59,188
Yes!

225
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,641
Chandler's one of those repressed guys

226
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,092
who you'd have to seduce.

227
00:19:05,128 --> 00:19:07,608
I think it's an act. Chandler is

228
00:19:07,608 --> 00:19:10,088
more sophisticated than he seems.

229
00:19:15,205 --> 00:19:16,302
You know who's kind of sexy?

230
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:17,399
Don't.

231
00:19:18,141 --> 00:19:19,722
Ross.

232
00:19:19,722 --> 00:19:21,303
No, guys. Please, he is my brother.

233
00:19:21,344 --> 00:19:23,295
I know exactly what you mean.

234
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,246
He can be really smooth.

235
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,260
Can't you just picture him in bed?

236
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:41,422
I really don't want to.

237
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:52,271
Ross: I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.

238
00:19:52,375 --> 00:20:00,241
Chandler: Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?

239
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:10,383
Joey: He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.

240
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,387
Ross: Look, it's just a little more complicated...

241
00:20:14,197 --> 00:20:18,395
Chandler: Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?

242
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:24,299
Ross: Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...

243
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:28,201
Chandler: Then what?

244
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:34,376
Ross: My first time with Carol was... 

245
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:36,409
Joey: What?

246
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:44,283
Ross: It was my first time.

247
00:20:44,427 --> 00:20:52,393
Joey: With Carol?  Oh.

248
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:57,204
Chandler: So in your whole life, you've only been with oneoh.

249
00:20:58,408 --> 00:21:06,274
Joey: Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!

250
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:17,149
Monica: Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?

251
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:21,392
Monica: Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!

252
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:28,393
Phoebe: Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.

253
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,185
Monica: What?! You slept with Jason?

254
00:21:31,185 --> 00:21:33,164
Phoebe: You'd already broken up.

255
00:21:33,276 --> 00:21:34,322
Rachel: How long?

256
00:21:34,322 --> 00:21:35,368
Phoebe: A couple hours.

257
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:38,278
Monica: Oh, that's nice!

258
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:47,379
Rachel: Okay, okay, okay, I got one!  Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.

259
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,225
Monica: Excuse me?!

260
00:21:50,293 --> 00:21:59,293
Rachel: Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one?  She was a big girl.

261
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:06,166
Monica: Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!

262
00:22:06,276 --> 00:22:09,245
Rachel: I was laughing! You made me laugh! 

263
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,146
Phoebe: There he is! There he is!

264
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:13,796
Monica: Where?

265
00:22:13,796 --> 00:22:15,343
Phoebe: Right- where we've been looking all night!

266
00:22:16,152 --> 00:22:17,648
Rachel: He is so cute!

267
00:22:17,648 --> 00:22:19,144
Monica: Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!

268
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:26,156
All: Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop thewowww.

269
00:22:28,398 --> 00:22:33,392
Joey: Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?

270
00:22:34,371 --> 00:22:40,466
Chandler: I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...

271
00:22:41,378 --> 00:22:42,402
Joey: Really?

272
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:46,273
Chandler: No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. 

273
00:22:46,316 --> 00:22:48,284
Both: Hey, buddy.

274
00:22:52,222 --> 00:22:56,215
Receptionist:  Oh, that's attractive.

275
00:22:57,327 --> 00:23:06,233
Chandler: Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.

276
00:23:06,336 --> 00:23:11,365
Ross: Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?

277
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:13,638
Joey: Oh, ah- the kid has it.

278
00:23:13,638 --> 00:23:18,341
Ross: The kid...?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.

279
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:23,245
Kid: I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers. 

280
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:27,453
Chandler: You gotta do it, man.

281
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:35,294
Ross:  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.

282
00:23:35,294 --> 00:23:36,391
Kid: No.

283
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:37,764
Ross: 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!

284
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:38,361
Kid: No! No! 

285
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:39,385
Give me my puck.

286
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:40,369
No.

287
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:42,371
Receptionist: Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!

288
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:45,300
Ross: 

289
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,375
Ross: ...Now that was fun.

290
00:23:58,221 --> 00:24:02,317
Ross:  Okay, Monica: Right foot red.

291
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:06,318
Monica: Could've played _Monopoly_, but nooooo.

292
00:24:12,268 --> 00:24:14,168
Chandler: Thanks. 

293
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:24,177
Ross: Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. 

294
00:24:31,187 --> 00:24:33,183
Ross, switch with me

295
00:24:33,183 --> 00:24:35,179
and Phoebe could be number two.

296
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,873
Nothing. It's a Twister thing.

297
00:24:38,873 --> 00:24:41,353
The rules are on the back of the box.

298
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,170
Chandler: Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the _Visa _card people.

299
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:50,239
Rachel: Oh, okay. Will you take my place?

300
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,207
Chandler: Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel.

301
00:24:52,308 --> 00:25:05,117
Rachel: Nooo!  Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.

302
00:25:05,221 --> 00:25:07,313
Ross: Green. To the green.

303
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:14,262
Rachel:  Never-never mind.

304
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,231
Chandler: To the left, to the left- aww! 

305
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:20,325
Rachel:  Ohhh... I'm fine. LAUGH
