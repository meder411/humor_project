1
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:06,905
Monica: Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.

2
00:00:06,905 --> 00:00:17,281
Ross: Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right? LAUGH

3
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,342
Rachel: Come on! You guys can pee standing up.

4
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:23,286
Chandler: We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.

5
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:37,301
Joey: Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.

6
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:44,368
Phoebe: Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.

7
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:53,376
Ross: Multiple orgasms! LAUGH

8
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:52,266
 LAUGH

9
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,442
Chandler: So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!

10
00:01:54,442 --> 00:01:55,471
Joey: No plans, huh? LAUGH

11
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,474
Chandler: Not a one.

12
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:02,248
Ross: Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?

13
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:12,314
Chandler: Oh, right, right, shut up. LAUGH

14
00:02:12,314 --> 00:02:31,348
Monica: Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it. LAUGH

15
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:37,444
Chandler: No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.

16
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,283
Joey: Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.

17
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:45,262
Phoebe: You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.

18
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,492
Chandler: Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.

19
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,383
Ross: Tony?

20
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:57,305
Monica: Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?

21
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,243
Phoebe: Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.

22
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:09,221
Rachel:  Does anybody want anything else? LAUGH

23
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,449
Ross: Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing.  Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.

24
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:17,217
Phoebe:  What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?

25
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,356
Rachel: It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.

26
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:27,238
Ross: That guy, he burns me up.

27
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,274
Rachel: Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me _young lady_. LAUGH

28
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:34,242
Chandler: Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.

29
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:40,444
Monica: Did he give you that whole "You're-not-up-to-this" thing again?

30
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,483
Phoebe:  Uh-huh, uh-huh. LAUGH

31
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,352
Angela: Hi, Joey.

32
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,454
Joey: My god, Angela.

33
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,032
Monica: Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.

34
00:03:54,032 --> 00:04:13,834
Phoebe: Are you gonna go over there?

35
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:15,250
Joey: No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool.  Hey, Angela.

36
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,413
Angela:  Joey.

37
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:21,353
Joey: You look good. LAUGH

38
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,231
Angela: That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.

39
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,370
Joey: You don't say.

40
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,465
Ross: So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?

41
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:44,280
Rachel: Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.

42
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,479
Ross: Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?

43
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:57,259
Rachel: Who?

44
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,289
Ross: Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?

45
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:23,788
Rachel: Don't you have a laundry room in your building?

46
00:05:23,788 --> 00:05:25,221
Ross: Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?

47
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,394
Rachel: Sure.

48
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:32,527
Angela: Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.

49
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:41,535
Joey: Bob? Who the hell's Bob?

50
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:50,338
Angela: Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob... LAUGH

51
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:57,449
Joey: Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.

52
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,241
Angela: Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?

53
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:00,225
Joey: What?

54
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:06,197
Angela: We're just friends.

55
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,391
Joey: Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?

56
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:14,238
Angela: What four of us? LAUGH

57
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,240


58
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:21,301
Joey: Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.

59
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:35,516
Monica: Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet. LAUGH

60
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:36,842
Joey: Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...

61
00:06:36,842 --> 00:06:37,422
Monica:  Oh, god help us.

62
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,363
Joey: What?

63
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:51,374
Monica: Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww! LAUGH

64
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:54,538
Joey: Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.

65
00:06:55,281 --> 00:07:16,292
Monica: What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.

66
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,273
Hold on a sec.

67
00:07:26,273 --> 00:07:28,303
You need to not touch any of those. LAUGH

68
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:35,253


69
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:40,248
Ross:  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.

70
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:44,227
Chandler: Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through? LAUGH

71
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:50,428
Ross: It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.

72
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,851
Chandler: It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date. LAUGH

73
00:07:53,851 --> 00:07:59,711
Ross: Nuh-uh. LAUGH

74
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:02,179
Is it a date if she doesn't know?

75
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,732
Yes, absolutely.

76
00:08:04,732 --> 00:08:07,183
Saturday night, all rules apply. LAUGH

77
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:11,222
Chandler: Yuh-huh.

78
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:20,393
Ross: So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what? LAUGH

79
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,328
Chandler: Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty? LAUGH

80
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,297
Ross:  No.

81
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:43,885
Chandler: Oh, and uh, the fabric softener? LAUGH

82
00:08:43,885 --> 00:08:45,415
Ross: Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my _Snuggles_? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way. LAUGH

83
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:54,229
 LAUGH

84
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,424
Monica: Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?

85
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:58,399
Joey: Yep.

86
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,462
Monica: Which?

87
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,821
Joey: Which what?

88
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:04,368
Monica: You've never met Bob, have you?

89
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:06,826
Joey: No, but he's... LAUGH

90
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:09,209
Monica: Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...

91
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:13,308
Angela: Hey, Joey.

92
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,188


93
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,489
Chandler: Where are they? Where are they?

94
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,394
Phoebe: This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us. LAUGH

95
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:31,301
Chandler: It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies. LAUGH

96
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,921
Phoebe: Eww, I don't wanna do that.

97
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:35,337
Chandler: Here we go.

98
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,261
Phoebe: Ok, have a good break-up.

99
00:09:39,261 --> 00:09:45,240
Chandler: Hey, Janice. LAUGH

100
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:51,346
Janice: Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day.

101
00:09:51,424 --> 00:10:09,339
Chandler: Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please? LAUGH

102
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:10,237
Janice: We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping...... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you... LAUGH

103
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,941
Chandler: What?

104
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:13,539
Janice: What?

105
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:19,274
Chandler:  What... did you get me there? LAUGH

106
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,343
Janice: I got you...these. 

107
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:34,363
Chandler: Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet. LAUGH

108
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:42,269
Chandler: That's great.

109
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,570
Chandler: Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?

110
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,850
Janice:  No, no, I'm still working on mine. LAUGH

111
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,283
Chandler: That's it?

112
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,871
Phoebe: Yeah, it was really hard.

113
00:10:56,871 --> 00:10:59,322
Chandler: Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal. LAUGH

114
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,778
Sorry.

115
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:05,228
How are things going?

116
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,794
Going? Things are not going.

117
00:11:06,794 --> 00:11:08,324
She got me socks.

118
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,948
These go with your Rockys. She really

119
00:11:10,948 --> 00:11:13,462
cares about you-- I'm sorry.

120
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,477


121
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,488
Woman: Comin' through. Move, move.

122
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,357
Rachel: Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.

123
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,401
Woman: Yeah, well, now you're kinda not.

124
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:51,570
Rachel: But I saved it. I put my basket on top. LAUGH

125
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,268
Woman: Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds.

126
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:58,374
Rachel: What?

127
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,412
Woman: No suds, no save. Ok? LAUGH

128
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:06,423
Ross: What's goin' on?

129
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,318
Rachel: Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.

130
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:09,439
Ross: Was your basket on top?

131
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:10,451
Rachel: Yeah, but, there were no suds.

132
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,861
Ross: So?

133
00:12:12,861 --> 00:12:19,225
Rachel: Well, you know, no suds, no save.

134
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,362
Ross: No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second.  That's my friend's machine.

135
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:25,432
Woman: Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it.

136
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:47,388
Ross: Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it. LAUGH

137
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,458
Ross:  Ok, let's do laundry. LAUGH

138
00:12:51,504 --> 00:13:02,413
Rachel: That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.

139
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,785
Ross: Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent. LAUGH

140
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:12,415
Rachel: What's that?

141
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:18,260
Ross: _Uberveiss_. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough. LAUGH

142
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:28,363
Ross: Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?

143
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,468
Rachel: Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?

144
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:42,447
Ross: Rach, have you never done this before? LAUGH

145
00:13:43,455 --> 00:14:10,213
Rachel: Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin. LAUGH

146
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:18,313
Ross: Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things. LAUGH

147
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,258
Rachel:  Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?

148
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:31,233
 LAUGH

149
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,450
Monica:  So, where did you guys grow up?

150
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,530
Angela: Brooklyn Heights.

151
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:35,905
Bob: Cleveland.

152
00:14:35,905 --> 00:14:36,536
Monica: How, how did that happen?

153
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,435
Joey: Oh my god.

154
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:46,441
Monica: What?

155
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,385

Joey: Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.

199
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,475
Monica: Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
