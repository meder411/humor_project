1
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,378
Ross: Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.

2
00:00:30,256 --> 00:00:31,484
Monica: W-wait. What is that?

3
00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:33,754
Ross: 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?

4
00:00:33,754 --> 00:00:35,250
Monica: No, no, I don't.

5
00:00:35,294 --> 00:00:37,376
Rachel: Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?

6
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,458
Ross: My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.

7
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:44,461
Phoebe: That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?

8
00:00:48,274 --> 00:00:50,469
Chandler: Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass! LAUGH

9
00:00:55,314 --> 00:00:58,282
Monica: Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?

10
00:00:58,384 --> 00:01:01,318
Ross: Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...

11
00:01:01,421 --> 00:01:03,355
Monica: Why don't you just get a roommate?

12
00:01:03,423 --> 00:01:15,457
Ross: Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe-  ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.

13
00:02:05,318 --> 00:02:12,355
Phoebe: So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.

14
00:02:14,393 --> 00:02:17,328
Chandler: Might wanna open with the snowman. LAUGH

15
00:02:18,364 --> 00:02:20,422
All: Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy.

16
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:23,230
Monica: So, how'd it go?

17
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,226
Joey: Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.

18
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:29,240
Ross: How could you not get it? You were Santa last year. LAUGH

19
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:38,349
Joey: I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political. LAUGH

20
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:39,914
Monica: So what are you gonna be?

21
00:02:39,914 --> 00:02:45,247
Joey: Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?

22
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:52,395
Rachel: Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's?  Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?

23
00:02:52,465 --> 00:03:03,240
Chandler: Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud! LAUGH

24
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:10,310
Rachel: Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.

25
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:20,324
Phoebe: Yeah, you wish! LAUGH

26
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:30,325
Chandler: It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner. LAUGH

27
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:31,461
All: Yeah, okay. Alright.

28
00:03:32,271 --> 00:03:34,364
Chandler: Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.

29
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:38,389
Rachel: Phoebe, you're on. LAUGH

30
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:39,435
Phoebe: Oh, oh, good.

31
00:03:40,246 --> 00:03:46,275
Rachel:  Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!

32
00:03:49,455 --> 00:03:51,480
Hi. Thanks. Hi.

33
00:03:52,491 --> 00:03:54,442
I wanna start with a song

34
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,393
that means a lot to me.

35
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:14,441
> _I made a man with eyes of coal   And a smile so bewitchin',   How was I supposed to know   That my mom was dead in the kitchen?_    _La lalala la la la la lalala la la..._

36
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:39,370
> _...My mother's ashes   Even her eyelashes   Are resting in a little yellow jar,   And sometimes when it's breezy..._ LAUGH

37
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:45,358
> _...I feel a little sneezy   And now I-_ 

38
00:04:45,358 --> 00:04:53,284
Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys!  Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group?

39
00:04:54,353 --> 00:04:56,480
Max: No. No, that's- that's okay.

40
00:04:57,256 --> 00:05:03,286
Phoebe: Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!

41
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:06,229
Chandler:  That guy's going home with a note! LAUGH

42
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:12,819
David: Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-

43
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:14,201
Phoebe: Could you speak up please?

44
00:05:14,307 --> 00:05:20,405
David:  Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought

45
00:05:21,213 --> 00:05:30,215
David: Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a

46
00:05:30,323 --> 00:05:33,315
Max: Hard quality.

47
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:47,228
David: -hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling. LAUGH

48
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,244
Phoebe: Okay, we're gonna take a short break. LAUGH

49
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:04,279
Joey: Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!

50
00:06:09,295 --> 00:06:11,195
Ross: Come here, Marcel. Sit here. 

51
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:28,405
Rachel: Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much? LAUGH

52
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:31,443
Ross: Just a smidge. LAUGH

53
00:06:32,418 --> 00:06:36,252
Phoebe: David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.

54
00:06:36,322 --> 00:06:37,334
Monica: I think it's romantic.

55
00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:42,258
Phoebe: Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?

56
00:06:42,361 --> 00:07:05,182
Phoebe: Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... LAUGH

57
00:07:07,286 --> 00:07:12,385
Chandler: Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.

58
00:07:12,385 --> 00:07:17,191
Phoebe: No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?

59
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:20,916
Chandler: Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.

60
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,400
Monica: What?! LAUGH

61
00:07:22,435 --> 00:07:25,336
Ross: C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!

62
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:28,304
Chandler: I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.

63
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,341
Monica: Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!

64
00:07:31,444 --> 00:07:35,244
Chandler: I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped! LAUGH

65
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:39,317
Joey: Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.

66
00:07:47,526 --> 00:07:52,354
Chandler: Too many jokes... must mock Joey! LAUGH

67
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,235
Joey: Nice shoes, huh? 

68
00:07:58,237 --> 00:07:59,465
Chandler: Aah, y'killing me!

69
00:08:01,407 --> 00:08:05,173
Monica: Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!

70
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,728
Ross: Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?

71
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:10,179
Monica: Do you always have to bring him here?

72
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:27,295
Ross: I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...

73
00:08:30,336 --> 00:08:33,328
Chandler: Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.

74
00:08:33,439 --> 00:08:41,402
Ross: Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.

75
00:08:42,214 --> 00:08:45,206
Chandler: Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.

76
00:08:51,423 --> 00:09:00,813
David: ...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions. LAUGH

77
00:09:00,813 --> 00:09:03,162
Phoebe: Okay, alright, I have a question, then.

78
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:04,299
David: Yuh.

79
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:05,396
Phoebe: Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?

80
00:09:09,475 --> 00:09:29,318
David: Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be  yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you.

81
00:09:29,395 --> 00:09:30,384
Phoebe: Sure.

82
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:45,341
David: Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella. LAUGH

83
00:09:45,444 --> 00:09:54,311
Phoebe: Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body. LAUGH

84
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:55,884
David: Rrrreally.

85
00:09:55,884 --> 00:10:00,214
Phoebe: Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.

86
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:04,375
David: ...Now? Now?

87
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,421
Phoebe: Oh yeah, right now.

88
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:07,465
David: Okay, okay, okay. 

89
00:10:10,436 --> 00:10:11,886
You know what?

90
00:10:11,886 --> 00:10:13,336
This is really expensive.

91
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,374
And this was a gift.

92
00:10:17,443 --> 00:10:18,939
Phoebe: Okay, now you're just kinda tidying. LAUGH

93
00:10:18,939 --> 00:10:26,746
David: Okay, what the hell, what the hell.  You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?

94
00:10:26,746 --> 00:10:28,242
Phoebe: I can hop. 

95
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,396
Ross: So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?

96
00:10:48,474 --> 00:10:54,469
Monica: I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.

97
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:55,542
Chandler: Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?

98
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:56,571
Monica: Yeah.

99
00:10:57,383 --> 00:10:59,413
Joey: You know more than one Fun Bobby? LAUGH

100
00:10:59,413 --> 00:11:01,443
Chandler: I happen to know a Fun Bob.

101
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,889
Rachel:  Okay, here we go...

102
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:08,323
Joey: Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!

103
00:11:13,432 --> 00:11:15,457
Rachel:  There. Now there is. LAUGH

104
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:20,365
Ross: Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.

105
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,286
Joey: Uh, four.

106
00:11:22,286 --> 00:11:23,332
Rachel: Five.

107
00:11:24,276 --> 00:11:26,436
Rachel: Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.

108
00:11:27,246 --> 00:11:32,444
Joey: Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do? LAUGH

109
00:11:33,352 --> 00:11:37,448
Ross: Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?

110
00:11:38,257 --> 00:11:42,283
Rachel: Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.

111
00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:46,353
Ross: Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.

112
00:11:46,465 --> 00:11:47,864
Monica: What's the matter?

113
00:11:47,864 --> 00:12:00,309
Ross: Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...

114
00:12:01,213 --> 00:12:04,205
Chandler: That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.

115
00:12:04,316 --> 00:12:05,311
Ross: Really.

116
00:12:05,311 --> 00:12:09,218
Chandler: Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.

117
00:12:12,224 --> 00:12:14,215
Ross: What, uh... what juggling thing? LAUGH

118
00:12:14,426 --> 00:12:17,418
Chandler: With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.

119
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,421
Ross: No.

120
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:25,232
Chandler: Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...

121
00:12:29,274 --> 00:12:30,354
Max: Phoebe. Hi.

122
00:12:30,354 --> 00:12:31,434
Phoebe: Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?

123
00:12:31,477 --> 00:12:34,344
Max: No. Have you seen David? LAUGH

124
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:36,373
Phoebe: No, no, he hasn't been around.

125
00:12:36,482 --> 00:12:40,440
Max: Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk.

126
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:42,316
Phoebe: Minsk?

127
00:12:42,316 --> 00:12:43,379
Max: Minsk. It's in Russia.

128
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,380
Phoebe: I know where Minsk is. LAUGH

129
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,490
Max: We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid.

130
00:12:52,297 --> 00:12:53,844
And if you're gonna do Minsk,

131
00:12:53,844 --> 00:12:55,391
that's the way to go. LAUGH

132
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,481
Phoebe: So when, when do you leave?

133
00:12:57,481 --> 00:12:58,561
Max: January first.

134
00:13:06,445 --> 00:13:08,925
Phoebe: Hello? LAUGH

135
00:13:08,925 --> 00:13:11,405
David: Hey!

136
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:13,781
David: Hi!  What-what're you doing here?

137
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:18,355
Phoebe: Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so  congratulations! This is so exciting!

138
00:13:19,525 --> 00:13:22,459
Max: It'd be even more exciting if we were going. LAUGH

139
00:13:23,228 --> 00:13:25,423
Phoebe: Oh, you're not going?  Oh, why?

140
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:35,531
Max: Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!' 

141
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:38,436
David: Thank you, Max. Thank you. LAUGH

142
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,247
Phoebe: So-so you're really not going?

143
00:13:42,347 --> 00:13:43,843
David: I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.

144
00:13:43,843 --> 00:13:45,339
I just....

145
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,900
How can I leave you?

146
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,350
I just found you.

147
00:13:48,387 --> 00:13:52,255
Oh, David. But what are you gonna do?

148
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:56,452
David: I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.

149
00:13:57,262 --> 00:13:58,377
Phoebe: Oh don't do that.

150
00:13:58,377 --> 00:13:59,492
David: No, but I'm asking-

151
00:14:00,232 --> 00:14:01,813
Phoebe: Oh, but I can't do that-

152
00:14:01,813 --> 00:14:03,394
Phoebe: Okay, um, stay.

153
00:14:06,205 --> 00:14:06,751
David: Stay.

154
00:14:06,751 --> 00:14:07,297
Phoebe: Stay.

155
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:17,407
Phoebe: Getting so good at that! LAUGH

156
00:14:19,218 --> 00:14:21,243
David: It was Max's stuff. 

157
00:14:29,228 --> 00:14:35,359
Janice: I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow! 

158
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:42,332
Chandler: You remember Janice.

159
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:45,242
Monica: Vividly. LAUGH

160
00:14:45,444 --> 00:14:47,395
How are you?

161
00:14:47,395 --> 00:14:49,346
I am fantastic.

162
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:50,370
Now.

163
00:14:52,284 --> 00:14:53,882
It's amazing. We've been back LAUGH

164
00:14:53,882 --> 00:14:57,420
together for what like 10 minutes, and--

165
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,552
Is that all?

166
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:02,283
It's like we were never apart. LAUGH

167
00:15:02,394 --> 00:15:04,294
Of course, we were, but--

168
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:06,194
Forgive and forget.

169
00:15:06,298 --> 00:15:08,391
Well, forget.

170
00:15:19,344 --> 00:15:19,890
Monica: Hi. LAUGH

171
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,436
Sandy: Hi, I'm Sandy.

172
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:35,338
Joey: Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids. LAUGH

173
00:15:35,338 --> 00:15:37,351
Sandy: Yeah. That's okay, right?

174
00:15:39,431 --> 00:15:41,831
Ross: Par-tay!

175
00:15:41,831 --> 00:15:44,231
Monica: That thing is not coming in here.

176
00:15:44,336 --> 00:15:51,369
Ross: 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?

177
00:15:52,277 --> 00:15:56,269
Monica: I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.

178
00:15:56,348 --> 00:16:07,384
Ross: Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened... LAUGH

179
00:16:08,393 --> 00:16:11,419
Monica: Alright. Just keep him away from me.

180
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,289
Thank you. Come on, Marcel.

181
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:17,297
What do you say you and I mingle?

182
00:16:18,337 --> 00:16:22,433
Ross: Thank you.  Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later. LAUGH

183
00:16:28,246 --> 00:16:35,786
Monica: Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?

184
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,254
Rachel: Rome. Jerk missed his flight.

185
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:40,448
Phoebe: And then... your face is bloated? LAUGH

186
00:16:42,327 --> 00:17:27,771
Rachel: No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party?  Are people eating my dip? LAUGH

187
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:29,204
Yes. LAUGH

188
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,405
There.

189
00:17:36,314 --> 00:17:38,327
That looks okay, right?

190
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:40,340
You went a bit wide on the lipstick.

191
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:41,835
Oh, I did?

192
00:17:41,835 --> 00:17:43,251
Yeah.

193
00:17:43,321 --> 00:17:45,272
It's hard for me to tell.

194
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,223
My eye's closing up. LAUGH

195
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:49,260
Let me get it for you.

196
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:50,891
Ow!

197
00:17:50,891 --> 00:17:51,420
Okay.

198
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,255
You know what? It looks fine. LAUGH

199
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:57,264
Okay, here we go.

200
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:59,337
Screw Paolo,

201
00:17:59,337 --> 00:18:01,305
screw the psycho cab lady.

202
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:02,890
It's New Year's Eve.

203
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,374
Let's have a good time.

204
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:05,359
Okay, here we go.

205
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:06,309
Okay.

206
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:09,370
All right, there you go. This way. LAUGH

207
00:18:10,482 --> 00:18:12,313
Here you go.

208
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:23,321
Sandy: Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf.

209
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,409
Joey: Wow, that's, uh, dirty.

210
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:29,388
Sandy: Yeah. LAUGH

211
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:34,498
Joey: Hey, kids...

212
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:42,246
Ross:  Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in. LAUGH

213
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:49,414
Janice:  There you are! Haaah, you got away from me! LAUGH

214
00:18:50,222 --> 00:18:52,218
Chandler:  But you found me! LAUGH

215
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:57,420
Janice: Here, Ross, take our picture.  Smile! You're on Janice Camera!

216
00:18:58,363 --> 00:19:00,194
Chandler: Kill me. Kill me now.

217
00:19:05,203 --> 00:19:07,467
Hi, I'm Rachel.

218
00:19:08,206 --> 00:19:10,299
So whose friend are you?

219
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:17,307
Look at me, spilling everywhere. LAUGH

220
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:21,218
Monica: Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!

221
00:19:24,322 --> 00:19:35,426
Fun Bobby: Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- died about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!

222
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:41,431
Joey:  Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died? LAUGH

223
00:19:46,211 --> 00:19:52,513
Fun Bobby: It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again. LAUGH

224
00:19:57,222 --> 00:20:00,316
Bobby? Fun Bobby? LAUGH

225
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,419
Let me talk to you for just a sec.

226
00:20:04,262 --> 00:20:05,342
I recently lost

227
00:20:05,342 --> 00:20:07,998
a grandparent myself so I really know exactly

228
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,465
how you feel.

229
00:20:10,268 --> 00:20:11,752
But you're really bringing

230
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,236
the party down. LAUGH

231
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:15,385
I'm sorry.

232
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:16,431
Yeah, yeah, okay.

233
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:19,533
There you go. There you go.

234
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:26,239
Janice:  Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter. LAUGH

235
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:36,258
Chandler: Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-

236
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,386
Janice: Oh, no. Oh, no.

237
00:20:42,467 --> 00:20:45,265
Chandler: I'm sorry you misunderstood... LAUGH

238
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:52,407
Janice: Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me. 

239
00:20:54,412 --> 00:20:56,380
Chandler: Oh, will you give me the thing. LAUGH

240
00:21:00,252 --> 00:21:01,298
Phoebe: Hi, Max!

241
00:21:01,298 --> 00:21:10,451
Max: Yoko.  I've decided to go to Minsk without you. LAUGH

242
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,327
David: Wow.

243
00:21:13,327 --> 00:21:19,267
Max: It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year. LAUGH

244
00:21:20,472 --> 00:21:22,423
Phoebe: Are you alright?

245
00:21:22,423 --> 00:21:24,374
David: Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

246
00:21:29,547 --> 00:21:31,344
Come on. LAUGH

247
00:21:33,385 --> 00:21:35,415
Phoebe: You're going to Minsk.

248
00:21:35,415 --> 00:21:37,445
David: No, I'm... not going to Minsk.

249
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:43,449
Phoebe: Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.

250
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:48,031
David: Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you.

251
00:21:48,031 --> 00:22:11,210
Phoebe: Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say  'no! No! I can't understand that!'. LAUGH

252
00:22:11,323 --> 00:22:11,886
David: Uh, ow. LAUGH

253
00:22:11,886 --> 00:22:19,329
Phoebe: Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me.  And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.

254
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:21,229
Oh, sorry.

255
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:26,334
Phoebe: Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me.  And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.

256
00:22:26,438 --> 00:22:28,463
David: I'll never forget you.

257
00:22:30,342 --> 00:22:47,552
Phoebe: And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it.  I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.

258
00:22:50,362 --> 00:22:57,366
Dick Clark:  Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square...

259
00:22:57,469 --> 00:22:59,369
It gets better every....

260
00:22:59,471 --> 00:23:01,405
Joey: There y'go, kids.

261
00:23:02,207 --> 00:23:04,402
And then the peacock bit me.

262
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,310
Please kiss me at midnight! LAUGH

263
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:14,317
Joey: You seen Sandy?

264
00:23:14,317 --> 00:23:23,223
Chandler: Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.

265
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:25,893
Rachel: Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing. LAUGH

266
00:23:25,893 --> 00:23:27,457
All:  What?

267
00:23:28,466 --> 00:23:31,458
Rachel: The bll is drrbing! LAUGH

268
00:23:33,338 --> 00:23:35,465
Dick Clark:  In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...

269
00:23:36,241 --> 00:23:38,436
Chandler: And the moment of joy is upon us.

270
00:23:39,344 --> 00:23:42,278
Joey: Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.

271
00:23:42,447 --> 00:23:45,279
Phoebe: Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.

272
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,443
Monica: Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!

273
00:23:47,485 --> 00:23:53,390
--four, three, two one! Happy New Year! LAUGH

274
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:04,233
Chandler: Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. 

275
00:24:05,303 --> 00:24:08,237
Phoebe: I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight. LAUGH

276
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:10,290
Rachel: I can't kiss anyone.

277
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,241
Monica: So I'm kissing everyone?

278
00:24:13,211 --> 00:24:16,237
Joey: Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother. LAUGH

279
00:24:16,314 --> 00:24:18,508
Ross: Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.

280
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:24,320
Chandler: Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!

281
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:28,350
Joey: Alrightalrightalright.  There.

282
00:24:35,233 --> 00:24:53,274
Ross:  I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.

283
00:24:53,351 --> 00:24:56,377
Rachel: ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
