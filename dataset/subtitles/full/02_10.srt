1
00:00:05,391 --> 00:00:07,421
Slow down! The paper won't be

2
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:09,451
sold-out at 1 :00 in the morning.

3
00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:10,960
I'm excited!

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,359
I've never been reviewed!

5
00:00:12,464 --> 00:00:14,415
You were so amazing as the king.

6
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:16,366
I was really impressed.

7
00:00:16,468 --> 00:00:17,492
But you know what?

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,385
You might wanna wear LAUGH

9
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:20,500
underwear next time.

10
00:00:21,306 --> 00:00:22,853
When you sat on the throne,

11
00:00:22,853 --> 00:00:26,489
you could see your royal subjects. LAUGH

12
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:28,502
No one wore underwear back then.

13
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:30,879
I'm sure the critics

14
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:32,477
appreciated your authenticity.

15
00:00:32,518 --> 00:00:34,486
Nice genitals, by the way.

16
00:00:35,387 --> 00:00:36,479
Thanks, man. LAUGH

17
00:00:37,322 --> 00:00:38,414
Here it is!

18
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,407
''The only thing worse than

19
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:44,862
the mindless direction was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly

20
00:00:44,862 --> 00:00:47,330
unskilled portrayal of the king.''

21
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:49,524
Look, that is one guy's opinion.

22
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:51,415
All right?

23
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:52,495
Pheebs, read yours.

24
00:00:53,305 --> 00:00:54,869
''The only thing worse

26
00:00:56,542 --> 00:00:58,407
Does anybody have one

27
00:00:58,407 --> 00:01:00,272
from a different paper?

28
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:02,313
Ross, read yours.

29
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:04,247
I don't want to. LAUGH

30
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:07,948
''The one enjoyable moment is when the

31
00:01:07,948 --> 00:01:10,445
king is beheaded and speaks no more.''

32
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:12,937
Joey, they don't know LAUGH

33
00:01:12,937 --> 00:01:14,484
what they're talking about.

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,349
Maybe they do.

35
00:01:16,462 --> 00:01:18,475
I've done this 10 years

36
00:01:18,475 --> 00:01:20,488
and I'm nowhere. There's a reason.

37
00:01:21,266 --> 00:01:23,359
Come on, you're just paying dues. LAUGH

38
00:01:23,402 --> 00:01:25,432
No, no, no. It's too hard.

39
00:01:25,432 --> 00:01:27,462
It's not worth it. I quit.

40
00:01:28,273 --> 00:01:29,297
Come on, Joey!

41
00:01:29,408 --> 00:01:30,454
Wait, wait one minute.

42
00:01:30,454 --> 00:01:31,500
Wait a minute.

43
00:01:32,277 --> 00:01:34,472
I believe this will change your mind.

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,379
''In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiani LAUGH

Is there anything else you

49
00:02:31,936 --> 00:02:33,403
wanted to be?

50
00:02:33,472 --> 00:02:34,496
I don't know.

51
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:41,469
JOEY: When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff. LAUGH

52
00:02:46,385 --> 00:02:47,317
PHOE: Are... are you OK?

53
00:02:47,419 --> 00:03:00,395
ROSS: Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he? LAUGH

54
00:03:00,395 --> 00:03:01,259
MNCA: Maybe.

55
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:02,526
ROSS: Don't toy with me.

56
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:04,348
FBOB: Geller! LAUGH

57
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:05,428
ROSS: Hey, Fun Bobby!

58
00:03:06,238 --> 00:03:07,535
FBOB: Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?

59
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:14,370
ROSS: Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister! LAUGH

60
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,929
MNCA: You and me both.

61
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,379
FBOB: Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?

62
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:20,247
PHOE: Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better.

63
00:03:20,352 --> 00:03:21,848
FBOB: Hey, do you need me to pick you up?

64
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:23,344
JOEY: No, I'm alright man. Really.

65
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:25,252
FBOB: No, I'm picking you up.

66
00:03:25,357 --> 00:03:31,454
JOEY: Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me...  Alright! It still works.

67
00:03:32,264 --> 00:03:37,460
FBOB: OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up?  I'm still gonna go. LAUGH

68
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,371
MNCA: OK, I'll see you later babe.

69
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:46,403
FBOB: Uh, public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes.

ALL: Bye! See you later!

72
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,950
PHOE: Fun Bobby is so great.

73
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:09,425
MNCA: Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full.

74
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:12,326
PHOE: Half full of looooovvvvve.

75
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,436
MNCA: And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend. LAUGH

76
00:04:18,477 --> 00:04:21,241
PHOE: Cabin of loooooovvvvve. LAUGH

77
00:04:23,248 --> 00:04:24,863
RACH: We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys. 

78
00:04:24,863 --> 00:04:26,478
MNCA: Really? I only had two glasses.

79
00:04:27,286 --> 00:04:28,270
JOEY: I just had a glass.

80
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,254
PHOE: Two.

81
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:30,417
RACH: I had one glass.

82
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:36,259
CHAN: I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug. LAUGH

83
00:04:37,262 --> 00:04:42,399
RACH: OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?

84
00:04:55,314 --> 00:04:57,474
MNCA: So what. So he drank a lot tonight. LAUGH

85
00:04:57,582 --> 00:05:04,218
ROSS: Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand.

86
00:05:05,424 --> 00:05:19,233
PHOE: Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'

87
00:05:19,438 --> 00:05:22,430
JOEY: Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?

88
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:34,445
MNCA: Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo.

89
00:05:39,358 --> 00:05:41,451
MNCA: Rach, does this have nonfat milk?

90
00:05:42,294 --> 00:05:44,262
RACH: Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it.

91
00:05:46,465 --> 00:05:47,454
MNCA:  Mmmm, no.

92
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:51,462
RACH: Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some.

93
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:56,398
FBOB:  Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?

94
00:06:00,312 --> 00:06:01,404
PHOE: Um, cake.

95
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:05,314
RACH: Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake. 

96
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:11,444
MNCA: You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.

97
00:06:12,257 --> 00:06:17,353
FBOB: Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.

98
00:06:18,363 --> 00:06:19,421
FBOB: Yeah, OK.

99
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:27,428
MNCA: Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you.

100
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:38,474
FBOB: OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'

101
00:06:41,253 --> 00:06:43,483
MNCA: So, what are you saying now?

102
00:06:44,356 --> 00:06:51,361
FBOB: I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me. 

103
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:55,489
PHOE:  Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?

104
00:06:56,368 --> 00:06:58,302
FBOB: I am gonna try and quit drinking.

105
00:06:58,302 --> 00:07:00,236
PHOE:  Ooohh, why?

106
00:07:07,312 --> 00:07:09,439
CHAN: Guess who's back in show business.

107
00:07:10,248 --> 00:07:11,510
PHOE: Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?

108
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:15,516
CHAN: No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead.

109
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:17,345
PHOE: Oh, no.

110
00:07:19,424 --> 00:07:24,418
CHAN: OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who.

111
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:29,231
JOEY: Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for _Days of Our Lives_!

112
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:30,881
Kick ass!

113
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:32,428
Here's to Joey!

114
00:07:33,438 --> 00:07:35,235
Here Joey.

115
00:07:38,443 --> 00:07:42,379
PHOE: Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme.

116
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:47,441
CHAN: Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia.

117
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:54,256
PHOE: Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight.

118
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:58,456
RACH: Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans.

119
00:07:58,497 --> 00:08:01,295
MNCA:  You have other friends?

120
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,350
RACH: Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date.

121
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,301
MNCA: What?

122
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:06,870
You have a date?

123
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,337
Yes! I have a date.

124
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:10,435
JOEY: With a man?

125
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:13,300
No, with a crouton.

126
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:15,828
RACH: What? What is so strange about me having a date?

127
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,211
With a crouton?

128
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:23,346
JOEY: What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?

129
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:29,224
RACH: Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore.

130
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:31,278
MNCA: What are you talking about?

131
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:36,467
RACH: I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not.

132
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:38,429
PHOE: But you guys came so close.

133
00:08:38,503 --> 00:08:45,332
RACH: Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.

134
00:08:46,344 --> 00:08:51,272
RACH: Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ.

stop calling me already.

139
00:09:12,404 --> 00:09:25,248
ESTL: Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya?  Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later.

146
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:52,273
ESTL: Oh, isn't Lori a doll?

147
00:09:52,344 --> 00:10:10,487
JOEY: Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in.

148
00:10:13,298 --> 00:10:21,466
ESTL: Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out.  Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.

149
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:23,501
Lori, please.

150
00:10:25,477 --> 00:10:27,377
Hi, darling!

151
00:10:27,412 --> 00:10:30,364
How about Joey Tribbiani for the part

152
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:33,316

153
00:10:37,322 --> 00:10:39,381
Okay, doll, talk to you later.

154
00:10:39,491 --> 00:10:42,483
ESTL: Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out.  Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.

155
00:10:45,497 --> 00:10:46,492
RACH: What's the matter?

156
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:47,487
MNCA: It's Fun Bobby.

157
00:10:47,532 --> 00:10:49,028
RACH: What, isn't he sober?

158
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:54,430
MNCA: Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason.

159
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,240
MNCA: Alright, here you go, sweetie. 

160
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:04,346
FBOB: Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?

161
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:06,440
MNCA: Oh God, yes!

162
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:13,253
FBOB: There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.

163
00:11:15,293 --> 00:11:17,261
PHOE: That is funny.

164
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:22,397
FBOB: I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.

165
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:28,370
And I'm walking, and I'm walking and I'm walking, and I'm walking--

166
00:11:28,473 --> 00:11:31,374
So you're saying you were walking.

167
00:11:31,476 --> 00:11:37,380
FBOB: I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.

168
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,514
So it's a helpful fact as well as funny.

169
00:11:51,496 --> 00:11:54,294
MNCA: Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?

170
00:11:54,332 --> 00:11:59,886
FBOB: Oh yeah. See you guys. 

171
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:04,374
CHAN: Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.

172
00:12:05,276 --> 00:12:06,334
MNCA: Oh.... my... God.

173
00:12:06,478 --> 00:12:08,361
PHOE: It's not that bad.

174
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:12,329
MNCA: Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?

175
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:14,377
PHOE: OK, OK, don't get all squinky.

176
00:12:16,287 --> 00:12:19,256
RACH: Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.

177
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:28,364
MNCA: But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me.

178
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:34,500
PHOE: Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free.

179
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:38,270
RUSS: Hi.

180
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,265
CHAN:  Hey Ross.... bahhhh!

181
00:12:40,512 --> 00:12:45,312
RACH: Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?

182
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:54,390
RUSS: OK, I'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend- type....people.

183
00:12:59,397 --> 00:13:00,455
PHOE: Rachel? Um, hi.

184
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,359
PHOE: OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?

185
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,449
RACH: Uhh.... waitressing?

186
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:12,471
PHOE: Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?

187
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:16,344
RACH:  Huh, Bob Saget?

188
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:20,348
PHOE:  Oh, yeah! No, no, no, no, oh, oh.

189
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:22,919
PHOE: Oh, my, oh!

190
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,386
ROSS: What? What's wrong?

191
00:13:26,257 --> 00:13:30,489
MNCA: She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.

192
00:13:32,497 --> 00:13:34,362
ROSS: Alright.

193
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:37,381
Listen, Pheebs.

194
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:38,461
This is gonna be okay.

195
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,271
CHAN:  Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.

196
00:13:42,507 --> 00:13:43,502
RUSS: Hi.

197
00:13:43,502 --> 00:13:44,497
ROSS: Hi.

198
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:46,923
RUSS: Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?

199
00:13:46,923 --> 00:13:51,413
ROSS: Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?

200
00:13:51,482 --> 00:14:01,418
RUSS: Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date-type... thing... of Rachel's.

201
00:14:02,227 --> 00:14:03,324
ROSS: A date.

202
00:14:03,324 --> 00:14:04,421
RUSS: Yeah, I'm her date.

203
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,359
ROSS: Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date.

204
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:14,227
CHAN: You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare.

205
00:14:15,273 --> 00:14:17,434
RUSS: Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist.

206
00:14:18,343 --> 00:14:21,312
ROSS: Yes, yes I am. And you are a....

207
00:14:21,312 --> 00:14:24,281
RUSS: Periodontist.

208
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:29,479
MNCA: See? They're as different as night and... later that night.

209
00:14:30,355 --> 00:14:36,327
ROSS: Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you.

210
00:14:36,327 --> 00:14:38,295
RUSS: Ditto.

211
00:14:43,501 --> 00:14:46,299
ROSS: I, uh, well... I... I met Russ.

212
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:50,467
ROSS: Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.

213
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:54,301
RACH: Well, we're not seeing each other, so....

214
00:14:54,512 --> 00:15:14,914
ROSS: Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...

215
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,364
RACH: Well, yeah, this is the deal.

216
00:15:16,434 --> 00:15:18,425
ROSS: OK, well, um, have a nice evening.

217
00:15:19,437 --> 00:15:20,853
RACH: Um, Russ, you ready?

218
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,269
RUSS: Yeah.

219
00:15:23,341 --> 00:15:24,308
RACH: Bye.

220
00:15:24,308 --> 00:15:25,275
MNCA: Bye.

221
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:31,339
ROSS:  She's dating. She's dating.

222
00:15:31,382 --> 00:15:34,442
CHAN: Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?

223
00:15:35,386 --> 00:15:36,819
ROSS: What do you mean?

224
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:38,252
MNCA: Do you not see it?

225
00:15:38,356 --> 00:15:50,465
ROSS: See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence.

226
00:15:51,402 --> 00:15:53,563
CHAN: Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?

227
00:15:56,274 --> 00:15:57,468
ROSS: ....................Yeah.

228
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,416
CHAN: Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry.

229
00:16:14,325 --> 00:16:15,889
JOEY: Well, the part's mine if I want it.

230
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:17,453
CHAN: Oh my God!

231
00:16:18,229 --> 00:16:20,424
JOEY: Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.

232
00:16:21,232 --> 00:16:23,459
CHAN:  Oh my... God?

233
00:16:24,435 --> 00:16:33,239
JOEY: Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, _Days of Our Lives_. That's actually on television.

234
00:16:33,344 --> 00:16:34,436
CHAN: So, what're you gonna do?

235
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:39,245
JOEY: Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?

236
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:43,446
CHAN: Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know.

237
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:46,303
JOEY: I've never slept with someone for a part.

238
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:48,351
CHAN: Well is she... 

239
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,876
JOEY: Sorry.

240
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:54,359
CHAN: It's alright. Is she good-looking?

241
00:16:54,359 --> 00:17:04,436
JOEY: Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast.  You know, after having slept with her.

242
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:21,347
CHAN: Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas.

243
00:17:24,228 --> 00:17:38,340
JOEY: I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General.

244
00:17:40,244 --> 00:17:42,542
CHAN: Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?

245
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:47,239
JOEY: Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it.

246
00:17:51,456 --> 00:17:53,356
WAITER: Can I get you something from the bar?

247
00:17:53,356 --> 00:17:58,328
MNCA: Yes, I would like something.  No, no thank you.

248
00:17:58,362 --> 00:18:02,230
FBOB: If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it.

249
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:07,294
MNCA: No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it.  Just some water.

250
00:18:07,405 --> 00:18:09,822
FBOB: So the light went out in my refrigerator...

251
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,239
MNCA:  I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.

252
00:18:13,211 --> 00:18:13,506
I'm sorry.

253
00:18:14,245 --> 00:18:27,322
CHAN: Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in _ium_.

254
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,942
RUSS: Dysprosium.

255
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:33,225
ROSS:  Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.

256
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:40,427
CHAN: And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, _Knights in White Satin_ was sung by the Doody Blues.

257
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:45,353
PHOE: You don't see it? You actually don't see it?

258
00:18:45,353 --> 00:18:47,332
RACH: What?

259
00:18:47,445 --> 00:18:49,345
PHOE: OK honey, you're dating Ross.

260
00:18:49,447 --> 00:18:51,847
RACH: No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ.

261
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:54,247
PHOE: Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!

262
00:18:54,285 --> 00:18:55,377
RACH: Steve... sleeve!

263
00:18:55,486 --> 00:18:58,336
PHOE: OK, noone is named Sleeve.

264
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:05,285
RACH: Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing.

265
00:19:05,396 --> 00:19:09,388
ROSS:  For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.

266
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:15,195
RUSS: You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.

267
00:19:15,306 --> 00:19:19,332
CHAN: OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.

268
00:19:21,312 --> 00:19:22,762
RUSS: I know what your problem is.

269
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,212
ROSS: Oh you do, do you?

270
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:26,439
RUSS: Um-hum, you're jealous.

271
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:29,513
ROSS: Of... of what?

272
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:33,416
RUSS: You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.

273
00:19:34,425 --> 00:19:43,358
ROSS: Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma.

274
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:44,429
RUSS: Hey, you listen.

275
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:45,424
ROSS: No, no, let me finish.

276
00:19:45,469 --> 00:19:47,869
RUSS: No, let me finish.

277
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:50,269
ROSS: No, you let me fini...

278
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:04,853
RACH: Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?

279
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:09,450
CHAN: No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?

280
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:12,387
RACH: I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?

281
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:14,361
CHAN: Me.

282
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,265
RACH: Why would I have to sleep with you?

283
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:20,462
CHAN: It's my game. You want the job or not?

284
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,387
MNCA: Morning.

285
00:20:25,387 --> 00:20:26,399
ROSS: Where ya goin'?

286
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:30,379
MNCA: Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?

287
00:20:31,282 --> 00:20:32,846
PHOE: What's with all the bottles of liquor?

288
00:20:32,846 --> 00:20:34,410
Excuse me, miss.

289
00:20:34,518 --> 00:20:36,998
In a water landing, can this seat

290
00:20:36,998 --> 00:20:39,478
be used as a flotation device?

291
00:20:40,491 --> 00:20:43,289
ROSS: What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?

292
00:20:43,394 --> 00:20:51,529
MNCA: Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing.

293
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,501
RACH: Oh God, even his knock is boring.

294
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:02,909
MNCA: Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.

295
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:04,439
FBOB: Uh, can I talk to you a minute?

296
00:21:04,482 --> 00:21:05,471
MNCA: Sure.

297
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:09,282
FBOB: This is really hard for me to say.

298
00:21:09,387 --> 00:21:11,321
MNCA: Oh God, you fell off the wagon.

299
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:14,420
FBOB: Oh, no, no, it's about you.

300
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,483
MNCA: What about me?

301
00:21:16,394 --> 00:21:19,454
FBOB: I think you may have a drinking problem.

302
00:21:22,266 --> 00:21:26,459
MNCA: What these?  Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes.

303
00:21:28,306 --> 00:21:33,368
FBOB: Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK?

304
00:21:33,477 --> 00:21:35,502
MNCA: Oh... shoot.

305
00:21:37,481 --> 00:21:40,415
FBOB: Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends.

306
00:21:40,484 --> 00:21:42,418
MNCA: OK.

307
00:21:45,323 --> 00:21:46,318
MNCA: Take care.

308
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:47,313
FBOB: You too.

309
00:21:47,425 --> 00:21:48,483
Bye.

310
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,378
RACH: What happened?

311
00:21:54,378 --> 00:21:56,426
MNCA: Well we... we kinda broke up.

312
00:22:03,441 --> 00:22:05,409
MNCA:  Does anybody want these?

313
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:12,279
CHAN: I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.

314
00:22:15,486 --> 00:22:16,919
JOEY: Hey.

315
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,352
ROSS: How'd the callback go?

316
00:22:18,456 --> 00:22:22,358
JOEY: It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.

317
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,455
CHAN: So what'd you do?

318
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:26,410
JOEY: Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.

319
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,258
ROSS: Good for you.

320
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:33,495
JOEY: But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.

321
00:22:34,372 --> 00:22:35,361
PHOE: So... and?

322
00:22:35,406 --> 00:22:45,312
JOEY: Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!

323
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:47,407
JOEY: Alright... I've got to go shower. 

324
00:23:00,331 --> 00:23:01,827
RUSS: Hi.

325
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:03,323
CHAN: Oh, hey.

326
00:23:03,367 --> 00:23:05,363
RUSS: I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me.

327
00:23:05,363 --> 00:23:07,359
CHAN: Yeah, I'm sorry man.

328
00:23:07,438 --> 00:23:14,274
RUSS: Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about?

329
00:23:14,378 --> 00:23:21,251
PHOE: Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him.

330
00:23:21,352 --> 00:23:22,364
JULIE: Hey.

331
00:23:22,364 --> 00:23:25,352
PHOE: Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?

332
00:23:25,456 --> 00:23:34,456
JULIE: Um, oh, I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um....

333
00:23:42,273 --> 00:23:43,319
Have we met?

334
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:44,365
I don't think so.

335
00:23:44,475 --> 00:23:47,273
You look so familiar.

336
00:23:48,312 --> 00:23:50,411
Well, maybe we could talk about it

337
00:23:50,411 --> 00:23:52,510
over a cup of coffee.

338
00:23:53,284 --> 00:23:55,411
Know what? I'm sick of coffee.

339
00:23:55,486 --> 00:23:58,284
Let's go get us some juice.

340
00:23:58,322 --> 00:23:58,919
All right.

341
00:23:58,919 --> 00:23:59,516
Okay.

342
00:24:00,257 --> 00:24:01,354
Bye.

343
00:24:01,354 --> 00:24:02,451
Bye. LAUGH
