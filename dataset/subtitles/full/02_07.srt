1
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:09,469
Chandler: OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?

2
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:11,267
Rachel: So, how was the party?

3
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:17,477
Chandler: Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?

4
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:27,453
Phoebe: No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting.

5
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:33,261
Chandler: Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?

6
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,357
Did you want to...?

7
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,464
Phoebe: No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation.

8
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:47,504
Monica: Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you.

9
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:51,409
Chandler: Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time.

10
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:53,781
Monica: Please.

11
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:55,277
All: C'mon. Let her. Yeah.

12
00:00:55,388 --> 00:01:00,359
Chandler: Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home.

13
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:11,461
Phoebe: Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here.  Oh, can't make.... hands... meet....

14
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:15,423
Chandler: OK, let's do it.  What?

15
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:22,435
Monica: Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before. LAUGH

16
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,274
Chandler: And we're changing. 

17
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:44,462
Monica: C'mon give me five more. Five more. LAUGH

18
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:47,493
Monica: Five more and I'll flash you.

19
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:58,501
Chandler: One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them. LAUGH

20
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:27,429
Chandler: . She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore. LAUGH

21
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,365
Tell her to stop.

22
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,971
No, while she's unemployed

23
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:32,467
I'm all she's got.

24
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,861
Why don't we all pitch in

25
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:36,476
and buy her a restaurant?

26
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,452
Rachel: Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night? LAUGH

27
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:46,348
Phoebe: Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice.

28
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,807
Joey: The guy still won't put out, huh?

29
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:50,354
Phoebe: Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh.

30
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,457
All: Sorry Phoebs. LAUGH

31
00:03:53,399 --> 00:04:02,240
Phoebe: Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up? LAUGH

32
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:09,210
Joey: Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean.

33
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,417
Phoebe: No, whad'ya mean? He's not British.

34
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,321
Joey: Maybe he's. . . gay.

35
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:31,235
Phoebe: Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something.

36
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,429
Rachel: Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?

37
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,465
Phoebe: No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell. LAUGH

38
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,245
Monica:  Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes.

39
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,445
Chandler: Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it.

40
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,921
Phoebe:  Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look.

41
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:56,487
Rachel: What?  C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight.

42
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,412
Joey: Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?

43
00:04:58,412 --> 00:04:59,561
Rachel: Yeah, Monica's settin' me up.

44
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,424
Joey: But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?

45
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:10,401
Rachel: Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity.

46
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,505
Chandler: So you really OK about all this?

47
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:23,445
Rachel: Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on. He can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.

48
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,253
Ross: Hi guys.

49
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,352
Ross: Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?

50
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,323
Monica: Only if you say his full name.

51
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:39,270
Ross:  Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.

52
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:40,471
Monica: Alright. LAUGH

53
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,253
Joey:  You're getting a cat?

54
00:05:43,253 --> 00:05:45,232
Ross: Uh, actually, we're getting a cat.

55
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,241
Rachel: Together?

56
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,338
Rachel: Both of you?

57
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:53,250
Julie: Yeah, we figure it'll live with Ross half the time, and with me half the time.

58
00:05:53,386 --> 00:06:02,223
Rachel: Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time.

59
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,195
Ross: Hopefully.

60
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,810
Rachel: Well.  OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave.

61
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,323
I gotta go! I got a date!

62
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,231
With a man.

63
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:16,431
You guys have a really good night and you two have a really good cat. LAUGH

64
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,510
Rachel: Well.  OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave.

65
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:39,323
Michael: I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am.

66
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,426
Rachel:  How long do cats live? LAUGH

67
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,953
Michael:  I'm sorry?

68
00:06:44,953 --> 00:06:50,470
Rachel: Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something? LAUGH

69
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,957
Michael: Um, maybe 15, 16 years.

70
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:56,437
Rachel: That's just great. 

71
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,347
Michael: Um, cheers.

72
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,282
Rachel: Oh, right, clink. 

73
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:12,185
Michael: Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she? LAUGH

74
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:24,408
Rachel: Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend.

75
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,345
Michael: Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh.

76
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,208
Rachel: I mean he just started going out with her.

77
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,447
Michael: Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?

78
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:47,282
Rachel: Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you.

79
00:07:47,282 --> 00:07:49,233
Michael: Alright.

80
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:58,367
Rachel: OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend? LAUGH

81
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:00,861
Phoebe: So, I figured it out.

82
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:02,277
Joey: What?

83
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:07,377
Phoebe: Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.

84
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:16,218
Joey: Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, "Excellent butt, great rack."

85
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:27,394
Phoebe: Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet. LAUGH

86
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:32,471
Joey: Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him.

87
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:37,407
Phoebe: You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm. 

88
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,238
I mean, it's a cat, you know? LAUGH

89
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,206
It's a cat.

90
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,275
Why can't they get a bug?

91
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:06,175
Those fruit flies.

92
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,242
Those things that live for a day.

93
00:09:08,242 --> 00:09:10,272
Rachel:  What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?

94
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,396
Michael: Fruitflies? LAUGH

95
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:15,278
Rachel: Yes! Thank you.

96
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,272
Waiter: So, would you like any dessert?

97
00:09:17,272 --> 00:09:21,385
Michael: No! No dessert, just a check, please.

98
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,320
Rachel: Oh, you're not having fun, are you?

99
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:33,203
Michael: No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie _Diner_ in my head. LAUGH

100
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:51,221
Rachel: Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?

101
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,315
No! LAUGH

102
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,408
Too late for that, man.

103
00:09:56,408 --> 00:09:58,456
I've screwed this all up.

104
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:02,359
Rachel: Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?

105
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:11,275
Michael: Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure.

106
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:22,420
Rachel: Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?

107
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,354
How do I get that?

108
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:36,393
Michael: Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, "I'm over you."

109
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,402
Rachel: Closure, that's what it is. Closure. LAUGH

110
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:46,410
Rachel: Hello, excuse me.

111
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:47,892
Hang on. LAUGH

112
00:10:47,892 --> 00:10:48,404
Rachel: Hello, excuse me.

113
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,431
Guy: What.

114
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:53,577
Rachel: Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute.

115
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,379
Guy: I'm talkin'!

116
00:10:56,422 --> 00:11:06,228
Rachel: I can see that. I... just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself.  OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone. LAUGH

117
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,326
Guy: Alright, fine. 

118
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:26,901
Rachel: Thank you. OK.  Machine. Just waiting for the beep. LAUGH

119
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:28,351
Michael: Good.

120
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:32,482
Ross! Hi, it's Rachel.

121
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:37,512
I'm just calling to say that everything's fine,

122
00:11:37,512 --> 00:11:39,463
and I'm really happy for you.

123
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,267
And your cat.

124
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,431
Who, by the way, I think

125
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:46,461
you should name Michael.

126
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:55,405
See, I'm thinking of names so obviously I am over you.

127
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:58,506
I am over you.

128
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,786
And that, my friend,

129
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:04,254
is what they call ''closure.'' LAUGH

130
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:25,434
Chandler: No, no, no, no, no, no  No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday. LAUGH

131
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,928
Monica: Why not?

132
00:12:26,928 --> 00:12:30,476
Chandler: Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.

133
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:35,444
Monica: OK, if you say stop, then we stop. LAUGH

134
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,277
Chandler: OK, stop. LAUGH

135
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:45,294
Monica: No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo  Woo.

136
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,438
Ross: Hey Rach.

137
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,341
Ross: Oh. And how was the date?

138
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:12,349
Rachel: Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . .

139
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:23,232
Ross: Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?

140
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:31,341
Rachel: I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember.

141
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,472
Ross: OK. Oh, oh, oh. 

142
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,238
There they are.

143
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,474
Rachel: Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?

144
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:43,449
Ross: No, I stayed at Julie's last night.

145
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:48,292
Ross: Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?

146
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,294
Rachel: Oh yeah, go ahead. 

147
00:13:54,266 --> 00:14:02,270
Ross: Rach, I got a message from you.  Who's Michael?

148
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:10,339
Rachel: Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . . 

149
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,323
Ross: You're over me?

150
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,415
Rachel: Ohhhhhhhh God. 

151
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:22,222
Ross: Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?

152
00:14:22,222 --> 00:14:23,217
Oh, God.

153
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,263
Ross: Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?

154
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:46,314
Ross: When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What? LAUGH

155
00:14:46,314 --> 00:14:57,452
Rachel: Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you.

156
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,326
Ross: You've had feelings for me?

157
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,429
Rachel: Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first.

158
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:15,243
Ross: Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?

159
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,466
Rachel: Chandler told me.

160
00:15:18,466 --> 00:15:20,417
Ross: Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did he? LAUGH

161
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,313
Rachel: When you were in China.

162
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,325
Rachel: Meeting Julie.

163
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:48,472
Ross: Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me? LAUGH

164
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:53,283
Rachel: Are you over me?

165
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,194
That's Julie.

166
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,295
Ross:  Hi Julie.

167
00:16:07,295 --> 00:16:08,392
Julie:  Hi honey, I've got a cab waiting.

168
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,298
Ross:  I'll be right down.

169
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,305
Rachel: Wait, so, you're going?

170
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:27,214
Ross: Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat.

171
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:31,446
Ross: Cat. 

172
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,435
Phoebe: Hey Joey. LAUGH

173
00:16:49,435 --> 00:16:50,430
Joey: Hey Phoebs.

174
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:56,336
Phoebe: How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?

175
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:03,379
Joey: I can't find the remote.  Thank you. LAUGH

176
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:08,386
Phoebe: So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.

177
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,388
Phoebe: And we did.

178
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,743
Joey: All right Phoebs, way to go.

179
00:17:12,743 --> 00:17:14,290
Phoebe: Yay me.

180
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,196
Joey: So, so how did it happen?

181
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:20,238
Phoebe: Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.

182
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:21,329
Joey: And what did he say?

183
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:39,417
Phoebe: He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.

184
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:40,737
Joey: Wow.

185
00:17:40,737 --> 00:18:02,472
Phoebe: Yeah, so I said, "OK, relax please," y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.

186
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:19,196
Joey: Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.

187
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,294
Joey: This man is my God.

188
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,345
Oh, this one's cute.

189
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,415
Yeah, and this one, and that one.

190
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,445
They're all cute. They're kittens.

191
00:18:39,445 --> 00:18:41,441
Just wrap one up.

192
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,371
You okay? LAUGH

193
00:18:43,371 --> 00:18:44,321
Yeah, me?

194
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:47,325
Yeah, yeah. Yeah?

195
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,420
Ross, honey. Hey.

196
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,913
I know this is a big step,

197
00:18:52,913 --> 00:18:55,364
but I think we'll be okay.

198
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,329
Yeah, I know. I know.

199
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,804
So do you have any cats that are

200
00:19:01,804 --> 00:19:04,170
really old or incredibly sick? LAUGH

201
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,178
I don't want one that's about to die.

202
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:11,193
We should've worked that out

203
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:13,172
before we came down here. LAUGH

204
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,274
Okay, sweetie.

205
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:15,882
I'll narrow it down

206
00:19:15,882 --> 00:19:20,220
to this one here and this one with the stripes.

207
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,316
You pick.

208
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,224
Whoa, hey, I have to pick?

209
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,321
Yeah, whichever one you want.

210
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,391
Well, I don't know.

211
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:33,199
It's not that easy to choose.

212
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:41,335
Both cats are beautiful...and funny.

213
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:47,343
I'm sure I'd be happy with either cat.

214
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,800
Well, do you want to take both?

215
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,347
Both? Both!?

216
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:55,256
I can't have two cats!

217
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,295
Joey's the kind of guys

218
00:19:58,295 --> 00:20:00,229
who could have two cats.

219
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,533
Goodnight, Gunther.

220
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,810
Rachel: Hi.

221
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,374
Ross: I didn't get a cat.

222
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,475
Rachel: Oh, that's um, interesting.

223
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:29,283
Ross: No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.

224
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,453
Rachel: Alright, I got it Ross.

225
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:34,453
Ross: You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.

226
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:37,400
Ross: I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.

227
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:42,302
Rachel: Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?

228
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,365
Ross: Then you should have said something before I met her.

229
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:47,570
Rachel: I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.

230
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:49,507
Ross: There was never a good time.

231
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,376
Rachel: Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.

232
00:20:53,485 --> 00:21:09,357
Ross: Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.

233
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:15,238
Rachel: Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?

234
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:23,271
Ross: The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.

235
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,374
Rachel: Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?

236
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,352
Ross: Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.

237
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,254
Rachel: Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.

238
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,371
Rachel: 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.

239
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:34,451
Ross: Good.

240
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,287
Rachel: And ya know what, now I've got closure.

241
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,381
Ross: Try the bottom one. LAUGH

242
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:07,248
Chandler: Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.

243
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:14,257
Monica: No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.

244
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:24,234
Chandler: OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.

245
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:29,429
Monica: Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?

246
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:36,243
Chandler: Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.

247
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,246
Monica: Well, thanks.

248
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,478
Chandler: I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.

249
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,355
Monica: Well, you know.

250
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:51,388
Chandler: You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.

251
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:58,367
Chandler: And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.

252
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:00,396
Monica: Well no, but um.

253
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:06,233
Chandler: I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.

254
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,411
Monica: Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .

255
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:19,313
Chandler: So, you feel like goin' for a run?

256
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,224
Monica: Alright.

257
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:28,323
Chandler: Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.

258
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:33,820
Monica: OK. Just for a little while.

259
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,270
Chandler: OK. LAUGH
