1
00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:09,431
Rachel: Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.

2
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:29,453
Phoebe: Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go.  OK, thank you very much. LAUGH

3
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,502
Chandler: Oh, great. This is just...

4
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,497
Rachel: Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out! LAUGH

5
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:50,276
Monica: Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.

6
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:52,389
Rachel: Wow, you guys, this is big.

7
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:54,402
Pants and a sweater. Why, Mom?

8
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,306
Who will I meet in a blackout?

9
00:01:58,384 --> 00:01:59,868
Power-company guys?

10
00:01:59,868 --> 00:02:01,352
Eligible looters?

11
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,837
Can we talk about this later? Okay.

12
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:11,226
Phoebe: Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma.  What's my number?

13
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,433
Phoebe: Well, I never call me.

14
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:21,431
Chandler: _Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.

15
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,334
_Jill:  Hi Mom, it's Jill.

16
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:40,358
Chandler: _She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! __ Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!_

17
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:45,386
Jill:  Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule.

18
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:49,491
Chandler: _Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule._

19
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:56,372
Jill:  I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy.

20
00:02:56,476 --> 00:03:06,412
Chandler: _Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy. _

21
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,326
Joey: Hi everyone.

22
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:28,229
Ross: And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.

23
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:37,243
Joey: Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.

24
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:42,446
Phoebe:  Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.

25
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,254
Rachel: That had to hurt!

26
00:03:53,399 --> 00:04:03,202
Chandler: _Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!_

27
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,305
Chandler: _There you go!_

28
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,309
Chandler: _You're definitely scaring here._

29
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,227
Hello? Oh, hi, Mom.

30
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,326
Mom.

31
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,329
Mom, you're tripping!

32
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,780
Dexter's a dog.

33
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,327
The blackout's scaring him.

34
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,853
You'd pee in Dad's shoes too

35
00:04:32,853 --> 00:04:35,236
if you didn't know.

36
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,267
All right, call me back.

37
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:39,939
Mothers.

38
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:40,433
Yeah.

39
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,481
Attaboy! A word.

40
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,347
That wasn't so hard.

41
00:04:45,347 --> 00:04:46,444
Mothers. Yeah!

42
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,453
Mothers. Yeah! Perfect.

43
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,390
Don't smile.

44
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,552
Would you like to call somebody?

45
00:04:56,462 --> 00:05:07,236
Chandler: _Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with._ Yeah, thanks. 

46
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:11,756
Monica: Hello?

47
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:12,302
Chandler: Hey, it's me.

48
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,408
Monica:  Are you OK?

49
00:05:14,408 --> 00:05:25,247
Chandler: Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.

50
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:27,738
Monica: What?

51
00:05:27,738 --> 00:05:34,457
Chandler: I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!

52
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,532
Monica: I have no idea what you just said.

53
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,239
Chandler:  Put Joey on the phone.

54
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,405
Joey: What's up man?

55
00:05:44,405 --> 00:05:52,451
Chandler: I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.

56
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,442
Oh, my God!

57
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,818
He's trapped in an ATM vestibule

58
00:05:56,818 --> 00:05:58,348
with Jill Goodacre!

59
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,317
Chandler, listen.

60
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,197
Chandler: Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.

61
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:12,699
Okay.

62
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:13,193
Rachel: Alright, somebody.

63
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:19,243
Monica: OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.

64
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:20,941
Pool table?

65
00:06:20,941 --> 00:06:22,437
Ross: That's my sister.

66
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:32,419
Joey: OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.

67
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,456
Monica: Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?

68
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,846
Ross: Pheebs, what about you?

69
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:41,461
Phoebe: Oh... Milwaukee.

70
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,366
It's a really weird place.

71
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,469
Rachel: Um... Ross?

72
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,375
Ross: Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'

73
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,417
All: No way!

74
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:12,390
Ross: The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.

75
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,403
Let's see, that leaves....

76
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,887
Phoebe: Oh, Rachel.

77
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:20,337
Rachel: Oh come on, I already went.

78
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:21,321
Monica: You did not go!

79
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:22,236
I did.

80
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,309
All: Come on.

81
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:34,243
Rachel: Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed.

82
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,837
Ross: Step back.

83
00:07:36,837 --> 00:07:38,253
Joey: We have a winner!

84
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,246
This must be what the fridge

85
00:07:49,246 --> 00:07:51,259
looks like with the door closed.

86
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,334
Spooky.

87
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,388
Anybody hungry?

88
00:07:56,388 --> 00:07:58,436
We got a IKlondike...soup.

89
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:07,184
Rachel: I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.

90
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:13,385
Ross: Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.

91
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:19,286
Rachel: There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.

92
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:19,892
Ross: Come on.

93
00:08:19,892 --> 00:08:23,299
Rachel: No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.

94
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,294
Ross:  And you didn't marry him because...?

95
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:34,406
Rachel: I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...

96
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,379
Ross: Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.

97
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:36,311
Really?

98
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,475
Ross: Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.

99
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:40,833
Rachel: Yeah right.

100
00:08:40,833 --> 00:09:03,272
Ross: It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.

101
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,841
Rachel:  OK.

102
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:08,371
Ross: But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.

103
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,282
Rachel: You don't.

104
00:09:11,282 --> 00:09:14,799
Ross: Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.

105
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,312
Rachel: Really?

106
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:17,836
Rachel: You do?

107
00:09:17,836 --> 00:09:18,382
Ross: I do.

108
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:22,227
Rachel: Oh Ross, you're so great. 

109
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,229
Joey: It's never gonna happen.

110
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,242
Ross:  What?

111
00:09:42,242 --> 00:09:43,237
Joey: You and Rachel.

112
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,313
What--? Me and Ra--?

113
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,416
Ross:  Why not?

114
00:09:55,461 --> 00:10:01,332
Joey: Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.

115
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,448
Ross: No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.

116
00:10:04,448 --> 00:10:06,461
Joey: Ross, you're mayor of the zone.

117
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:16,280
Ross: I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...

118
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:23,344
Joey: Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.

119
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,936
She just ran her fingers

120
00:10:24,936 --> 00:10:26,483
through my hair.

121
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,874
Were you missing that interaction?

122
00:10:28,874 --> 00:10:30,455
No, no, no.

123
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,514
This is running fingers

124
00:10:32,514 --> 00:10:34,465
through your hair, okay?

125
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:38,293
Now this is a tousle.

126
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:44,366
Joey: Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.

127
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:54,348
Ross: I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment.  What? What, now?

128
00:10:54,348 --> 00:11:05,227
Joey: Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' 

129
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:07,863
What?

130
00:11:07,863 --> 00:11:12,368
Ross: We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen.  Don't you hear that?

131
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:14,422
What? What?

132
00:11:14,422 --> 00:11:16,373
Ross: We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen.  Don't you hear that?

133
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,536
Ross: See?

134
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,300
Jill: Would you like some gum?

135
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,346
Chandler: Um, is it sugarless?

136
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,371
Jill:  Sorry, it's not.

137
00:11:34,371 --> 00:11:47,498
Chandler: Oh, then no thanks. _What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it._

138
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:53,274
New York City has no power

139
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,507
And the milk is getting sour

140
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,318
But to me it is not scary

141
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,446
Because I stay away from dairy

142
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:14,796
Ross:  OK, here goes.

143
00:12:14,796 --> 00:12:15,359
Joey: Are you going to do it?

144
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,366
Ross: I'm going to do it.

145
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:17,264
Joey: Do you want any help?

146
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,361
Ross: You come out there, you're a dead man.

147
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:23,808
Joey: Good luck, man.

148
00:12:23,808 --> 00:12:30,327
Ross: Thanks.  OK.

149
00:12:30,327 --> 00:12:31,373
Joey: OK. 

150
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,370
Joey: Hey, where are you going?

151
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,287
Joey: You can't go out there.

152
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,325
Monica: Why not?

153
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:42,293
Joey: Because of... the reason.

154
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,379
Monica: And that would be?

155
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:47,262
Joey: I, um, can't tell you.

156
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,357
Monica: Joey, what's going on?

157
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:54,302
Joey: OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.

158
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,840
Monica: About what?

159
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,307
Joey: He's planning your birthday party.

160
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,808
Monica: Oh my God! I love him!

161
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:02,338
Joey:  You'd better act surprised.

162
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,813
Phoebe: About what?

163
00:13:03,813 --> 00:13:05,212
Monica: My surprise party!

164
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,285
Phoebe: What surprise party?

165
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:09,253
Monica: Oh stop it. Joey already told me.

166
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,320
Phoebe: Well, he didn't tell me.

167
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,522
Joey: Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.

168
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:18,355
Phoebe: This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.

169
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,421
Monica: No, you are not. We tell you stuff.

170
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:30,333
Phoebe: Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.  Looks like I was second to last.

171
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,365
What?

172
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,245
Phoebe: Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.  Looks like I was second to last.

173
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,442
You had a crush on me?

174
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,905
All right. It wasn't a crush,

175
00:13:44,905 --> 00:13:47,356
it was a dent.

176
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,554
Big dent?

177
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,827
You were moving your furniture.

178
00:13:52,827 --> 00:13:55,358
I thought you had nice arms.

179
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,396
Nice arms, huh?

180
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,208
Hey, Mon, I'm moving the chair.

181
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,403
Do anything for you?

182
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,228
With all the lights out

183
00:14:11,228 --> 00:14:13,241
you can actually see the stars.

184
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,252
Rachel: Hmmm... this is so nice.

185
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:30,459
Ross: OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.

186
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,449
Rachel: OK.

187
00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:42,245
Ross: OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....

188
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,397
Ross: Yes, yes, that's right...

189
00:14:45,397 --> 00:14:47,445
Rachel: Oh, look at the little cat! 

190
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,378
Ross: What?  Ow!

191
00:14:51,290 --> 00:15:08,197
Monica, Joey, and Phoebe:  _I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since..._

192
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,255
Monica:  This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.

193
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,806
Ow!

194
00:15:28,806 --> 00:15:30,353
Joey: Sorry, that was wax.

195
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:36,264
Phoebe: Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.

196
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,428
Ross: Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?

197
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:42,438
Rachel: During a blackout? He'd get trampled!

198
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,271
Ross:  Yeah?

199
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:49,447
Damage control. Get back to the gum.

200
00:15:50,249 --> 00:16:10,292
Chandler: You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection.  _'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself._

201
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:15,430
Phoebe:  Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?

202
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:26,247
Rachel: Oh.  Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.

203
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,411
Mr. Heckles: Er, yeah, it's mine.

204
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,354
Phoebe:  He seems to hate you. Are you sure?

205
00:16:32,354 --> 00:16:34,453
Mr. Heckles: Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat.

206
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,378
Phoebe: Wait a minute. What's his name?

207
00:16:37,378 --> 00:16:39,329
Mr. Heckles: Ehhhh... B-Buttons.

208
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,400
Rachel: Bob Buttons?

209
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,334
Mr. Heckles: Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.

210
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,431
Phoebe:  Oooh! You are a very bad man!

211
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,241
Mr. Heckles:  You owe me a cat.

212
00:16:56,382 --> 00:17:08,257
Rachel: Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...

213
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,347
Hi.

214
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:15,496
-Buona sera.

215
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,393
Rachel: Wow. 

216
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,738
Mon, wanna go for a ride

217
00:17:24,738 --> 00:17:26,234
in my racecar?

218
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,279
I'll bring my arms.

219
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,778
We can bring my wheelbarrow

220
00:17:30,778 --> 00:17:32,342
for your teeth!

221
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,255
Ross:  Lucky sixes....

222
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:45,422
Rachel:  Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.

223
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,448
Monica:  Hi!

224
00:17:46,448 --> 00:17:47,432
Rachel: And Joey....

225
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:48,950
Monica: Hi!

226
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,434
Rachel: And Ross.

227
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,294
Monica: Hi!

228
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,178
Rachel:  He doesn't speak much English.

229
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,215
Paolo:  _Monopoly_!

230
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,248
Rachel: Look at that!

231
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,188
Ross:  So, um... where did Paolo come from?

232
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,419
Rachel: Oh... Italy, I think.

233
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:18,389
Ross: No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.

234
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,782
Rachel: Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!

235
00:18:21,782 --> 00:18:24,233
Isn't that funny?

236
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:29,305
Ross: That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him.

237
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:36,236
Phoebe: Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.

238
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,442
Rachel: Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.

239
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:47,222
Phoebe: Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.

240
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,361
Rachel: Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.

241
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,425
Phoebe:  You betcha!

242
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:11,307
Chandler:  _Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go._

243
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:32,398
Chandler: _Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth._ 

244
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:48,446
Chandler: _Good save! We're back on track, and I'm..._  _..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking._

245
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,255
Jill: Are you alright?

246
00:19:54,326 --> 00:20:02,800
Jill: My God, you're choking!  That better?

247
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,904
Chandler:  Yes... thank you. That was... that was....

248
00:20:07,904 --> 00:20:09,337
Jill: Perfection?

249
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,295
That was no tousle.

250
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,767
Ross: Wha-What did he say that was so funny?

251
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:43,264
Rachel: I have absolutely no idea.

252
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,276
Ross: That's... that's classic.

253
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:49,369
Rachel:  Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!

254
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,473
Monica: If you want, I'll do it.

255
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:58,381
Phoebe: I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip.  But I won't.

256
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:06,219
Rachel: God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.

257
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:14,336
Phoebe: You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.

258
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:22,469
Rachel: Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....

259
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,902
Ross: Paolo. Hi.

260
00:21:28,902 --> 00:21:30,352
Paolo: Ross!

261
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:45,300
Ross: Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.

262
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,886
Paolo: Thing?

263
00:21:46,886 --> 00:21:48,302
Ross: Thing, yes. Thing.

264
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,986
Paolo: Ah, you... have the sex?

265
00:21:49,986 --> 00:22:11,319
Ross: No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...

266
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,380
Paolo: Bed?

267
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:25,274
Ross: No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.

268
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:36,300
Ross: So you do know a little English.

269
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,348
Paolo: Poco... a leetle.

270
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,357
Ross: Do you know the word _crapweasel_?

271
00:22:40,357 --> 00:22:42,257
Paolo: No.

272
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,491
Ross: That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!

273
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:54,497
Jill: Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy.

274
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,365
Jill: Ready? 

275
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,412
Okay? Now try it.

276
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,316
Jill: No, you've got to whip it.

277
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:14,224
Phoebe: Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... 

278
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:20,898
Ten, nine, eight, seven minus 46, minus 47,

279
00:23:20,898 --> 00:23:23,366
minus 48....

280
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,264
Ross: Thank you.

281
00:23:25,264 --> 00:23:26,259
Phoebe: Thanks.

282
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:30,432
Ross: Kinda... spooky without any lights.

283
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:40,383
Ross: OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...

284
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:59,566
Joey: Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.

285
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:08,810
Jill: Well, this has been fun.

286
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:15,413
Chandler: Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.

287
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:23,251
Jill: Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout.  See ya.

288
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:48,276
Chandler: Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape. LAUGH
