00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:13,438
PHOEBE: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls.

00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:18,442
JOEY: Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year? LAUGH

3
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:22,351
CHANDLER: Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad.

4
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,855
MONICA: Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies.

CHANDLER: And twenty-five it is. LAUGH

6
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:30,758
JOEY: You gave him cookies?

7
00:00:30,758 --> 00:00:39,302
MONICA: Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that.

8
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:43,502
PHOEBE: I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick. LAUGH

9
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:49,378
CHANDLER: Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?

10
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:54,411
PHOEBE: Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them. LAUGH

11
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:00,417
ROSS: So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?

12
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:03,257
RACHEL: Uhh, the mailman, the super.

13
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:06,455
MONICA: Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.

14
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,234
JOEY: Oh my God.

15
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,351
RACHEL: What?

16
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:13,433
JOEY: Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this.

17
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:19,376
RACHEL: Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section. LAUGH

18
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,380
MONICA: Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle.

19
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:29,448
ROSS: Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme.

20
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:27,369
JOEY: I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'.

21
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:32,341
CHANDLER: Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year. LAUGH

22
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,366
ROSS: Hey guys.

23
00:02:34,366 --> 00:02:35,446
CHANDLER, MONICA, and JOEY: Hey.

29
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,372

00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,443
ROSS: Hey guys.

00:03:18,443 --> 00:03:19,523
CHANDLER, MONICA, and JOEY: Hey.

ROSS: Um, just some presents.

35
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:29,341
JOEY: C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.

36
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:36,473
ROSS:  OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh. LAUGH

37
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,376
MONICA: Cute.

MONICA: Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe military academy. LAUGH

41
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,772
PHOEBE: Happy Christmas Eve Eve.  Oh my God, where did you get this?

42
00:04:03,772 --> 00:04:05,302
You too. LAUGH

43
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,403
PHOEBE: Happy Christmas Eve Eve.  Oh my God, where did you get this?

44
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:10,306
ROSS: Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.

00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:14,512
PHOEBE: This is my father, this is a picture of my dad.

46
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,451
CHANDLER: Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame. LAUGH

47
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,318
PHOEBE: No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you.

48
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,396
RACHEL: Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison.

49
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:30,424
PHOEBE: No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born.

50
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,371
RACHEL: How have you never been on Oprah? LAUGH

51
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:40,472
PHOEBE:  OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she died, same guy.

52
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:48,447
MONICA: Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie. LAUGH

53
00:04:49,289 --> 00:05:00,297
PHOEBE: It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother. 

54
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,896
MONICA: Oh, wait a minute honey. LAUGH

55
00:05:01,896 --> 00:05:03,392
GANG: Phoebs. 

56
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:11,209
JOEY: So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . .

57
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,335
GANG: Joey! LAUGH

58
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:17,312
JOEY: Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!

59
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:24,246
GRANDMOTHER: Esther Livingston.  Gone. LAUGH

60
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,224
GRANDMOTHER: Hi, Phoe.

61
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,319
PHOEBE: Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?

62
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,366
GRANDMOTHER: Oh, just updating the phonebook.

63
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:39,226
PHOEBE: Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?

64
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:45,875
GRANDMOTHER:  Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?

65
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,473
PHOEBE: Just, you know, to see... um.

66
00:05:48,247 --> 00:06:11,201
GRANDMOTHER: Oh, sure, yeah.  This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation. LAUGH

67
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,206
PHOEBE: OK, is this really my father? LAUGH

68
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:19,435
GRANDMOTHER: Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.

69
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:25,349
PHOEBE: OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire.

70
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,224
PHOEBE: Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me.

71
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:37,421
GRANDMOTHER: Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame.

72
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,227
PHOEBE: Oh God.

73
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:58,374
GRANDMOTHER: It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she died and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder.

74
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:10,490
PHOEBE: Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?

75
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:14,425
GRANDMOTHER: Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.

76
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:20,195
PHOEBE: OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?

77
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,402
GRANDMOTHER: Honey.

78
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,211
PHOEBE:  Oh.

79
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:44,262
GRANDMOTHER: Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this.  This is the real him.

80
00:07:49,335 --> 00:08:03,405
CHANDLER: Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up.

81
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,209
RACHEL: Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas.

82
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,379
CHANDLER: Who said anything about Christmas?

83
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,758
MONICA: Hi.

84
00:08:13,758 --> 00:08:15,225
ROSS: Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?

85
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,386
RACHEL: No, nothin'.

86
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,811
MONICA: I hope she's OK.

87
00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:20,426
JOEY: Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through.

88
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,191
MONICA: How do you know exactly what she's going through?

89
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,395
JOEY: She told us.

90
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:29,803
CHANDLER: So whaddya got there Monica?

91
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:31,299
MONICA: Just some stuff for the party.

00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,310
ROSS: Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?

93
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:39,249
MONICA: You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?

94
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:43,310
CHANDLER: Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?

95
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:50,352
RACHEL: Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent. 

96
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:57,464
MONICA: Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough.

97
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,297
JOEY: Monica, pigeons learn faster that you.

98
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:16,287
ROSS: Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me.

99
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,291
RACHEL: Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . .

100
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:37,435
RACHEL: OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.

101
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:45,411
ROSS: See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said.

102
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:51,411
RACHEL: Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross. 

103
00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:14,439
PHOEBE: Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information. 

104

PHOEBE: Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name.

105
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:31,359
GRANDMOTHER: C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?

106
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:37,492
PHOEBE: Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math.

107
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:51,476
GRANDMOTHER: Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin.

108
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:56,478
PHOEBE: No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know.

109
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:09,426
GRANDMOTHER: I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived.

110
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,333
PHOEBE: Whattaya mean?

111
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:22,442
GRANDMOTHER: He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far. You can take my cab.

112
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:26,247
PHOEBE: Wow. Thank you.

113
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,449
GRANDMOTHER: Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab.

114
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:42,265
PHOEBE: Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa!

JOEY: Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7.

118
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:11,320
CHANDLER: Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time.

119
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,294
JOEY: Hey, here she comes.

120
00:12:13,294 --> 00:12:14,357
Chandler: Hey.

121
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:26,467
PHOEBE: Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk.

122
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,394
JOEY: Yeah, big stuff.

123
00:12:29,394 --> 00:12:31,242
PHOEBE: OK, let's go.

124
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,251
PHOEBE: Alright, here, you have to hold this. 

125
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,446
CHANDLER: OK.  Brake left, gas right?

126
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:42,292
PHOEBE: Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet.

127
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:45,947
CHANDLER:  Where's my seat belt?

128
00:12:45,947 --> 00:12:50,401
PHOEBE: Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it. 

129
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,216
ROSS: C'mon, just tell me, please, please.

130
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:09,309
MONICA: For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive.

131
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,417
RACHEL: Oh, gosh, it's hot in here.

132
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,360
MONICA: Rach, get the heat.  Ross, could you turn the heat down please?

133
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,345
ROSS: Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . .

134
00:13:18,345 --> 00:13:20,262
MONICA: Ross, the heat!

Okay. This way is on.

00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:35,345
So this is...off.

138
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,845
RACHEL: Did you just break the radiator?

139
00:13:38,845 --> 00:13:43,455
ROSS: No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is.

140
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,349
MONICA: Well put it back.

141
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,828
ROSS: It uhh, it won't go back.

142
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:52,295
RACHEL: I'll call the super.

143
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,490
MONICA: Here, let me try.

144
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:58,362
ROSS: Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.

145
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,337
MONICA: Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny.

00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:24,455
RACHEL:  Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, _somebody_, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight.

147
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,357
ROSS: OK, tip the man.

148
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:34,534
MONICA: No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party.

149
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:39,232

00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:46,470
ROSS:  It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much?

175
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:12,320
MR. TREEGER: No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday.

MONICA: So, wait, you really did like my cookies?

184
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:52,360
MR. TREEGER: Oh, yeah, they were so personal, really showed you cared.

00:17:56,442 --> 00:18:00,309
RACHEL: Nice seizing. . . gel boy.

00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:58,462

00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:18,221
PHOEBE: Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter.

00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,191
CHANDLER: Well, so why not go knock?

199
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:48,243
PHOEBE: Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.

200
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:53,423
JOEY: Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today.

201
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:55,391
PHOEBE: Yeah?

202
00:19:55,391 --> 00:20:00,364
CHANDLER: Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.

203
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:04,232
JOEY: Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.

204
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:11,441
PHOEBE: You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.

205
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:15,344
CHANDLER: Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out.

206
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:32,261
JOEY: Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas.

207
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:44,465
CHANDLER: Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!

208
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,280
JOEY: Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?

209
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,475
MONICA: Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier.

210
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,508
ROSS: Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go.

211
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,278
PHOEBE: Oh, I couldn't go in.

212
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:58,351
MONICA: Honey, I'm sorry.

213
00:20:58,351 --> 00:20:59,380
ROSS: Are you OK?

214
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:04,329
PHOEBE: Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now.

215
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,455
CHANDLER: Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone. 

216
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:11,327
Oh, right! Merry Christmas!

217
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:18,368
JOEY: Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright.

218
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,381
Thanks.

219
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,469
I guess that just leaves the gifts

220
00:21:33,469 --> 00:21:35,448
from Joey and Chandler.

221
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,464
JOEY: Rach, these are for you.

222
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:44,457
RACHEL: Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.

223
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:49,262
JOEY: No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.

224
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,268
CHANDLER: OK, Phoebs, your turn.

225
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:08,317
PHOEBE: Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?

226
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:12,321
JOEY: And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.

227
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,368
ROSS: You got me a cola drink?

228
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,371
CHANDLER: And, a lemon lime.

229
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:27,334
ROSS: Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.

230
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,349
CHANDLER: And last but not least.

231
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,481
JOEY: They're ribbed for your pleasure. LAUGH
