1
00:00:57,431 --> 00:00:59,228
Chandler: No-no-no-no, we're done.

2
00:01:47,415 --> 00:02:00,452
Monica: Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna.  Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape. LAUGH

3
00:02:01,462 --> 00:02:04,396
Joey: Ross, did you really read all these baby books? LAUGH

4
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:12,331
Ross: Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that! 

5
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:19,272
Phoebe: Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta. 

6
00:02:21,215 --> 00:02:23,274
Chandler: And, we're done with the yogurt. LAUGH

7
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:33,385
Monica: Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas?  You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?

8
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:36,388
Nice talk, Aunt Silv.

9
00:02:37,298 --> 00:02:39,424
Monica: Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas?  You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth? LAUGH

10
00:02:40,434 --> 00:02:48,197
Joey: Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big?  Hi Daddy!

11
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:49,398
Ross:  Hello! LAUGH

12
00:02:50,244 --> 00:02:53,213
''How come you don't live with Mommy?''

13
00:02:54,415 --> 00:02:55,911
''How come Mommy lives

14
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:57,407
with that other lady?''

15
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:04,280
''What's a lesbian?'' LAUGH

16
00:03:09,296 --> 00:03:11,355
Honey, you can say it. Poconos. LAUGH

17
00:03:11,465 --> 00:03:16,266
Poconos. It's like ''poke a nose.''

18
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:21,264
Paolo: Ah, poke 

19
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:30,799
Monica: So, did I hear Poconos? LAUGH

20
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,379
Rachel: Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.

21
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,384
Phoebe: Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!

22
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:38,823
Monica: Yeah, that's a big step.

23
00:03:38,823 --> 00:03:40,222
Rachel: I know...

24
00:03:41,228 --> 00:03:43,276
Chandler:  Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!

25
00:03:43,276 --> 00:03:49,334
Ross: Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?

26
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:59,410
Rachel: I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...

27
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:07,184
Ross: ...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration?  I could call immigration!

28
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:09,451
l could call Immigration.

29
00:04:15,162 --> 00:04:16,254
What? LAUGH

30
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,748
Ugly Naked Guy is making

31
00:04:18,748 --> 00:04:20,198
shadow puppets.

32
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:23,466
Look, it's Abraham Lincoln.

33
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,398
Oh, right!

34
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,369
Go. Go!

35
00:04:35,182 --> 00:04:42,411
Joey: I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...

36
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,318
Chandler: Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!

37
00:04:56,403 --> 00:04:58,200
Joey: Need a new table. LAUGH

38
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,168
Chandler: You think?

39
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:08,276
Carol: Hey hey, come on in!

40
00:05:08,276 --> 00:05:15,185
Ross: Hey, hello! mmwa!  I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.

41
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:19,248
Carol: Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat.

42
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:23,354
Ross:  I'm pretty sure that it is...

43
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:30,220
Nineteen weeks, the breasts

44
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,171
are starting to swell.

45
00:05:33,274 --> 00:05:35,299
According to the literature.

46
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,327
Carol: So, I got the results of the amnio today.

47
00:05:37,327 --> 00:05:39,278
Ross:  Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?

48
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,376
Carol: Totally and completely healthy!

49
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:43,372
Ross: Oh, that's great, that is great! 

50
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:51,383
Ross: Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?

51
00:05:52,192 --> 00:05:54,183
Carol: Uh, that's our friend Tanya.

52
00:06:03,337 --> 00:06:06,135
Of course, it's your friend Tanya.

53
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,210
Carol: Don't you want to know about the sex?

54
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,178
The sex?

55
00:06:13,347 --> 00:06:15,747
I'm having enough trouble with

56
00:06:15,747 --> 00:06:18,147
the image of you and Susan together.

57
00:06:18,185 --> 00:06:20,244
But when you throw in Tanya....

58
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,283
Carol: The sex of the baby, Ross.

59
00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:29,352
Ross: Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!

60
00:06:31,198 --> 00:06:31,778
Carol: Do you want to know?

61
00:06:31,778 --> 00:06:42,368
Ross: No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is!  Or isn't...

62
00:06:45,312 --> 00:06:46,358
Susan: Oh, hello Ross!

63
00:06:46,358 --> 00:06:47,404
Ross: Susan...

64
00:06:48,215 --> 00:06:51,179
Susan: So, so, did you hear?

65
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,275
Ross: Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!

66
00:06:53,387 --> 00:07:00,158
Susan: Oh, that's so...  It really is...do we know...?

67
00:07:00,327 --> 00:07:03,261
Carol: Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be...

68
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:08,265
Ross:  Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!

69
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,362
Susan: Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?

70
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:23,282
Ross: Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?

71
00:07:24,251 --> 00:07:28,381
Ross:  No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go.

72
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:30,820
Carol: Well, thanks for the books.

73
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,384
Ross: No problem, ok, mmmwa 

74
00:07:36,163 --> 00:07:47,169
Susan: All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona? 

75
00:07:50,477 --> 00:07:52,206
Carol: Hello?

76
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:55,293
Never mind.

77
00:07:55,293 --> 00:07:56,305
I don't wanna know.

78
00:07:57,384 --> 00:08:01,150
Chandler: Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?

79
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:03,189
Joey: That's the rule.

80
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:06,789
Chandler: What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!

81
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:08,353
Joey: How'd you get to that?

82
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:14,123
Chandler: Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio

83
00:08:14,268 --> 00:08:16,133
Joey: You knew about that?

84
00:08:16,236 --> 00:08:20,262
Chandler: Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.

85
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:23,175
Joey: Ok, ok, How about if we split it?

86
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:25,674
Chandler: What do you mean, like, buy it together?

87
00:08:25,674 --> 00:08:27,170
Joey: Yeah

88
00:08:27,347 --> 00:08:29,360
Chandler: You think we're ready for something like that?

89
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,373
Joey: Why not?

90
00:08:32,152 --> 00:08:36,144
Chandler: Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?

91
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,185
Joey: Why, are you moving out?

92
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:38,180
Chandler: I'm not moving out.

93
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:39,338
Joey: You'd tell me if you were moving out right

94
00:08:39,338 --> 00:08:43,226
Chandler: Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...

95
00:08:43,226 --> 00:08:45,291
Joey: Aw, I know all about Kip!

96
00:08:45,365 --> 00:08:50,359
Chandler: It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.

97
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:55,369
Joey: Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?

98
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:57,404
Chandler: Aw, don't do that

99
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:12,248
Phoebe's Assistant: We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.

100
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:13,348
Phoebe: Ok, thanks. 

101
00:09:14,228 --> 00:09:20,165
Phoebe's Assistant: Oh, here comes your 3:00. I don't mean to sound unprofessional, but, yum 

102
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:27,230
Phoebe: Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?

103
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:34,247
Paolo: Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh?

104
00:09:35,148 --> 00:09:37,173
Phoebe: Well, Racquela's right, yeah!

105
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:46,350
Phoebe: Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started.

106
00:09:48,262 --> 00:09:52,255
Paolo: Uh, I am, uh, being naked?

107
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:59,363
Phoebe: Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!

108
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:08,213
Rachel:  I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....

109
00:10:08,382 --> 00:10:10,179
Monica: And Monica knows...

110
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:13,183
Ross: Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!

111
00:10:13,287 --> 00:10:16,381
Monica: Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.

112
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,418
Joey: So what's it gonna be? 

113
00:10:22,195 --> 00:10:24,260
Ross: Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!

114
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,325
Monica: I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!

115
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,233
Joey: Or an uncle...

116
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,369
Joey and Chandler: Hey Phoebe!

117
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:35,398
Ross: Hi Pheebs!

118
00:10:35,442 --> 00:10:36,431
Phoebe: Fine!

119
00:10:40,213 --> 00:10:41,811
Monica: Phoebe, what's the matter?

120
00:10:41,811 --> 00:10:43,409
Phoebe: Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.

121
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,468
Well, you can use some of my sorts.

122
00:10:45,468 --> 00:10:47,419
l rarely use them.

123
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:50,347
Customer: Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?

124
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:53,419
Rachel: Oh, right, that's me!

125
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:58,321
Joey: Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.

126
00:10:58,432 --> 00:10:59,456
Chandler: Fine. 

127
00:11:01,368 --> 00:11:02,392
Monica: Phoebe, what is it?

128
00:11:04,204 --> 00:11:06,183
Phoebe: All right, you know Paolo?

129
00:11:06,183 --> 00:11:08,162
Ross: I'm familiar with his work, yes...

130
00:11:09,276 --> 00:11:11,176
Phoebe: Well, he made a move on me.

131
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:12,842
Joey: Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!

132
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:14,406
Chandler: More coffee over here, please!

133
00:11:16,383 --> 00:11:18,180
Monica: Well, what happened?

134
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:22,277
Phoebe: Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until. 

135
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:27,360
Joey and Chandler:  Ooooohh!

136
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,327
Monica: Are you sure?

137
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,221
Phoebe: Oh yeah, I'm sure. 

138
00:11:36,203 --> 00:11:38,199
And all of a sudden, his hands

139
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,195
weren't the problem anymore.

140
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:45,300
Monica: Was it...?

141
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:48,404
Phoebe: Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.

142
00:11:52,352 --> 00:11:53,341
Guys: Oooooo....

143
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:55,387
What did you do?

144
00:11:55,387 --> 00:11:57,321
l dealt with it like a professional.

145
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:05,262
Rachel: "Ooo," what?

146
00:12:05,365 --> 00:12:06,354
Phoebe: Uma Thurman.

147
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:07,814
Ross: The actress!

148
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:09,162
Uma Thurman!

149
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,259
Ross: Thanks Rach.

150
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:15,320
Chandler: So what are you gonna do?

151
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:22,370
Ross: You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? 

152
00:12:23,183 --> 00:12:24,730
Chandler: Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.

153
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,277
Joey: Feminist issue. That's where I went!

154
00:12:28,321 --> 00:12:29,805
Phoebe: She is gonna hate me.

155
00:12:29,805 --> 00:12:31,289
Ross: Yeah, well...

156
00:12:38,398 --> 00:12:43,230
Joey: Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? 

157
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,226
Chandler: That's patio furniture!

158
00:12:45,405 --> 00:12:50,239
Joey: So what, like people are gonna come in and think, "Uh-oh, I'm outside again?" Of course!

159
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,299
Fine.

160
00:12:52,212 --> 00:12:53,338
Chandler:  What about the birds?

161
00:12:54,514 --> 00:12:59,416
Joey: I don't know, birds just don't say, "Hello, sit here, eat something."

162
00:13:00,387 --> 00:13:01,883
Chandler: You pick one.

163
00:13:01,883 --> 00:13:03,379
Joey: All right, how about the ladybugs?

164
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:08,251
Chandler: Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!

165
00:13:08,361 --> 00:13:10,409
Joey: Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!

166
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:12,457
Chandler: Not like that, I won't! 

167
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:18,262
Kip would have liked the birds.

168
00:13:29,216 --> 00:13:30,211
Rachel: Hi Pheebs!

169
00:13:30,211 --> 00:13:31,206
What's going on?

170
00:13:31,284 --> 00:13:33,235
Phoebe: Are you moving out?

171
00:13:33,235 --> 00:13:35,186
I'm getting ready for the weekend.

172
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:37,839
Are your weekends longer

173
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,289
than two days?

174
00:13:40,227 --> 00:13:43,387
Rachel: No, these aren't all my suitcases.  This one's Paolo's.

175
00:13:47,234 --> 00:13:49,213
Phoebe: Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?

176
00:13:49,213 --> 00:13:53,399
Rachel: Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.

177
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:08,348
We haven't known each other that long.

178
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:09,838
There are three things

179
00:14:09,838 --> 00:14:11,288
you should know:

180
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:13,791
One, my friends are the most

181
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,191
important thing in my life.

182
00:14:16,296 --> 00:14:18,264
Two, l never lie.

183
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,229
And three, l make the best

184
00:14:21,229 --> 00:14:23,259
oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.

185
00:14:25,372 --> 00:14:28,307
Okay. Thanks, Pheebs.

186
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,796
Rachel:  Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!

187
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:36,212
l know.

188
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:38,375
Rachel:  Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!

189
00:14:38,418 --> 00:14:43,378
Phoebe: Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies

190
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:52,421
Rachel: All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.

191
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:54,814
Phoebe: Which proves that I never lie.

192
00:14:54,814 --> 00:14:56,395
Rachel: I guess you don't.

193
00:14:57,304 --> 00:14:59,397
Phoebe: Paolo made a pass at me.

194
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:03,234
Chandler: So, what do you think?

195
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:06,244
Ross: I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.

196
00:15:06,346 --> 00:15:07,335
Chandler: I know!

197
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:10,342
Monica: So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?

198
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:13,345
Joey: Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!

199
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:19,450
Monica: Heads up Ross!  You suck!

200
00:15:23,196 --> 00:15:24,254
Phoebe: Are you okay?

201
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,392
Rachel: I need some milk.

202
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,361
Phoebe: Ok, I've got milk  Better?

203
00:15:37,377 --> 00:15:39,174
Here you go.

204
00:15:47,387 --> 00:15:49,184
Phoebe: Ok, I've got milk  Better?

205
00:15:50,390 --> 00:16:09,267
Rachel: No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all "Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..." Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!

206
00:16:09,376 --> 00:16:13,244
Phoebe: I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!

207
00:16:13,244 --> 00:16:15,144
l unleashed him on you.

208
00:16:15,181 --> 00:16:17,149
If l had never met him--

209
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:21,376
Rachel and Phoebe: I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!

210
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:23,268
Phoebe: No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?

211
00:16:23,268 --> 00:16:26,391
Rachel: I don't know...right, he's the pig!

212
00:16:27,193 --> 00:16:28,290
Phoebe: Such a pig!

213
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,387
Rachel: Oh, God, he's such a pig,

214
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:33,291
Phoebe: Oh he's like a...

215
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,782
Rachel: ...pig...pig man!

216
00:16:34,782 --> 00:16:36,164
Phoebe: Yes, good! Ok...

217
00:16:40,273 --> 00:16:46,368
Rachel:  Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?

218
00:16:48,281 --> 00:16:49,305
Oh, l know!

219
00:16:52,385 --> 00:16:59,287
Phoebe:  It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...

220
00:16:59,287 --> 00:17:00,350
Rachel: Ok, Ok, Pheebs...

221
00:17:01,127 --> 00:17:02,253
Phoebe: The end.

222
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:06,120
Rachel: Oh, God...

223
00:17:08,134 --> 00:17:10,125
Phoebe: Should I not have told you?

224
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:21,235
Rachel: No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...

225
00:17:38,198 --> 00:17:42,156
Phoebe: I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...

226
00:17:42,302 --> 00:17:44,332
Monica: We should get over there and see if she's okay. 

227
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:46,362
Just one second.

228
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,254
Score!

229
00:17:49,254 --> 00:17:50,300
Game! Nice!

230
00:17:52,412 --> 00:17:54,175
Come on, Pheebs.

231
00:17:55,382 --> 00:17:58,374
Ross:  Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.

232
00:17:58,418 --> 00:18:03,116
Joey: No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.

233
00:18:03,156 --> 00:18:04,248
Ross: Come on, two on one.

234
00:18:04,357 --> 00:18:09,420
Chandler: What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!

235
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,780
Ross: What, now?

236
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:22,239
Joey: Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!

237
00:18:24,177 --> 00:18:34,381
Chandler: My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! 

238
00:18:41,361 --> 00:18:42,811
See this? See?

239
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:44,261
Hold it! Ascolta!

240
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:48,362
Ross:  How's it going?

241
00:18:48,362 --> 00:19:02,213
Monica: Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, "How could you?" or, "Enormous breasts!" Here he comes!

242
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:16,158
Paolo: Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye.

243
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:18,160
Phoebe: Oh, ok bye-bye.

244
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:30,141
Monica: Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel,  but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.

245
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,374
Ross: Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say... 

246
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:48,193
Phoebe: Oh, just look at her... 

247
00:19:48,294 --> 00:19:52,243
Ross: Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...

248
00:19:52,243 --> 00:19:53,289
Monica: Oh, you're right.

249
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:56,199
Ross:  ...and I really think it should be me.

250
00:20:13,186 --> 00:20:14,278
Ross: You all right?

251
00:20:15,288 --> 00:20:17,222
Rachel: Ooh, I've been better...

252
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:20,292
l don't believe this.

253
00:20:21,227 --> 00:20:22,723
l wasn't supposed to care

254
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:24,219
about this guy.

255
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:26,748
It was just supposed to be

256
00:20:26,748 --> 00:20:29,199
this big, fun, ltalian thing.

257
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:31,915
Someday l could look back and say,

258
00:20:31,915 --> 00:20:34,395
''That was a big, fun, ltalian thing.''

259
00:20:36,242 --> 00:20:37,840
It wasn't supposed to feel

260
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,438
like this when it was over.

261
00:20:42,315 --> 00:21:02,167
Ross: Come here.  Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.

262
00:21:05,405 --> 00:21:06,394
Ross: What?

263
00:21:07,407 --> 00:21:19,208
Rachel: I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy. 

264
00:21:26,226 --> 00:21:28,421
Rachel: Oh Ross, you're so great!

265
00:21:40,306 --> 00:21:41,352
Monica: Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?

266
00:21:41,352 --> 00:21:42,398
Phoebe: You ok?

267
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:44,807
Rachel: ...medium...hmm...any cookies left?

268
00:21:44,807 --> 00:21:46,405
Phoebe: Yep!

269
00:21:49,449 --> 00:22:00,248
Ross: See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.

270
00:22:02,262 --> 00:22:06,779
Rachel: No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want

271
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:13,305
Ross: Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.

272
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:20,174
Rachel: No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.

273
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,175
Ross:  What?

274
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:23,170
Rachel: What?

275
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,182
Ross: I-I'm, I'm having a boy?

276
00:22:28,187 --> 00:22:33,384
Rachel: Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.

277
00:22:34,294 --> 00:22:39,348
Ross: Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy!  Huh, am I having a boy?

278
00:22:39,348 --> 00:22:41,299
Girls: Yes, you're having a boy! 

279
00:22:41,434 --> 00:22:44,298
Ross: I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!

280
00:22:44,298 --> 00:22:45,293
Joey and Chandler: What is it?

281
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:48,237
Ross: I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!

282
00:22:52,211 --> 00:22:53,405
Joey and Chandler: We already knew that! 

283
00:22:57,216 --> 00:22:58,410
Ross: I'm having a son. Um...

284
00:23:06,392 --> 00:23:09,293
Monica: Yes! And that would be a shut-down!

285
00:23:09,362 --> 00:23:10,386
Joey and Chandler: Shut-out!! 

286
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:17,168
Monica: Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!

287
00:23:17,203 --> 00:23:18,733
Joey: Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!

288
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:20,263
Chandler: Yeah, get out!

289
00:23:20,473 --> 00:23:34,410
Monica: You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies!  and I'm gone.

290
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,312
I'm going.

291
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,282
Monica: You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies!  and I'm gone.

292
00:23:41,227 --> 00:23:42,211
Chandler:  One more game?

293
00:23:42,211 --> 00:23:43,195
Joey: Oh yeah! LAUGH
