00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:03,459
Stocks and bonds are moving higher....

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:06,431
JOEY: Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,438
MONICA: 'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting.

4
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,958
Sometimes it takes hours to come up

5
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:16,438
again but when it does, it's exciting.

6
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:21,447

10
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,883
PHOEBE: No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name.

11
00:00:35,883 --> 00:00:40,868
today I keep getting signs telling me to see my father. When I

12
00:00:40,868 --> 00:00:43,365
was walking over, I passed a ''buffet.''

13
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,471
Which is my father's last name.

14
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:53,513
PHOEBE: And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken. LAUGH

15
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,339
And there was a rotisserie

MONICA: His indian name? LAUGH

18
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:09,301
PHOEBE: No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.

19
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:11,269
Coincidences? I don't think so.

20
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,321
ROSS: Freakish. LAUGH

21
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:13,271
MONICA: Weird, weird.

22
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,273
RACHEL: Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?

23
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,434
PHOEBE: Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him.

24
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:19,307
MONICA: Why?

25
00:01:19,307 --> 00:01:27,250
PHOEBE: Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist. LAUGH

Yes.

29
00:01:34,343 --> 00:01:35,293
Really?

30
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,261

LITTLE BULLY:  Hey, we were sitting there. LAUGH

39
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,883
CHANDLER: Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?

40
00:02:48,883 --> 00:02:51,300
LITTLE BULLY: Is that supposed to be funny?

41
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,887
CHANDLER: No actually, I was just going for colorful.

42
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:54,303
BIG BULLY: What's with this guy?

43
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:57,468
LITTLE BULLY: What's with you?

44
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,248
ROSS: Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.

45
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:14,259
CHANDLER: What just happened? LAUGH

46
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:18,862
LITTLE BULLY: I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took your hat.

47
00:03:18,862 --> 00:03:20,261
CHANDLER: That, that is funny. Can I have it back? LAUGH

00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:46,320
BIG BULLY: Why should we? LAUGH

55
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,259

56
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,830
Chandler--

57
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,263

CHANDLER: Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?

60
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:03,434
BIG BULLY: You got a problem with that?

61
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,296
Rach, I've gone dad-hunting

62
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,247
with Phoebe before.

63
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,463
This is a very scary thing for her.

64
00:04:11,463 --> 00:04:16,302
She gets real vulnerable and that's why we're there,

65
00:04:16,302 --> 00:04:18,350
to be supportive and crap.

66
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,738
Okay. You just let me know

67
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:22,251

00:19:27,897 --> 00:19:29,296
FRANK: Alright.

319
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,392
PHOEBE: Ok, I'm in the book.

00:19:53,371 --> 00:19:58,429

00:20:15,742 --> 00:20:17,238
CHANDLER: You burn your mouth?

330
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,253

00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:26,447

LITTLE BULLY: Oh, look who's here, it's the weenies.

333
00:20:30,441 --> 00:20:32,489
BIG BULLY: Did we not make ourselves clear the other day.

334
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,460
ROSS: Yes, and that's why we're here.

335
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,385
CHANDLER: Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently.

336
00:20:39,385 --> 00:20:40,500
LITTLE BULLY: Let's do this alright.

337
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,500
ROSS: Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon?

338
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,370
LITTLE BULLY: It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs.

339
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:52,477
LITTLE BULLY: Alright.

340
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,932
CHANDLER: Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?

341
00:20:53,932 --> 00:20:58,288
ROSS: Whad'ya mean?

342
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,423
CHANDLER: Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it.

343
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,339
Or your keys.

344
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:04,351
BIG BULLY: No, you can't use your watch.

345
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:10,233
CHANDLER: Ok.

346
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,398

352
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:25,341
BIG BULLY: Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces?

353
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,477
ROSS: Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation.

354
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,802
This no-faces thing

355
00:21:31,802 --> 00:21:33,349
might not be a bad idea.

356
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:39,387
LITTLE BULLY: Actually, you know, uh, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea.

00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,880
Dana's ovulating.

00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,461

00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:29,243
BIG BULLY: Don't do that to yourself. Any one of us could have tripped over that little girls jump-rope.

373
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,864
