1
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:05,832
Phoebe:  Hi guys!

2
00:00:05,832 --> 00:00:06,395
All: Hey, Pheebs! Hi!

3
00:00:07,204 --> 00:00:08,233
Ross: Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?

4
00:00:08,233 --> 00:00:12,399
Phoebe: Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'

5
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:16,379
Rachel: What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right? LAUGH

6
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:22,209
Monica: Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'. LAUGH

7
00:00:23,287 --> 00:00:24,379
Rachel: Since when?

8
00:00:25,222 --> 00:00:31,386
Joey: Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.

9
00:00:33,197 --> 00:00:39,225
Chandler: Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.

10
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:44,305
Phoebe: Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.

11
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,302
Rachel: And everybody knows this?

12
00:00:48,312 --> 00:00:49,336
Joey: Yeah. Cushions the blow.

13
00:00:49,413 --> 00:00:54,342
Chandler: Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.

14
00:00:54,418 --> 00:01:01,382
Ross: That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.

15
00:01:02,193 --> 00:01:03,353
Monica: Uh, Ross.

16
00:01:05,196 --> 00:01:20,200
Ross: What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!

17
00:02:13,264 --> 00:02:16,198
Chandler: "So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"

18
00:02:16,267 --> 00:02:24,369
Joey: "Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."

19
00:02:26,177 --> 00:02:28,202
Chandler: Hey, that was really good! LAUGH

20
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:30,179
Joey: Thanks! Let's keep going.

21
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:34,217
Chandler: Okay. "So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"

22
00:02:36,387 --> 00:02:40,379
Joey: "I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke." LAUGH

23
00:02:41,192 --> 00:02:43,183
Chandler: "Smoke away."

24
00:02:55,506 --> 00:02:59,306
Chandler: I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.

25
00:03:00,244 --> 00:03:01,256
Joey: What? LAUGH

26
00:03:01,256 --> 00:03:04,280
Chandler: Relax your hand!

27
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:06,248
Chandler: Not so much! LAUGH

28
00:03:07,351 --> 00:03:10,149
Chandler: Alright, now try taking a puff.

29
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:15,721
Chandler: Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.

30
00:03:15,721 --> 00:03:17,251
Joey: No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.

31
00:03:17,294 --> 00:03:21,252
Chandler: It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.

32
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:33,265
Chandler: Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete. LAUGH

33
00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:35,275
Joey: Y'miss it?

34
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:47,307
Chandler: Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. LAUGH

35
00:03:47,307 --> 00:03:48,291
No. You've got options.

36
00:03:48,392 --> 00:03:50,223
You can smoke like this:

37
00:03:50,294 --> 00:03:51,340
Chandler--

38
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,386
Or hold it in your mouth.

39
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:54,226
Give me the cigarette!

40
00:03:54,331 --> 00:03:54,911
You try.

41
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:55,491
Thank you.

42
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:58,292
Okay, how's this?

43
00:04:01,138 --> 00:04:03,163
Okay, that's not bad.

44
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,253
All right, when you're finished,

45
00:04:05,253 --> 00:04:07,266
it's cool if you flick it.

46
00:04:09,246 --> 00:04:15,250
All right, you keep practicing and I'll go put out the sofa. LAUGH

47
00:04:19,256 --> 00:04:28,297
Monica: No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.

48
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,361
Joey: That's ridiculous! LAUGH

49
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:39,267
Ross: Can I use.. either thumb? LAUGH

50
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:42,270
I'd rather go with the foot theory.

51
00:04:42,379 --> 00:05:00,697
Rachel:  Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!

52
00:05:00,697 --> 00:05:02,164
All: Yeah. Yeah, excellent.

53
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:03,325
Rachel:  Good for me!

54
00:05:17,348 --> 00:05:18,764
Joey: Y'okay, Phoebe? LAUGH

55
00:05:18,764 --> 00:05:21,444
Phoebe: Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.

56
00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:23,215
Monica: What did they do to you?

57
00:05:23,215 --> 00:05:28,189
Phoebe: It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-

58
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:30,192
Ross: Easy.

59
00:05:31,462 --> 00:05:34,363
Phoebe: \- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.

60
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:38,292
Chandler: Oh, Satan's minions at work again...

61
00:05:38,402 --> 00:05:41,269
Phoebe: Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.

62
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:43,284
Joey: What are you talking about? Keep it!

63
00:05:43,284 --> 00:05:47,310
Phoebe: It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.

64
00:05:47,378 --> 00:05:51,212
Rachel: Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!

65
00:05:53,284 --> 00:06:07,263
Phoebe: Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'... LAUGH

66
00:06:07,331 --> 00:06:09,231
Monica: We're with you. We got it.

67
00:06:10,334 --> 00:06:14,326
Phoebe: Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.

68
00:06:14,371 --> 00:06:16,362
Rachel: Chandler, what are you doing?

69
00:06:17,274 --> 00:06:19,265
Monica:  Hey. Whaddya doing?

70
00:06:21,378 --> 00:06:24,279
All: Oh! Oh, God! LAUGH

71
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:25,814
Ross: What is this?!

72
00:06:25,814 --> 00:06:27,247
Chandler: I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.

73
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:30,149
Phoebe: Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!

74
00:06:30,254 --> 00:06:33,246
Chandler: And this- is my reward! LAUGH

75
00:06:34,258 --> 00:06:41,195
Ross: Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.

76
00:06:41,265 --> 00:06:43,358
Chandler: Okay, so this time I won't quit! LAUGH

77
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,833
All: Ohhh! Put it out!

78
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,266
Chandler: All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. 

79
00:06:47,371 --> 00:06:51,299
Phoebe: Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!

80
00:06:55,312 --> 00:06:57,303
Monica: Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.

81
00:06:57,414 --> 00:07:00,144
Rachel: This Alan again? How's it goin'?

82
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,242
Monica: 'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.

83
00:07:04,355 --> 00:07:06,323
Joey: So when do we get to meet the guy?

84
00:07:06,357 --> 00:07:09,340
Monica: Let's see, today's Monday... Never.

85
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,255
All: Oh, come on! Come on! LAUGH

86
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:12,352
Monica: No. Not after what happened with Steve.

87
00:07:13,163 --> 00:07:21,326
Chandler: What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.

88
00:07:21,438 --> 00:07:24,430
Monica: Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.

89
00:07:25,175 --> 00:07:27,143
Rachel: Well, then can we meet him?

90
00:07:27,177 --> 00:07:30,145
Monica: Nope. Schhorry. LAUGH

91
00:07:32,282 --> 00:07:35,342
Joey. Let it go.

92
00:07:39,256 --> 00:07:47,355
Monica: I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd. LAUGH

93
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:59,300
Paula: Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you.

94
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:03,106
Monica: I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.

95
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:10,313
Paula: Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy.. LAUGH

96
00:08:10,354 --> 00:08:12,254
Can't I whimper a little bit?

97
00:08:12,254 --> 00:08:14,154
Whimper.

98
00:08:16,126 --> 00:08:17,423
Okay, I'm done. LAUGH

99
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:20,253
Joey: Let it go, Ross.

100
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:23,131
Ross: Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.

101
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:28,303
Monica: Do you all promise?

102
00:08:28,303 --> 00:08:31,163
All: Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!

103
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:34,335
Monica:  Chandler? Do you promise to be good?

104
00:08:42,152 --> 00:08:46,248
Joey: You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside! LAUGH

105
00:08:55,432 --> 00:09:15,209
Phoebe: 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this-  -_football phone_ as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone! LAUGH

106
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,112
Rachel: What bank is this? LAUGH

107
00:09:20,224 --> 00:09:24,639
Monica: Hey. It's him.  Who is it? LAUGH

108
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,151
Alan:  It's Alan.

109
00:09:25,229 --> 00:09:27,129
Joey:  Chandler! He's here!

110
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:31,156
Do I look okay?

111
00:09:32,135 --> 00:09:33,227
One more button.

112
00:09:33,337 --> 00:09:35,271
Closed! How about closed?

113
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,307
I didn't know.

114
00:09:37,307 --> 00:09:38,274
Yeah.

115
00:09:39,443 --> 00:09:44,347
Monica:  Okay, please be good, _please_. Just remember how much you all like me.

116
00:09:46,183 --> 00:09:50,347
Monica: Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.

117
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:57,385
Alan: I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!

118
00:10:04,368 --> 00:10:17,211
Monica:  Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?

119
00:10:18,282 --> 00:10:19,306
Monica: C'mon!

120
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:30,284
Ross: ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.

121
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:32,328
All: Loved him! Yeah! He's great! LAUGH

122
00:10:32,396 --> 00:10:36,298
Monica: Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that _I'm_ going out with?

123
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,197
That pimento trick!

124
00:10:38,302 --> 00:10:39,815
I'll never look at an olive

125
00:10:39,815 --> 00:10:41,328
the same way again.

126
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:43,303
Rachel: And did you notice...? LAUGH

127
00:10:48,345 --> 00:10:51,313
Joey: Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.

128
00:10:51,415 --> 00:10:53,411
Phoebe: Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!

129
00:10:53,411 --> 00:10:55,407
Ross: ...What shoe?

130
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:04,191
Phoebe: From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...' LAUGH

131
00:11:06,363 --> 00:11:13,259
Ross: ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.

132
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,719
Rachel: What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.

133
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:18,266
Monica: Really!

134
00:11:18,308 --> 00:11:25,280
Chandler: Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? 

135
00:11:29,186 --> 00:11:30,249
Ross: You know what I like most about him, though? LAUGH

136
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:31,312
All: What?

137
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:35,383
Ross: The way he makes me feel about myself.

138
00:11:57,447 --> 00:11:59,438
Monica: Hi.. how was the game?

139
00:12:00,183 --> 00:12:01,275
Ross: Well..

140
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:04,252
All: WE WON!! Thank you! Yes! LAUGH

141
00:12:05,188 --> 00:12:08,156
Monica: Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?

142
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,205
Joey: Alan.

143
00:12:10,205 --> 00:12:19,361
Ross: He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...

144
00:12:23,173 --> 00:12:25,403
Rachel: I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.

145
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:31,170
Chandler: Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.. LAUGH

146
00:12:32,215 --> 00:12:36,310
Monica: Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..

147
00:12:36,386 --> 00:12:37,375
Ross: What?

148
00:12:37,487 --> 00:12:40,320
Monica: ..I dunno, a little too Alan?

149
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:44,292
Rachel: Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.

150
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:49,287
Ross: Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.

151
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:52,324
Chandler: I personally could have a gallon of Alan.

152
00:13:00,177 --> 00:13:01,223
Phoebe: Hey, Lizzie. LAUGH

153
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:02,269
Lizzie: Hey, Weird Girl.

154
00:13:03,246 --> 00:13:04,292
Phoebe: I brought you alphabet soup.

155
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:05,338
Lizzie: Did you pick out the vowels?

156
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:11,299
Phoebe: Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, "sometimes y". Uh, I also have something else for you. 

157
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:12,345
Lizzie: Saltines?

158
00:13:12,456 --> 00:13:15,186
Phoebe: No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?

159
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:21,294
Lizzie: What?  Oh my God, there's really money in here.

160
00:13:21,294 --> 00:13:22,391
Phoebe: I know.

161
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,360
Lizzie: Weird Girl, what are you doing?

162
00:13:25,168 --> 00:13:28,296
Phoebe: No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.

163
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:29,901
Lizzie: No, no, I ha-I have to give you something.

164
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:31,397
Phoebe: Oh, that's fine, no.

165
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:33,790
Lizzie: Would you like my tin-foil hat?

166
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,929
Phoebe: No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.

167
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:38,379
Lizzie: Please, let me do something.

168
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:44,209
Phoebe: Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?

169
00:13:45,222 --> 00:13:45,819
Lizzie: Okay.

170
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:46,416
Phoebe: Okay.

171
00:14:48,285 --> 00:14:52,412
Lizzie: Keep the change.  Sure you don't wanna pretzel? LAUGH

172
00:14:53,223 --> 00:14:54,707
Phoebe: No, I'm fine.

173
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:56,191
Lizzie:  See ya.

174
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:06,226
Ross: A _thumb_?!

175
00:15:07,337 --> 00:15:14,240
Phoebe: I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!

176
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:19,237
Chandler: Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?

177
00:15:20,283 --> 00:15:21,767
Phoebe: Does, um, anyone wanna see?

178
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:23,251
All: Nooo!

179
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:26,381
All: Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!

180
00:15:27,157 --> 00:15:29,352
Rachel: It's worse than the thumb!

181
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:32,258
Chandler: Hey, this is so unfair!

182
00:15:32,258 --> 00:15:33,355
Monica: Oh, why is it unfair?

183
00:15:34,164 --> 00:15:53,211
Chandler: So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?

184
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:03,247
Joey: ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?

185
00:16:06,229 --> 00:16:08,163
Rachel: Well, I-I could live without it.

186
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:16,162
Joey: Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?

187
00:16:18,341 --> 00:16:21,333
Ross: Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.

188
00:16:22,145 --> 00:16:24,170
Joey: Oh,  "you do, do you"?

189
00:16:30,253 --> 00:16:33,279
Ross: You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.

190
00:16:33,456 --> 00:16:36,289
Rachel: "Indeed there isn't"... I should really get back to work.

191
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:44,265
Phoebe: Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.

192
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:50,295
Rachel: Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.

193
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:08,312
Monica: Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?

194
00:17:08,358 --> 00:17:10,258
Paula: No.

195
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:16,159
Monica: Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.

196
00:17:16,232 --> 00:17:23,238
Paula: Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!

197
00:17:24,174 --> 00:17:33,147
Monica: Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel _the thing_. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.

198
00:17:33,249 --> 00:17:44,190
Paula: Honey.. you should always feel _the thing_. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!

199
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,824
Monica: I know.. it's gonna be really hard.

200
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:47,388
Paula: Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it.

201
00:17:48,164 --> 00:17:53,158
Monica: No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.

202
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:55,265
Joey: Do you have any respect for your body?

203
00:17:55,265 --> 00:17:57,261
Ross: Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?

204
00:17:57,374 --> 00:18:06,104
Chandler: Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.

205
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:11,253
Rachel:  Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.

206
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:42,149
Chandler: Really? He does? 

207
00:18:51,394 --> 00:18:54,158
Rachel:  God, he's good.

208
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:56,315
Ross: If only he were a woman.

209
00:18:56,315 --> 00:18:58,266
Rachel: Yeah.

210
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:12,304
Chandler: Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.

211
00:19:14,317 --> 00:19:19,151
Ross: Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. 

212
00:19:22,358 --> 00:19:23,842
Monica:  Hey. Where's Joey?

213
00:19:23,842 --> 00:19:30,256
Chandler: Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?

214
00:19:32,135 --> 00:19:33,232
Rachel: I think he's across the hall.

215
00:19:33,232 --> 00:19:34,329
Monica: Thanks. 

216
00:19:35,238 --> 00:19:37,229
Ross:  There y'go.

217
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,332
Chandler:  Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.

218
00:19:40,376 --> 00:19:44,278
Ross: Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?

219
00:19:45,381 --> 00:19:48,349
Phoebe: Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?

220
00:19:50,186 --> 00:19:52,154
Ross: Hey, I might!

221
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:59,157
Phoebe: Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.

222
00:20:00,296 --> 00:20:06,292
Phoebe: And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!

223
00:20:06,402 --> 00:20:08,398
Joey:  What's going on?

224
00:20:08,398 --> 00:20:10,394
Monica: Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.

225
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:14,301
Joey: Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..

226
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,184
Monica: Please, guys, we have to talk.

227
00:20:27,223 --> 00:20:31,284
Phoebe: Wait, wait, I'm getting a _deja vu_...no, I'm not.

228
00:20:34,197 --> 00:20:35,693
Monica: Alright, we have to talk.

229
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,189
Phoebe: There it is!

230
00:20:39,402 --> 00:20:59,412
Monica: Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.

231
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:06,160
Ross: Is there somebody else?

232
00:21:07,463 --> 00:21:12,464
Monica: No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.

233
00:21:13,203 --> 00:21:15,296
Rachel: We didn't change..

234
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:23,268
Joey: So that's it? It's over? Just like that?

235
00:21:24,314 --> 00:21:29,376
Phoebe: You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I- 

236
00:21:32,422 --> 00:21:33,804
Monica: Look, I- I could go on pretending-

237
00:21:33,804 --> 00:21:35,186
Joey: Okay!

238
00:21:35,225 --> 00:21:39,386
Monica: -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!

239
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:46,224
Ross: Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.

240
00:21:48,238 --> 00:21:50,268
Monica: I'm sorry..

241
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:52,298
Chandler:  Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!

242
00:21:53,409 --> 00:22:00,247
Rachel:  I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-

243
00:22:01,251 --> 00:22:04,185
Monica: I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.

244
00:22:04,254 --> 00:22:05,278
All: Oh, yeah! Right!

245
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,211
Monica: Are you guys gonna be okay?

246
00:22:12,211 --> 00:22:16,358
Ross: Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.

247
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:19,392
Monica:  I understand.

248
00:22:24,374 --> 00:22:25,773
Alan: Wow.

249
00:22:25,773 --> 00:22:27,172
Monica: I'm, I'm really sorry.

250
00:22:27,277 --> 00:22:31,893
Alan: Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved.

251
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,406
Monica: Relieved?

252
00:22:34,217 --> 00:22:41,223
Alan: Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends.

253
00:22:47,196 --> 00:22:54,394
Rachel: Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.

254
00:22:55,405 --> 00:22:58,397
Ross: Yeah. He could row like a viking.

255
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,243
Ross: So how'd it go?

256
00:23:09,452 --> 00:23:11,352
Monica: Oh, y'know..

257
00:23:11,387 --> 00:23:14,185
Phoebe: Did he mention us?

258
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:21,253
Monica: He said he's really gonna miss you guys. 

259
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:32,264
Ross: You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. 

260
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:36,341
Chandler: ...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.

261
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:37,404
All: No no no!

262
00:23:38,181 --> 00:23:42,284
Chandler:  I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!

263
00:23:42,385 --> 00:23:46,287
Phoebe:  If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!

264
00:23:46,322 --> 00:23:48,290
Chandler:  Yeah, alright. LAUGH
