1
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,430
Rachel: Ross kissed me.

2
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:09,271
Monica: Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

3
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,793
Rachel: It was unbelievable!

4
00:00:11,793 --> 00:00:14,244
Monica: Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god! LAUGH

5
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:22,285
Phoebe: Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?

6
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,448
Rachel: Oh, it ended very well.

7
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:29,292
Monica:  Do not start without me. Do not start without me.

8
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:38,269
Phoebe: Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a "I gotta have you now" kind of thing? LAUGH

9
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:46,309
Rachel: Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it.

10
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,281
Phoebe: Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?

11
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:57,517
Rachel: No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair. LAUGH

12
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,443
Ross: And, uh, and then I kissed her. LAUGH

13
00:01:01,443 --> 00:01:03,360
Joey: Tongue?

14
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,442
Ross: Yeah.

15
00:01:04,442 --> 00:01:05,454
Joey: Cool.

16
00:01:52,378 --> 00:02:04,254
Chandler: All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.

17
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,450
Phoebe: Wow. What are you gonna use it for?

18
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,455
Chandler:  Games and stuff.

19
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,364
Monica:  There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me. LAUGH

20
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:18,284
Joey:  Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?

21
00:02:18,284 --> 00:02:20,332
Monica: There's an ad for a naked chef? LAUGH

22
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:27,436
Joey: No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then... LAUGH

23
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,352
Phoebe: Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night? LAUGH

24
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:43,354
Ross: That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful LAUGH

25
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:46,456
Monica: Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.

26
00:02:46,499 --> 00:03:03,246
Ross: Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?

27
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,443
Joey: You got all that from saline solution? LAUGH

28
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,852
I'm the same way. Show me a bottle

29
00:03:09,852 --> 00:03:12,451
of Visine and I'm like, ''Who am I?'' LAUGH

30
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:17,226
Monica: We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.

31
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:30,332
Ross: Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... ... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.

32
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:31,438
Rachel:  Hey, you.

33
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:32,433
Ross: How are you?

34
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,041
Rachel: Good. How are you?

35
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,537
Ross: Good.

36
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,328
Julie: Hi, honey.

37
00:03:37,328 --> 00:03:43,285
Ross: Hi, Julie.  Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you? LAUGH

38
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:43,919
Julie: Good.

39
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:57,265
Ross:  Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe? LAUGH

40
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,382
Phoebe: Oh, well, actually.

41
00:03:58,382 --> 00:03:59,394
Ross:  Play it.

42
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,399
Phoebe: Ok, all right.

43
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,824
Joey: Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.

44
00:04:04,824 --> 00:04:06,405
Julie: What? LAUGH

45
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:27,321
Phoebe: Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, "Two of Them Kissed Last Night". LAUGH

46
00:04:29,435 --> 00:05:08,236
Phoebe:  There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide! LAUGH

47
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:18,408
Mr. Ratstatter: This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. _Muy impressivo._

48
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,253
Shame none of it's true. LAUGH

49
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,314
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

50
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,938
No, it's all true. Just a little

51
00:05:26,938 --> 00:05:29,452
nervous, that's all. I'm fine now.

52
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:35,257
Monica: So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.

53
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,785
Mr. Ratstatter: Mockolate.

54
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:38,235
Monica: I'm sorry? LAUGH

55
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:42,331
Mr. Ratstatter: Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.

56
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:49,337
Mr. Ratstatter: Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate. LAUGH

57
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,350
Monica: All right. Mmm-mmm.

58
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:03,893
Monica:  I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that. LAUGH

59
00:06:03,893 --> 00:06:21,210
Mr. Ratstatter: No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you. LAUGH

60
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:27,307
Mr. Ratstatter: But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday. LAUGH

61
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,409
Monica: Wow.

62
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,448
Mr. Ratstatter: Aren't you going to swallow that?

63
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,419
Monica: Just waiting for it to stop bubbling. LAUGH

64
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,429
Mr. Ratstatter: Yeah, isn't that great?

65
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:45,261
Mr. Ratstatter: Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?

66
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:55,438
Monica: Abso......lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate. LAUGH

67
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,238
Mr. Ratstatter: Really?

68
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:02,380
Monica: Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas.

69
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,226
Monica: How about Mockolate mousse?

70
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,386
Phoebe: It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y.

71
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,393
Monica: Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?

72
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,427
Phoebe: What makes it pilgrim?

73
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,328
Monica: We'll put buckles on it. LAUGH

74
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,308
Rachel: Did uh, Ross call?

75
00:07:24,308 --> 00:07:26,208
Monica: No, I'm sorry.

76
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:39,452
Rachel: Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, "Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."

77
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:44,457
Phoebe: No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.

78
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:50,357
Ross: I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare. LAUGH

79
00:07:50,436 --> 00:08:02,379
Chandler: Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight. LAUGH

80
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,378
Joey: Hey, here's a thought, Ross. 

81
00:08:05,378 --> 00:08:07,374
Chandler: Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.

82
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:13,290
Joey: Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome. LAUGH

83
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,297
You still have another word,

84
00:08:20,297 --> 00:08:22,197
if you wanna use it. LAUGH

85
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,848
Oh, hey. I think I know what it is.

86
00:08:23,848 --> 00:08:25,395
Help.

87
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:41,318
Chandler: Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column. LAUGH

88
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,305
Ross: Can't we just use a pen?

89
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:45,256
Chandler: No, Amish boy. LAUGH

90
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:51,428
Joey: Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first.

91
00:08:52,431 --> 00:09:00,268
Ross: I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.

92
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,397
Joey: You could say that.

93
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:19,381
Ross: And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress. LAUGH

94
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:31,497
Chandler: Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else? LAUGH

95
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,500
Ross: I don't know.

96
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,504
Joey: Oh, her ankles are a little chubby.

97
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,404
Chandler: Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her? LAUGH

98
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,412
Ross:  She's not Rachel.

99
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:59,355
Monica: Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served. LAUGH

100
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:03,867
Rachel: Oh my god. LAUGH

101
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:05,266
Monica: Oh my god good?

102
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:09,274
Rachel: Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth. LAUGH

103
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,438
Phoebe: Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!

104
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:34,493
Chandler: I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek? LAUGH

105
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,490
Joey:  Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?

106
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:53,382
Ross: Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing. LAUGH

107
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:57,422
Chandler:  So, Spock actually hugs his father? LAUGH

108
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,258
Rachel: Hey, do you guys have......hi.

109
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,224
Rachel:  Where you goin'?

110
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:11,334
Ross: I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's.

111
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:18,368
Ross: No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing.

112
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:29,283
Rachel: Well, what's the other thing, what do I think? LAUGH

113
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,382
Ross: Well, uh.

114
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:38,295
Joey: He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes. LAUGH

115
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,277
Rachel: Really?

116
00:11:40,277 --> 00:11:44,383
Ross: Really. It's always been you, Rach.

117
00:11:44,383 --> 00:11:46,465
Rachel: Oh, god.

118
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,417
Rachel: Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good. LAUGH

119
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:13,262
Ross: I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them? LAUGH

120
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:14,845
Rachel: Let me get my coat. LAUGH

121
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:19,268
Ross: Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat.

122
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:34,948
Rachel: Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable.  What's that? LAUGH

123
00:12:34,948 --> 00:12:36,444
Chandler:  What? Nothing.

124
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,837
Rachel: What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?

125
00:12:39,837 --> 00:12:41,384
Chandler: No, no, see? See?  Hey, it's printing!

126
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,451
Rachel: Well what is it? Let me see.

127
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:46,292
Hey, it's printing! LAUGH

128
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,413
Rachel: Well what is it? Let me see.

129
00:12:48,413 --> 00:12:50,261
Ross: Hey, someone order a coat?

130
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:53,464
Rachel: Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see.

131
00:12:53,506 --> 00:13:02,310
Ross: He won't?  He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing? LAUGH

132
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:06,316
Chandler: Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing. LAUGH

133
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,343
Rachel: And I'm in it? Then let me read it.

134
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,251
Chandler, Joey, Ross: No!

135
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,340
Rachel: Come on. LAUGH

136
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,456
Joey: Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?

137
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,335
All right. LAUGH

138
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:59,403
Chandler:  "It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."

139
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:06,234
Ross: That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.

140
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:12,306
Rachel: All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it.

141
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,318
Ross: No, you don't.

142
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:22,351
Rachel: All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it. 

143
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:29,930
Rachel: What is this? Ross, what is this?

144
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,426
That is....

145
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:33,427
Rachel: What is this? Ross, what is this?

146
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:34,905
Thank you.

147
00:14:34,905 --> 00:14:36,338
Chandler: Good luck.

148
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:42,345
Ross: Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?

149
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:48,341
Rachel: Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?

150
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:52,446
Ross: Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type "little", the idiot.

151
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,393
Rachel: Just a waitress?

152
00:14:56,495 --> 00:15:05,199
Ross: No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?

153
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:09,237
Rachel: Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!

154
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:14,401
Ross: No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.

155
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:24,220
Rachel: She is not _Rachem_. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.

156
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:36,233
Ross: No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?

157
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:45,431
Chandler: My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary.

158
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:51,273
Monica: You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.

159
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:57,354
Phoebe: I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.

160
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,282
Joey: Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.

161
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,224
Phoebe: What?

162
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,389
Chandler: Oh good, I was hoping that would come up.

163
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,297
Monica: This was your idea?

164
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:12,498
Chandler:  All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason.

165
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,229
Monica: Yeah. You!

166
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:20,337
Chandler: All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?

167
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:25,342
Phoebe: Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.

168
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:48,431
Ross: Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!

169
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:55,337
Rachel:  When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape.

170
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,416
Ross: I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.

171
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,385
Rachel: Not interested.

172
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:20,395
Ross:  Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben.

173
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,300
Ross: Number six: the way you smell.

174
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,327
Joey:  Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?

175
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:29,210
Ross: Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?

176
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,441
Joey: Oh, yeah, I do.

177
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,214
Chandler: What are you doing out there?

178
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:40,418
Monica: Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?

179
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:50,224
Ross: Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance.

180
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,237
Rachel: No.

181
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,299
Ross: No?

182
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:54,294
Rachel: That's what I said.

183
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,954
Chandler: Look, maybe we should go?

184
00:17:55,954 --> 00:17:57,535
Rachel: No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking.

185
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,824
Ross: Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel.

186
00:17:59,824 --> 00:18:16,383
Rachel:  No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.

187
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:21,296
Ross: No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things.

188
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:26,432
Rachel: Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross.  I said don't go!

189
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:39,307
Ross: You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you.

190
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:45,450
Rachel: Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list.

191
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,838
I never know how long to wait in this

192
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:06,403
type of situation before you can talk.

193
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,272
Joey:  Maybe a little longer.

194
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:27,490
Monica: Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate.

195
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,263
Mr. Ratstatter: Doesn't matter.

196
00:19:30,263 --> 00:19:31,292
Monica: What?

197
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:37,307
Mr. Ratstatter: Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.

198
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,778
Monica: Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

199
00:19:40,778 --> 00:19:51,311
Mr. Ratstatter: Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check.  Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?

200
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,221
Monica: Well, uh, I ate some.

201
00:19:53,325 --> 00:20:01,321
Mr. Ratstatter: Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?

202
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:24,353
Rachel:  Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down.

203
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,357
Monica:  Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time.

204
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,362
Ross: Look, can, can you do something for me?

205
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:43,373
Monica: Sure, what? Ok, ok.  Music?

206
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,273
Sure.

207
00:20:51,383 --> 00:21:02,221
Radio: The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him. 

208
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:57,473
Radio: Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out.

209
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,374
Mr. Ratstatter: Hi, thanks for coming in again.

210
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,352
Monica: Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash.

211
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:55,790
Mr. Ratstatter: It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called "fishtachios". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?

212
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,274
Monica: Cat hair.

213
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,468
Mr. Ratstatter: Oh, sorry. LAUGH
