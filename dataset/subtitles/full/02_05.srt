00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,438
ROSS: Man, I sure miss Julie.

2
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:18,310
CHANDLER: Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there. LAUGH

3
00:00:24,227 --> 00:00:26,525
ROSS: You ever figure out what that thing's for? LAUGH

4
00:00:27,263 --> 00:00:31,244
CHANDLER: No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.

5
00:00:31,244 --> 00:00:33,223
people will think I have no life.

6
00:00:33,336 --> 00:00:34,331
My God! LAUGH

7
00:00:34,331 --> 00:00:35,326
Rodrigo is never pinned!

8
00:00:35,438 --> 00:00:36,854
After the beep,

9
00:00:36,854 --> 00:00:38,270
you know what to do.

10
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:43,345
: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,877
I was thinking about how great it was.

12
00:00:45,877 --> 00:00:50,464
I know it's been three years but I was hoping LAUGH

13
00:00:50,464 --> 00:00:52,477
we could hook up again.

14
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:54,284
I barely had the nerve

15
00:00:54,284 --> 00:00:55,279
to call... LAUGH

16
00:00:55,392 --> 00:00:56,421
-...so you know what I did?.

17
00:00:56,421 --> 00:00:57,450
JADE: Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?

18
00:00:57,494 --> 00:01:01,197
CHANDLER: What? LAUGH

19
00:01:01,297 --> 00:01:03,231
JADE: I got a little drunk...and naked.

20
00:01:52,382 --> 00:01:55,374
CHANDLER: Bob here. LAUGH

21
00:01:55,452 --> 00:02:02,286
CHANDLER:  What've you been up to?

22
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:06,324
And in case you wondered those are my legs on

23
00:02:06,324 --> 00:02:08,354
the new James Bond poster.

24
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:14,784
JADE: Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.

25
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:15,364
CHANDLER: Can you hold on a moment? I have another call.  I love her.

26
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:18,322
ROSS: I know.

27
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:19,437
CHANDLER: I'm back.

28
00:02:20,243 --> 00:02:24,879
JADE: So, are we gonna get together or what?

29
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,312
5-ish?

30
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:28,783
CHANDLER: Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?

31
00:02:28,783 --> 00:02:36,419
JADE: Great, I'll see you then.

32
00:02:37,427 --> 00:02:43,795
CHANDLER: Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.

33
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:45,325
hey, you're not Bob.

34
00:02:45,435 --> 00:02:48,268
You see Tattoo.... LAUGH

35
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:50,422
Jade's fantasy is to rekindle

36
00:02:50,422 --> 00:02:52,373
the love she had with Bob.

37
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:54,471
My fantasy is that you

38
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:56,467
talk like a normal person.

39
00:02:57,247 --> 00:03:01,729
ROSS: Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, "hey, you're not Bob." LAUGH

40
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:04,209
of the wry stranger at the next table.

41
00:03:04,287 --> 00:03:07,381
CHANDLER: I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table. LAUGH

42
00:03:08,324 --> 00:03:17,322
ROSS: Oh my god. You are pure evil.

43
00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:28,402
CHANDLER: Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this. LAUGH

44
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:29,433
ROSS:  Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.

45
00:03:30,246 --> 00:03:33,306
ALL: Hi, Julie!

46
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:38,352
RACHEL:  Hi, Julie. LAUGH

47
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:47,253
CHANDLER: Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday. LAUGH

48
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,422
PHOEBE: Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20? LAUGH

49
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:53,264
CHANDLER: Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.

50
00:03:54,337 --> 00:03:57,272
JOEY: Do we need a cake?

51
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:01,267
RACHEL: Yeah, whoosh!

52
00:04:02,212 --> 00:04:02,706
CHANDLER: But it's Ross. LAUGH

53
00:04:02,706 --> 00:04:03,200
PHOEBE: It's Ross.

54
00:04:03,313 --> 00:04:03,842
I know.

55
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:04,371
All right.

56
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,416
JOEY: All right. LAUGH

57
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:11,319
CHANDLER: I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.

58
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:12,905
You're not going through with this,

59
00:04:12,905 --> 00:04:14,389
are you?

60
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:17,421
You know, I think I might just. LAUGH

61
00:04:19,429 --> 00:04:23,331
CHANDLER: You know, I think I might just. LAUGH

62
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:27,335
RACHEL: So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?

63
00:04:27,403 --> 00:04:28,899
I guess I'll stay home

64
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:30,395
and eat dust bunnies.

65
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:33,300
JOEY: Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.

66
00:04:33,343 --> 00:04:39,312
PHOEBE: Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?

67
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,411
that we don't make that much money?

68
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:42,730
RACHEL: Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do? LAUGH

69
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,242
Really?

70
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:46,253
RACHEL: Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?

71
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:47,835
Like we can afford to go

72
00:04:47,835 --> 00:04:49,348
here and there.

73
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:55,261
JOEY: Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying "let's go here, let's go there". Like we can afford to go here and there.

74
00:04:55,365 --> 00:04:57,833
And we can't say anything about it,

75
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,301
because this is a birthday for Ross.

76
00:05:00,403 --> 00:05:01,335
PHOEBE: Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.

77
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:02,267
JOEY: For Ross. LAUGH

78
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:06,237
RACHEL: For Ross, Ross, Ross.

79
00:05:06,237 --> 00:05:07,300
MONICA:  Oh my god.

80
00:05:07,377 --> 00:05:13,315
RACHEL: What? LAUGH

81
00:05:14,183 --> 00:05:16,413
The manager calls me into his office.

82
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:18,682
They fired the lunch chef.

83
00:05:18,682 --> 00:05:20,178
Guess who got it?

84
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,282
MONICA: I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job. LAUGH

85
00:05:24,394 --> 00:05:29,229
JOEY: If it's not you, this is a horrible story.

86
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:31,199
That's so cool!

87
00:05:31,234 --> 00:05:32,764
Anyway, I think we

88
00:05:32,764 --> 00:05:34,294
should go out and celebrate. LAUGH

89
00:05:34,404 --> 00:05:37,202
MONICA: Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.

90
00:05:42,312 --> 00:05:43,438
Someplace nice. LAUGH

91
00:05:44,247 --> 00:05:45,731
How much you think

92
00:05:45,731 --> 00:05:47,215
I can get for my kidney?

93
00:05:53,256 --> 00:05:54,353
JOEY: Yeah, someplace nice. LAUGH

94
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:57,772
ROSS: I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.

95
00:05:57,772 --> 00:05:59,319
conventional methods.

96
00:05:59,362 --> 00:06:02,262
CHANDLER: Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.

97
00:06:02,365 --> 00:06:03,832
Bob could be

98
00:06:03,832 --> 00:06:05,299
who she was meant to be with.

99
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:06,881
You may be destroying

100
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:08,394
a chance for happiness. LAUGH

101
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:11,265
We don't know Bob.

102
00:06:11,374 --> 00:06:13,342
Okay, we know me. We like me.

103
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:15,310
Please let me be happy.

104
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:20,181
CHANDLER: We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy. LAUGH

105
00:06:20,316 --> 00:06:22,307
ROSS: Go over there and tell that woman the truth.

106
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:24,379
CHANDLER: All right. LAUGH

107
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:32,857
ROSS: Go.

108
00:06:32,857 --> 00:06:34,387
CHANDLER: Hi.

JADE: Hi. LAUGH

110
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:41,300
CHANDLER: Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.

111
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:46,299
JADE: Yes?

112
00:06:47,243 --> 00:06:48,238
CHANDLER: Whoever stood you up is a jerk. LAUGH

113
00:06:48,238 --> 00:06:53,365
JADE: How did you--?

114
00:06:53,365 --> 00:06:56,317
that's me, I'm weird and sensitive.

115
00:06:58,254 --> 00:06:59,346
Tissue?

116
00:07:00,256 --> 00:07:01,382
CHANDLER: I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?

117
00:07:02,392 --> 00:07:08,195
JADE: Thanks. LAUGH

118
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:26,269
CHANDLER: No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today. LAUGH

119
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:28,306
ROSS: Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--

120
00:07:28,384 --> 00:07:31,318
MONICA: Who is also in charge of purchasing. LAUGH

121
00:07:31,421 --> 00:07:35,289
ROSS: Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--

122
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:41,312
MONICA: Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.

123
00:07:41,312 --> 00:07:43,195
ROSS: Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--

124
00:07:43,232 --> 00:07:44,329
MONICA: Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!

125
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:45,426
JOEY: Cool.

126
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:48,326
PHOEBE: Let's see!

127
00:07:48,404 --> 00:07:51,339
ROSS: That's fine, I'll just wait! LAUGH

128
00:07:51,407 --> 00:07:53,307
JOEY: Sorry, sorry.

129
00:07:55,411 --> 00:07:56,924
ROSS: Monica!

130
00:07:56,924 --> 00:07:58,437

00:07:59,215 --> 00:08:04,142
RACHEL: Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet. LAUGH

132
00:08:09,192 --> 00:08:10,352
WAITER: Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.

133
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,288
PHOEBE: Wow, look at these prices.

134
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:18,163
RACHEL: Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching. LAUGH

135
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:20,265
JOEY: What are these, like famous chickens?

136
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:21,362
Thanks.

137
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:23,439
I'm not sorry. How incredible

138
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,407
was my afternoon with Jade?

139
00:08:26,175 --> 00:08:30,167
CHANDLER: Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon.  I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?

140
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,292
Why is this woman leaving a message

141
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:34,305
for you on my machine?

142
00:08:34,383 --> 00:08:40,735
ROSS: Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?

143
00:08:40,735 --> 00:08:42,282
my number is Bob's number.

144
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:44,839
Tell me again.

145
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:46,386
CHANDLER: Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.

146
00:08:48,331 --> 00:08:49,320
ROSS: Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?

147
00:08:49,432 --> 00:08:53,232
WAITER: Do I dare ask?

148
00:08:53,336 --> 00:08:55,236
MONICA: Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.

149
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:56,868
ROSS: That sounds great. Same for me.

150
00:08:56,868 --> 00:09:01,290
WAITER: And for the gentleman?

151
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,372
and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?

152
00:09:04,247 --> 00:09:09,663
JOEY: Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?

153
00:09:09,663 --> 00:09:12,143
WAITER: You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?

154
00:09:12,388 --> 00:09:15,356
RACHEL: Ok, I will have the uh,  side salad. LAUGH

155
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:20,394
WAITER:  And what will that be on the side of?

00:09:22,398 --> 00:09:24,366
RACHEL: Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water? LAUGH

157
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:34,266
WAITER: And for you?

158
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:37,875
PHOEBE: Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care. LAUGH

159
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,371
CHANDLER: I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.

161
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,412

screaming your name.

276
00:17:18,207 --> 00:17:21,199

00:19:56,431 --> 00:19:59,229
Is that a hickey?

321
00:20:00,202 --> 00:20:04,296
PHOEBE: We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get-- is that a hickey? LAUGH

322
00:20:05,507 --> 00:20:10,758
MONICA: No, I just, I fell down.

323
00:20:10,758 --> 00:20:12,305
RACHEL: On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?

324
00:20:12,347 --> 00:20:14,281
MONICA: You know, a party, or--

325
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:24,358
RACHEL: What party?

326
00:20:24,426 --> 00:20:27,360
ROSS: It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.

327
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:31,365
JOEY: You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?

328
00:20:31,466 --> 00:20:34,230
CHANDLER: Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.

329
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:37,238
RACHEL: Who gave you that hickey?

330
00:20:39,441 --> 00:20:50,434
RACHEL: Oh!

331
00:20:50,434 --> 00:20:52,385
and having fun and all:

332
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:55,479
''Hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck!''

333
00:20:58,293 --> 00:21:01,193
PHOEBE: Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, "hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck".

334
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:05,326
ROSS: Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.

335
00:21:06,201 --> 00:21:07,293
RACHEL: What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?

336
00:21:07,336 --> 00:21:11,238
MONICA: It's work.

337
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,836
We're not gonna feel guilty.

338
00:21:12,836 --> 00:21:14,332
We work hard.

339
00:21:14,443 --> 00:21:16,308
CHANDLER: I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.

340
00:21:16,411 --> 00:21:18,311
JOEY: And we don't work hard?

341
00:21:18,347 --> 00:21:22,407
MONICA:  Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.

342
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:23,935
CHANDLER: I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.

343
00:21:23,935 --> 00:21:25,419
JOEY: And you feel like we hold you back.

344
00:21:26,221 --> 00:21:27,313
CHANDLER: Yes.

345
00:21:30,325 --> 00:21:38,228
CHANDLER: No. LAUGH

346
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:39,814
That was not a kickback.

347
00:21:39,814 --> 00:21:44,337
I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing.

348
00:21:46,275 --> 00:21:48,368
What corporate policy?

349
00:21:49,278 --> 00:21:50,336
No--

350
00:21:53,348 --> 00:21:54,372
Yeah.

351
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,342
Okay.

352
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,415
I just got fired.

353
00:22:09,231 --> 00:22:11,279
PHOEBE: Oh. LAUGH

354
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:19,303
WAITRESS: Here's your check. That'll be $4.12. LAUGH

355
00:22:27,516 --> 00:22:31,212
JOEY: Let me get that.  You got five bucks? LAUGH

356
00:22:31,253 --> 00:22:37,838
MACHINE: Here comes the beep, you know what to do. LAUGH

357
00:22:37,838 --> 00:22:39,351
I'm probably way out of line here. LAUGH

358
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:41,440
It's been three years,

359
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,483
and you're probably seeing someone but if we could have one night,

360
00:22:45,483 --> 00:22:47,434
for old times' sake....

361
00:22:47,469 --> 00:22:52,429
One hot, steamy, wild night.... LAUGH
