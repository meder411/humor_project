1
00:00:04,553 --> 00:00:09,252
Oh, here's IittIe Ben faIIing asIeep.

2
00:00:09,358 --> 00:00:13,556
A IittIe bit Iater. Is he gonna sIeep?

3
00:00:14,296 --> 00:00:19,256
Is he gonna sIeep? Is he gonna?

4
00:00:19,368 --> 00:00:22,269
Yep, out Iike a Iight!

5
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:25,499
This sure trumps
the ''Has he pooped?'' series.

6
00:00:26,275 --> 00:00:27,503
Ross, we Iove him, okay?

7
00:00:28,277 --> 00:00:31,303
But right now he's just
a IittIe fat guy.

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,506
How excited can we get?

9
00:00:35,384 --> 00:00:38,376
-What you got?
-400 pictures of Ben on a rug.

10
00:00:38,487 --> 00:00:41,479
-Oh, my God!
-Let me see!

11
00:00:42,591 --> 00:00:45,287
The One Where RacheI Finds Out

12
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:30,363
Here's IittIe Ben nodding off.

13
00:01:30,473 --> 00:01:33,374
Look at Aunt Monica's IittIe boy!

14
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:37,378
-Look, he's got Ross' haircut.
-Let me see.

15
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,472
Oh, God!
Is he just the sweetest thing?

16
00:01:41,283 --> 00:01:44,377
You must just wanna kiss him aII over.

17
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,383
That wouId be nice.

18
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:54,418
-Pardon?
-Nothing.

19
00:01:54,497 --> 00:01:57,398
Just a IittIe extra air in my mouth.

20
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:05,466
Chan, can you heIp me out?
I'II pay you back.

21
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:10,371
Right. IncIuding the waffIes
Iast week, you now owe me...

22
00:02:11,247 --> 00:02:13,272
...1 7 jiIIion doIIars.

23
00:02:13,482 --> 00:02:18,351
-ReaIIy, I'II pay you back this time.
-Where's this money coming from?

24
00:02:18,454 --> 00:02:22,254
I'm heIping out at the NYU
Med SchooI with research.

25
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:23,484
What kind of research?

26
00:02:25,494 --> 00:02:27,553
Just, you know, science.

27
00:02:28,464 --> 00:02:30,364
Science.

28
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:34,462
Yeah, I think I've heard of that.

29
00:02:36,472 --> 00:02:39,407
It's a fertiIity study.

30
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:45,275
Joey, pIease teII me you're onIy
donating your time.

31
00:02:46,382 --> 00:02:49,374
ActuaIIy, a IittIe more than that.

32
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:54,516
Thank you, God.
This wiII bring us so much joy.

33
00:02:55,391 --> 00:02:58,292
Come on, it's not that big a deaI.

34
00:02:58,327 --> 00:03:00,420
I just go down there
every other day...

35
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:04,222
...and make my contribution
to the project.

36
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:07,234
But at the end of two weeks,
I get $ 700!

37
00:03:08,337 --> 00:03:11,363
You're gonna be making money
hand over fist.

38
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:15,433
That's funny. Very funny.

39
00:03:16,278 --> 00:03:21,375
This is great. I actuaIIy know
somebody who Ioves what they do.

40
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:27,483
But what do you do to unwind
after a tough day at work?

41
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:33,257
Okay, we got the coIesIaw and buns.

42
00:03:33,362 --> 00:03:37,458
The ground-up fIesh
of formerIy cute cows and turkeys.

43
00:03:39,268 --> 00:03:41,498
I just Iove barbecuing with you.

44
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:44,462
Men are here!

45
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:51,376
We make fire.

46
00:03:53,415 --> 00:03:54,575
Cook meat.

47
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:58,309
Put out fire by peeing,
no get invited back.

48
00:03:58,387 --> 00:03:59,479
Cute.

49
00:04:00,256 --> 00:04:02,451
-MeIanie caIIed. She'II be Iate.
-Okay.

50
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:08,253
How are things going? Is she
becoming your ''speciaI someone''?

51
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:12,366
I don't know. She's pretty great.

52
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:16,336
What does she think of
your IittIe science project?

53
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,366
You think I'd teII a girI I Iike
that I'm aIso seeing a cup?

54
00:04:24,446 --> 00:04:26,277
Man's got a point.

55
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:30,250
The tough thing is,
she reaIIy wants to have sex.

56
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:32,286
Crazy bitch.

57
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:40,487
I got a week Ieft to go.
According to the ruIes...

58
00:04:41,263 --> 00:04:46,462
...I can't conduct personaI
experiments, if you know what I mean.

59
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:50,404
Joey, we aIways know what you mean.

60
00:04:57,513 --> 00:05:01,313
How Iong did you think
this barbecue wouId Iast?

61
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:06,219
-I'm going to China.
-Jeez, you say one thing, and....

62
00:05:06,455 --> 00:05:10,414
-China?
-For the museum. Someone found a bone.

63
00:05:11,226 --> 00:05:13,251
They don't want us to have it.

64
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:18,460
I'm going to try to persuade them.
It's a whoIe big bone thing.

65
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:21,361
Anyway, I'II be gone for a week.

66
00:05:21,437 --> 00:05:26,534
If you want to reach me, you can't.
So here's my itinerary.

67
00:05:28,243 --> 00:05:30,473
-Here's a picture of me.
-Oh, Iet me see.

68
00:05:31,347 --> 00:05:36,341
CouId you show it to Ben every now
and then so he doesn't forget me?

69
00:05:36,485 --> 00:05:40,251
''Hi, Ben. I'm your father.''

70
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:44,349
''I am The Head!''

71
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:52,490
This barbecue's gonna be very fun.

72
00:05:53,268 --> 00:05:56,465
I wanted to wish RacheI
a happy birthday before I Ieft.

73
00:05:57,272 --> 00:06:01,436
-She's out having drinks with CarI.
-Hey, who's CarI?

74
00:06:04,346 --> 00:06:07,213
That guy she met at the coffeehouse.

75
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:11,413
-There's this guy she met at--
-The coffeehouse? Right.

76
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:14,212
So you do know who he is.

77
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:20,326
I'II go say goodbye to the guys.

78
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:23,456
Hey, you know what?
TeII them that bone story.

79
00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:34,272
-I have to go to China.
-The country?

80
00:06:35,344 --> 00:06:39,440
No, this big piIe of dishes
in my mom's breakfront.

81
00:06:40,382 --> 00:06:42,282
Do you know who CarI is?

82
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:46,481
Let's see. AIvin, Simon, Theodore....
No.

83
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:51,258
RacheI's having
drinks with him tonight.

84
00:06:51,293 --> 00:06:54,490
How can she, when she's never
shown interest in you?

85
00:06:55,397 --> 00:06:58,264
-Forget about her.
-He's right.

86
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:01,302
PIease move on. Go to China.
Eat Chinese food.

87
00:07:01,437 --> 00:07:04,429
Of course, there
they just caII it ''food.''

88
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,403
Yeah, I guess. I don't know.

89
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:12,339
AII right, just give her this
for me, okay?

90
00:07:12,448 --> 00:07:16,316
We're Iooking out for you.
We want you to be happy.

91
00:07:16,418 --> 00:07:21,219
I may onIy have a coupIe beers
in me, but I Iove you.

92
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:24,453
I'm stiII on my first.

93
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:30,227
I just think you're nice.

94
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:40,431
That's when we started
this fruit basket business.

95
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:45,345
We caII ourseIves
''The Three Basketeers.''

96
00:07:45,447 --> 00:07:49,247
Like ''The Three Musketeers,''
onIy with fruit.

97
00:07:55,357 --> 00:07:58,349
-How do you want your burgers?
-Presents first!

98
00:07:58,393 --> 00:08:01,294
We're doing presents first.

99
00:08:02,498 --> 00:08:07,197
Hey, hoId on there, tiger.
How are you hoIding up?

100
00:08:07,302 --> 00:08:11,204
WeII, not so good.
She thinks tonight we're gonna...

101
00:08:11,306 --> 00:08:15,333
...compIete the transaction,
if you know what-- And you do.

102
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:19,312
Have you ever thought about
being there for her?

103
00:08:19,448 --> 00:08:21,416
What do you mean?

104
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,451
You know, just be there for her.

105
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:32,418
Not foIIowing you.

106
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:37,455
Think about it.

107
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:47,504
Okay. I'm guessing this is from....

108
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:54,247
-Thank you, MeIanie.
-This one right here is from me.

109
00:08:54,349 --> 00:08:59,286
Okay. It's Iight. It rattIes.

110
00:08:59,354 --> 00:09:00,286
It's...

111
00:09:02,224 --> 00:09:04,283
...TraveI ScrabbIe!

112
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:09,296
Thank you.

113
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:14,334
This one's from Joey.

114
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:19,340
It feeIs Iike a book, I think it's
a book. And it's a book!

115
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:21,399
It's Dr. Seuss!

116
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:26,313
That book got me through
some tough times.

117
00:09:26,448 --> 00:09:29,349
There's a IittIe chiId
inside this man.

118
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:33,320
The doctors say if they remove it,
he'II die.

119
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:37,415
-Who's this from?
-From Ross.

120
00:09:43,465 --> 00:09:47,526
Oh, my God! He remembered!

121
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:51,238
-Remembered what?
-It was months ago.

122
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,468
We waIked by this antique store.
I saw this pin.

123
00:09:55,243 --> 00:09:59,441
I toId him it was Iike one
my grandma had when I was IittIe.

124
00:10:00,248 --> 00:10:02,375
I can't beIieve he remembered!

125
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:06,353
WeII, sure, but can you
pIay it on a pIane?

126
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,296
It's so pretty!
This must've cost him a fortune.

127
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,388
I can't beIieve it.

128
00:10:16,465 --> 00:10:19,457
Remember when he
feII in Iove with CaroI...

129
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:23,362
...and bought her that
expensive crystaI duck?

130
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:26,303
What did you just say?

131
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:39,477
CrystaI duck.

132
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:48,591
No, no, no. The ''Iove'' part?

133
00:10:55,404 --> 00:11:01,240
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, no, no, no.

134
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:07,238
That's good. Just keep rubbing
your head. That'II turn back time.

135
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:16,449
This is unbeIievabIe.
I mean, this is unbeIievabIe!

136
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,454
I know.
This is reaIIy, reaIIy huge.

137
00:11:19,494 --> 00:11:24,363
No, it's not. It's smaII.
It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.

138
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,393
I don't think any of our Iives
wiII ever be the same ever again.

139
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:33,373
Is there a mute button on this woman?

140
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:37,377
I think this is so great.
I mean, you and Ross!

141
00:11:37,412 --> 00:11:40,381
-Did you have any idea?
-No, none!

142
00:11:40,482 --> 00:11:44,418
My first night in the city,
he mentioned asking me out...

143
00:11:44,486 --> 00:11:46,477
...but nothing ever happened.

144
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:50,285
What eIse did he say?
Does he wanna go out?

145
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:52,485
Given that he's in Iove with you...

146
00:11:52,594 --> 00:11:56,394
...he wouIdn't mind getting
a cup of coffee.

147
00:11:56,498 --> 00:12:01,435
Ross? AII this time?
I've gotta taIk to him.

148
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:04,471
-He's in China!
-The country.

149
00:12:08,276 --> 00:12:09,368
Is his fIight gone?

150
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,470
Yes! He's watching a woman do this:

151
00:12:13,248 --> 00:12:14,237
He's gone!

152
00:12:14,282 --> 00:12:16,477
His fIight doesn't Ieave
for 45 minutes.

153
00:12:17,285 --> 00:12:21,244
-What about time difference?
-From here to the airport?

154
00:12:22,357 --> 00:12:24,450
-You'II never make it!
-I've gotta try.

155
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,251
What'II you say to him?

156
00:12:27,295 --> 00:12:29,490
-I don't know.
-Then you shouIdn't go.

157
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:33,462
Right. If you're gonna
break his heart, that can wait.

158
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:36,260
But if it's good, teII him now.

159
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:41,274
-Maybe I'II know when I see him.
-AII right, does this heIp?

160
00:12:47,282 --> 00:12:52,379
No. Look, aII I know is, I cannot
wait a week. This is just too big.

161
00:12:52,487 --> 00:12:56,480
I've just gotta taIk to him.
Okay, I'II see you Iater.

162
00:12:56,525 --> 00:13:00,359
RacheI, I Iove you!
DeaI with me first!

163
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:14,230
AII right.

164
00:13:19,347 --> 00:13:23,249
-Ross! Excuse me, pardon me.
-Your boarding pass?

165
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:25,285
I need to taIk to my friend.

166
00:13:25,353 --> 00:13:29,346
Sorry, you're not aIIowed here
without a pass.

167
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:32,451
He's right there,
in the bIue jacket! Can I--?

168
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:34,489
I'm sorry. FederaI reguIations!

169
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:39,256
Then couId you pIease
just give him a message for me?

170
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:43,360
-This is very important.
-AII right. What's the message?

171
00:13:44,372 --> 00:13:46,306
I don't know.

172
00:13:48,276 --> 00:13:52,508
Excuse me, sir! Excuse me, sir?
I have a message for you.

173
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:57,377
RacheI Ioved the present.
She'II see you when you get back.

174
00:13:57,485 --> 00:13:59,316
What?

175
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:03,315
Toby, I don't know
what she's taIking about.

176
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:07,521
There's no RacheI.
Don't give me that deep freeze.

177
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:21,272
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!

178
00:14:21,376 --> 00:14:25,244
I think I bIacked out there
for a minute.

179
00:14:26,248 --> 00:14:28,239
It was nothing.

180
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:32,343
WeII, now we gotta
find something fun for you.

181
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,287
You know what?

182
00:14:39,294 --> 00:14:42,491
Forget about me.
Let's give you another turn.

183
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:49,303
-Me, again?
-Sure. Why not?

184
00:14:51,506 --> 00:14:57,502
Boy, somebody's gonna get
a big fruit basket tomorrow!

185
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:06,444
I gotta teII you, you are nothing Iike
I thought you'd be.

186
00:15:07,222 --> 00:15:08,314
How do you mean?

187
00:15:08,423 --> 00:15:13,224
I had you pegged as a guy
who's aIways, ''Me, me, me!''

188
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:16,354
But you, you're a giver.

189
00:15:17,532 --> 00:15:20,433
You're the most generous man
I ever met.

190
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:23,534
I mean, you're practicaIIy a woman.

191
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:35,245
-You're just saying that.
-No.

192
00:15:36,484 --> 00:15:38,349
<i>A woman!</i>

193
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:51,457
-So?
-I missed him.

194
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:54,366
-I'm so sorry.
-That's too bad.

195
00:15:54,402 --> 00:15:56,302
Yeah, right.

196
00:15:56,504 --> 00:15:58,495
No, I feeI bad for her. I do.

197
00:15:59,307 --> 00:16:02,401
I can think of somebody
other than myseIf.

198
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:04,435
AII right, I'm going to bed.

199
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:09,442
-Happy birthday. Hang in there.
-Thanks.

200
00:16:10,452 --> 00:16:11,441
Yes!

201
00:16:14,322 --> 00:16:15,346
Pizza coupons.

202
00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:24,355
Okay. You guys want heIp
cIeaning up this mess?

203
00:16:24,432 --> 00:16:26,332
That'd be great.

204
00:16:29,437 --> 00:16:32,463
So, Rach, you wanna save
this wrapping paper?

205
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:37,473
Are you gonna go for it with Ross
or shouId I throw it out?

206
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:44,441
I don't know. I don't know.

207
00:16:44,486 --> 00:16:47,353
Thought about it
aII the way there...

208
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:52,349
...and I thought about it aII the way
back. You know, it's Ross!

209
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,258
You know what I mean? It's Ross.

210
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:57,263
-Sure!
-Sure.

211
00:16:57,298 --> 00:17:02,292
I don't know. This is just
my initiaI gut feeIing...

212
00:17:03,204 --> 00:17:07,197
...but I'm thinking
it'd be reaIIy great.

213
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:10,439
Oh, my God, me too!
We'd be Iike friends-in-Iaw!

214
00:17:12,213 --> 00:17:15,239
The best part is you aIready
know aII about him.

215
00:17:15,316 --> 00:17:17,341
You start on the 1 5th date.

216
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:21,252
But it wouId be Iike
starting on the 1 5th date.

217
00:17:22,223 --> 00:17:24,214
Another good point.

218
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:28,320
I mean, on the 1 5th date,
you're aIready in a very...

219
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,456
...''reIationship-y'' pIace.
You're committed.

220
00:17:35,336 --> 00:17:37,429
What happens if it doesn't work out?

221
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:40,469
-Why isn't it working out?
-Sometimes it doesn't.

222
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:44,473
Is he not cute enough?
Does he not make enough money?

223
00:17:45,246 --> 00:17:48,238
-No, I'm just--
-Maybe there's someone eIse.

224
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:52,481
-Is there someone eIse?
-No, there is no one eIse.

225
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:55,449
Then why are you dumping my brother?

226
00:18:06,334 --> 00:18:09,201
Hey, big-- Spender!

227
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:13,401
She's stiII asIeep.

228
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:18,339
-So how'd it go?
-You know how you think you're great?

229
00:18:18,413 --> 00:18:22,406
The fact you'd even ask
shows how IittIe you know me.

230
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:27,450
Last night I couIdn't do the thing
that usuaIIy makes me great.

231
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,316
So I had to do aII this other stuff.

232
00:18:30,425 --> 00:18:33,326
And the response I got! Man, oh, man!

233
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:36,420
It was Iike a ticker-tape parade!

234
00:18:37,465 --> 00:18:42,425
I know. My room's very, very cIose
to the parade route.

235
00:18:47,275 --> 00:18:50,438
It was amazing, and not just for her.
For me too!

236
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:54,272
It's Iike, aII of a sudden
I'm bIind...

237
00:18:54,349 --> 00:18:57,284
...but aII my other senses
are heightened.

238
00:18:57,385 --> 00:19:00,286
It's Iike I was abIe
to appreciate it...

239
00:19:00,388 --> 00:19:02,322
...on another IeveI.

240
00:19:05,226 --> 00:19:10,186
-I didn't know you had another IeveI.
-I know. Neither did I!

241
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:15,202
Is something going on with O.J.?

242
00:19:25,346 --> 00:19:28,213
Hey, great skirt. Birthday present?

243
00:19:28,249 --> 00:19:29,307
-From who?
-You.

244
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,251
I exchanged the bIouse you got me.

245
00:19:33,354 --> 00:19:35,219
WeII, it's the thought.

246
00:19:35,523 --> 00:19:40,324
Doesn't Ross' fIight get in
in a coupIe hours? At gate 27B?

247
00:19:41,462 --> 00:19:46,263
Yeah. Monica, you know, I've been
thinking about it.

248
00:19:46,334 --> 00:19:49,428
I've decided this Ross thing
is not a good idea.

249
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,459
Why?

250
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:54,436
I feeI Iike I wouIdn't
just be going out with him.

251
00:19:54,475 --> 00:19:58,434
I'd be going out with aII of you.
There'd be pressure--

252
00:19:58,546 --> 00:20:00,446
No pressure, no pressure!

253
00:20:02,383 --> 00:20:05,352
Nothing has happened,
and you're aIready so--

254
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:09,345
I'm not ''so.'' Okay, I was a teensy
bit weird at first...

255
00:20:09,457 --> 00:20:12,483
...but I'II be good. I promise.

256
00:20:17,498 --> 00:20:20,365
-Who is it?
<i>-It's me, Carl.</i>

257
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:23,369
-Come on up.
-Behind my brother's back?

258
00:20:25,373 --> 00:20:30,367
Is the kind of crazy thing
you won't be hearing from me.

259
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,484
-Seven hundred bucks!
-AII right, you did it!

260
00:20:45,526 --> 00:20:48,290
Do we have any fruit?

261
00:20:50,398 --> 00:20:52,389
Man, heII of a two weeks.

262
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,435
You know what?
I feeI I Iearned something.

263
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:58,404
You'II stick with this
''aII for her'' thing?

264
00:20:58,439 --> 00:21:00,270
What are you, crazy?

265
00:21:00,441 --> 00:21:05,435
When a bIind man gets his sight back,
does he waIk around Iike this?

266
00:21:10,385 --> 00:21:14,253
If I see one more picture
of Ed BegIey Jr...

267
00:21:14,355 --> 00:21:18,485
...in that stupid eIectric car,
I'm gonna shoot myseIf!

268
00:21:20,261 --> 00:21:23,492
I'm not against
environmentaI issues, per se...

269
00:21:24,265 --> 00:21:25,459
...it's just that guy!

270
00:21:26,301 --> 00:21:30,260
I can't beIieve you'd rather
go out with him than me.

271
00:21:30,471 --> 00:21:33,406
Excuse me, I'm trying
to have a date here.

272
00:21:34,275 --> 00:21:37,267
Fine. Just stop thinking about me.

273
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,505
Can't do it, can you?

274
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:44,576
I'm thinking about you. So what?

275
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,380
I don't get it.
What do you see in this guy?

276
00:21:49,424 --> 00:21:52,291
Happens to be a very nice guy.

277
00:21:52,327 --> 00:21:55,387
I mean, come on, buddy!
Get a reaI car!

278
00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:02,233
RacheI, come on. Give us a chance.

279
00:22:02,437 --> 00:22:04,337
Ross, it's too hard.

280
00:22:04,372 --> 00:22:09,275
Why, because it'II get weird
for everyone eIse? This is about us.

281
00:22:09,377 --> 00:22:12,471
I've been in Iove with you
since the ninth grade.

282
00:22:13,281 --> 00:22:17,479
You're Iike my best friend.
If we broke up, and I Iost you--

283
00:22:18,252 --> 00:22:19,480
What makes you think that?

284
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:24,349
Have you been invoIved
where you haven't broken up?

285
00:22:26,394 --> 00:22:27,361
No.

286
00:22:28,363 --> 00:22:32,265
But it onIy has to happen once.

287
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:37,270
You and I both know we are perfect
for each other. Right?

288
00:22:37,372 --> 00:22:41,468
So the onIy question is:
Are you attracted to me?

289
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,478
I don't know.

290
00:22:46,381 --> 00:22:49,316
I mean, I've never Iooked at you
that way before.

291
00:22:50,284 --> 00:22:51,410
WeII, start Iooking.

292
00:23:02,363 --> 00:23:04,354
-Wow.
-ExactIy!

293
00:23:04,432 --> 00:23:06,423
And I'm gonna be the guy...

294
00:23:07,235 --> 00:23:10,261
...caught behind this hammerhead
in traffic!

295
00:23:12,373 --> 00:23:15,240
Right! You're right.

296
00:23:16,244 --> 00:23:17,233
You know what?

297
00:23:17,278 --> 00:23:20,372
I'm supposed to pick up
a friend at the airport.

298
00:23:20,448 --> 00:23:22,439
I am so sorry!

299
00:23:23,251 --> 00:23:26,277
If you wanna finish your drinks,
pIease do.

300
00:23:26,387 --> 00:23:29,481
-I'm sorry, I gotta go. I'm sorry.
-But....

301
00:23:35,363 --> 00:23:38,298
-Where are you going?
-To get Ross.

302
00:23:38,366 --> 00:23:40,459
-My God, this is so exciting!
-I know.

303
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:45,365
If you want the rest of my date,
I'm not gonna finish it.

304
00:23:45,473 --> 00:23:51,309
-RacheI, he's not a sandwich.
-No, he's a banker with opera tickets.

305
00:23:52,413 --> 00:23:54,381
HeIIo!

306
00:23:57,585 --> 00:23:59,485
-Where you going?
-Airport.

307
00:24:00,254 --> 00:24:03,314
You can't teII him.
There's so much I haven't done.

308
00:24:03,357 --> 00:24:06,349
I haven't watched <i>Baywatch</i>
with Yasmine BIeeth!

309
00:24:08,262 --> 00:24:12,221
ChandIer, reIax. This is a good
going to the airport.

310
00:24:12,433 --> 00:24:16,335
Oh, weII then fIy, good woman,
fIy Iike the wind.

311
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,339
-I'm fIying!
-TeII him I'm the one who bIew it!

312
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:25,444
Yes, another successfuI case
for the Iove doctor.

313
00:24:34,255 --> 00:24:37,349
Excuse me! Pardon me.
Excuse me. Sorry.

314
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:41,285
Toby, for God's sake,
wiII you Iet it go?

315
00:24:41,395 --> 00:24:42,555
There's no RacheI!

316
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:50,503
Hey! I got that.

317
00:24:51,372 --> 00:24:53,397
-Thanks, sweetie.
-No probIem.

318
00:24:59,413 --> 00:25:02,246
I can't wait for you
to meet my friends.

319
00:25:02,316 --> 00:25:05,217
You don't think they'II judge me?

320
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:08,220
-No, they wiII. I just....
-Can't wait!

321
00:25:08,322 --> 00:25:10,415
Come on, they're gonna Iove you.
