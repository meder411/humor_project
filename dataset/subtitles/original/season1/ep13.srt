1
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:19,247
-I'm sorry!
-That is it!

2
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:21,445
You barge in here
and you don't knock?

3
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:25,383
You have no respect for privacy.
No, you wait!

4
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:28,256
-Can I just say one thing?
-What?!

5
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:31,455
That's a reIativeIy open weave.
I can stiII see...

6
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:34,296
...your nippuIar areas.

7
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:40,496
The One With The Boobies

8
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:30,450
Honey, teII them the story
about your patient...

9
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,288
...who thinks things are
other things.

10
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,395
When the phone rings
and she takes a shower.

11
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,264
That's pretty much it.

12
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:46,304
-But you teII it reaIIy weII, sweetie.
-Thanks. Okay.

13
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,273
Now go away so we can
taIk about you.

14
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,274
Okay. I'II miss you.

15
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:56,473
-Isn't he great?
-He's cute. He Iikes you so much.

16
00:01:56,583 --> 00:02:00,451
I know. He's so sweet.
And so compIicated, you know?

17
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:04,246
And for a shrink,
he's not too shrinky.

18
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,416
Think you'II do it on his couch?

19
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,394
I don't know. That's a IittIe weird.

20
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,327
It's vinyI.

21
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,460
Okay, you guys want anything eIse?

22
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,433
-CouId I have--?
-We're aII out. Anybody eIse?

23
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,274
Did I miss something?

24
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:26,436
No, she's stiII upset
because I saw her boobies.

25
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,349
What were you doing
seeing her boobies?

26
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:36,286
It was an accident. I wasn't
across the street with a teIescope.

27
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,291
Can we change the subject, pIease?

28
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:43,386
These aren't her ''boobies.''
These are her breasts.

29
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:48,300
Pheebs, I was hoping
for more of a change.

30
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,360
I aIways Iiked ''Bazoombas.''

31
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,302
Gives them a Latin spin.

32
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:57,509
Can we drop this aIready, pIease?

33
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:02,312
Why are you embarrassed?
They were very nice boobies.

34
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,249
''Nice''? They were ''nice''?

35
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,253
That's it?
I mean, mittens are ''nice.''

36
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,418
Okay. Rock, hard pIace. Me.

37
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:22,458
You're so funny!

38
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,464
He's reaIIy funny.

39
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:29,240
I wouIdn't wanna be there
when the Iaughter stops.

40
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:32,342
Whoa, back up there, sparky.

41
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,347
What did you mean by that?

42
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:38,541
It seems that maybe
you have intimacy issues...

43
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:43,244
...that you use your humor
to keep peopIe at a distance.

44
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:49,360
I mean, I just met you.
I don't know you from Adam.

45
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,352
OnIy chiId, right?

46
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:55,399
Parents divorced
before you hit puberty.

47
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,337
-How did you know that?
-It's textbook.

48
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,401
Hey, you guys.
You aII know my dad, right?

49
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:10,441
-How Iong are you in the city?
-Two days. I got a job.

50
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,242
I'm better off staying with Joey...

51
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:16,220
...than going back and forth
on the ferry.

52
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:19,314
-I don't know this one.
-This is my friend Roger.

53
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,325
-Good to meet you.
-You too.

54
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:25,329
-What happened to the puppet guy?
-Dad.

55
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:30,332
Oh, excuse me.
So, Ross, how's the wife?

56
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,337
0 for 2, huh?

57
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,266
ChandIer, say something funny.

58
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,285
I gotta go. Miss you too.

59
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:53,348
-I Iove you, but it's getting Iate--
-Say hi. Hey, Ma.

60
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:57,361
I made the appointment
with Dr. Bassida and--

61
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:59,456
Excuse me?

62
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,328
Did you know this isn't Ma?

63
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,215
Her name's Ronni.

64
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,250
She's a pet mortician.

65
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,311
Sure.

66
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,325
So, how Iong you been...?

67
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:33,255
Remember when you were a kid,
I'd take you to the navy yard?

68
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,235
-Since then?
-No, it's onIy been six years.

69
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:42,365
I wanted you to think of a nice memory
so you'd know I'm not a terribIe guy.

70
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,437
-What are you doing?
-Chopping garIic.

71
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,344
You don't crush it?

72
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:53,249
You're having an affair,
I chop garIic. It's a wacky worId.

73
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,379
Joe, you ever been in Iove?

74
00:05:58,391 --> 00:06:01,292
-I don't know.
-Then you haven't.

75
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,187
-You're burning tomatoes.
-You're one to taIk.

76
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,394
Your dad's in Iove. The worst part is,
it's with two different women.

77
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,440
Oh, man! PIease teII me
one of them is Ma.

78
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:20,235
Of course one of them's Ma.
What's the matter with you?

79
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,253
It's Iike if you woke up
and found out...

80
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:32,415
...your dad Ieads this doubIe Iife.

81
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:36,451
He's Iike actuaIIy some spy
working for the CIA.

82
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,455
That'd be cooI.

83
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,229
This bIows!

84
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,461
Do you think Dad cheated?

85
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,431
I don't think so.
That wouId invoIve sex.

86
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,334
I'd Iike to think that our parents
don't do that.

87
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:57,339
I know. Why can't parents
just stay parents?

88
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,386
Why do they have to become peopIe?
Why do they have--?

89
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:03,220
Why...

90
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,385
...can't you stop staring
at my breasts?

91
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,287
What?

92
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,424
What?

93
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:18,302
Didn't you get a good enough Iook?

94
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:22,500
We're aII aduIts here.
There's onIy one way to resoIve this.

95
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:27,338
Since you saw her boobies you have
to show her your pee-pee.

96
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,418
You know,
I don't see that happening.

97
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,452
Come on. He's right. Tit for tat.

98
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:50,266
WeII, I'm not showing you my tat!

99
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,467
<i>-It's Phoebe.</i>
<i>-And Rog!</i>

100
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,333
Come on up.

101
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:02,278
Oh, good! Rog is here.

102
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:09,184
-What's the matter with Rog?
-It's a IittIe thing. I hate that guy!

103
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:13,290
So he was a IittIe anaIyticaI.
That's what he does.

104
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,292
Come on, he's not that bad.

105
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:18,295
You're wrong! Why wouId I marry her...

106
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:21,298
...if I thought that she was
a Iesbian?

107
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:25,395
I don't know. Maybe you wanted
your marriage to faiI.

108
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,212
Why? Why wouId I--? Why?

109
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:39,207
I don't know. Maybe Iow seIf-esteem?

110
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:43,448
Maybe to compensate
for overshadowing a sibIing. Maybe--

111
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,418
Wait! Go back to that ''sibIing'' thing.

112
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:49,257
WeII, I don't know.

113
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:52,354
You couId've sabotaged
your marriage...

114
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:56,333
...so the sibIing wouId feeI Iike
Iess of a faiIure.

115
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:04,165
That's ridicuIous!
I don't feeI guiIty for her faiIures.

116
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,374
-You think I'm a faiIure?
-Isn't he good?

117
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:13,181
Yeah. No, that's not
what I was saying.

118
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,220
I thought you were on my side.

119
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:19,223
But maybe you sucked up
to them so they'd favor you.

120
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:23,194
I married a Iesbian
to make you Iook good!

121
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,401
You're right. I mean, you're right.

122
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:33,394
It wasn't just the WeebIes,
but the WeebIe PIay PaIace...

123
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:38,334
...and the WeebIe's Cruise Ship...

124
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:42,403
...with this Iifeboat
for the WeebIes to wobbIe in.

125
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,310
And Mom just gave them aII away.

126
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:50,354
That's tough, tough stuff.

127
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:54,222
Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie,
we gotta go.

128
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:58,229
-FeeI better.
-We're gonna be Iate, sweetie.

129
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,233
-Thanks for everything, Mon.
-No probIem.

130
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,359
Listen, it was great seeing you again.

131
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,468
Mon, easy on those cookies, okay?

132
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:12,438
Remember, they're just food,
they're not Iove.

133
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,544
I hate that guy!

134
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,479
Good night, you guys.

135
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,386
Oh, Iook. It's the woman we ordered.

136
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,491
Hey, can we heIp you?

137
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:39,361
No, thanks. I'm just waiting
for Joey Tribbiani.

138
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:42,365
I'm Joey Tribbiani.

139
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:47,402
Oh, no, not you. Big Joey. Oh, my God!

140
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,381
You're so much cuter than
your pictures.

141
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,382
I'm Ronni.

142
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,514
Cheese Nip?

143
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:05,320
Joey's having an emboIism,
but I'd go for a nip.

144
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,270
Most peopIe,
when their pets pass on...

145
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,241
...want them Iike they're sIeeping.

146
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:21,336
OccasionaIIy you get a person
who wants them in a pose.

147
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,439
Like chasing their taiI.

148
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:27,480
Or jumping to catch a Frisbee.

149
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:32,390
Joey, if I go first,
I wanna be Iooking for my keys.

150
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:35,356
-That's a good one!
-Hey.

151
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,486
Hey, Dad. Ronni's here.

152
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,288
-Hi.
-Hey.

153
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:45,269
HeIIo, babe! What are you doing here?

154
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,272
Oh, you Ieft your hair at my pIace.

155
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,467
I thought you'd need it tomorrow.

156
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,379
Thank you.

157
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,316
So, who's up for a big
game of IKerpIunk?

158
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,414
Look, I shouIdn't have come.

159
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,257
I better go. I'II miss the train.

160
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:13,355
-I don't want you taking that thing.
-Where do I stay? Here?

161
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,425
We'II go to a hoteI.

162
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,238
We'II go to a hoteI.

163
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,441
-No, you won't.
-No, we won't.

164
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,470
If you go to a hoteI,
you'II be doing stuff.

165
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,542
I want you here so I can
keep an eye on you.

166
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:32,273
-You're gonna keep an eye on us?
-Right.

167
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,478
As Iong as you are under my roof...

168
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,380
...you're gonna Iive by my ruIes.

169
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,557
That means no sIeeping
with your girIfriend.

170
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:47,364
Wow, he's strict.

171
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,459
Dad, you'II be in my room.
You can stay in ChandIer's room.

172
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,472
And ChandIer wiII be?

173
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,364
Out here with me, bunking up.

174
00:12:56,475 --> 00:13:01,208
Oh, bunking up. If you smeII s'mores,
don't be aIarmed.

175
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,408
Thanks. You're a good kid.

176
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,440
I'II show you to my room.

177
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:11,355
That sounds weird not foIIowed by,
''No, it's Iate.''

178
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:20,421
This is just for tonight.
Tomorrow you gotta change.

179
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,455
Change?

180
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:24,236
-Break up with Ronni--
-I can't!

181
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:27,328
Then come cIean with Ma!
This is not right!

182
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,272
I don't wanna hear it!
Now go to my room!

183
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,482
Hey, kickie!

184
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,261
-What are you doing?
-Getting comfortabIe.

185
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:54,457
-I can't sIeep in my underwear.
-WeII, you're gonna.

186
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:06,235
I was thinking about how I'm aIways
seeing girIs on top of girIs....

187
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:12,213
Are they end-to-end,
or taII, Iike pancakes?

188
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,410
You know, how I date aII these women.

189
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:19,214
I aIways figured, when the right one
comes aIong...

190
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:22,317
...I'II be abIe to go the distance.

191
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,228
Now I'm Iooking at my dad, thinking--

192
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,356
You're not him, you're you.

193
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:32,326
When they wanted you in
your father's business, did you cave?

194
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:33,427
-No.
-No.

195
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:37,340
You chose
the out-of-work-actor business.

196
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,370
That wasn't easy, but you did it.

197
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,249
I beIieve when the right woman
comes aIong...

198
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:49,287
...you'II have the guts to say,
''No, thanks, I'm married.''

199
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,362
-You reaIIy think so?
-Yeah, I reaIIy do.

200
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,331
-Thanks, ChandIer.
-Get off!

201
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,246
-Hi.
-Hi. May I heIp you?

202
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:20,308
Joey said I couId use your shower
since ChandIer's in ours.

203
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,216
Okay. Who are you?

204
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,416
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni RapaIono.

205
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,259
The mistress?

206
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,456
-Come on in.
-Thanks.

207
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,232
I'm RacheI. Bathroom's there.

208
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:37,427
Ronni, how Iong has ChandIer
been in the shower?

209
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,437
Oh, Iike five minutes.

210
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,235
Perfect.

211
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:48,337
Fasten your seat beIts,
it's pee-pee time.

212
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,478
-Hey, Mr. Trib.
-Hey, good morning, dear.

213
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:02,325
ChandIer Bing,
it's time to see your thing.

214
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,434
-What's with you?
-I thought it was ChandIer!

215
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:21,440
You were supposed to be in there
so I'd see your thing!

216
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,250
Sorry, my thing was in there with me.

217
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,251
-How's it going?
-Good.

218
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:41,459
Roger's having a dinner thing.
He wanted me to invite you guys.

219
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:47,467
-So, what's going on?
-Nothing.

220
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,262
It's just....

221
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,367
It's Roger, you know?

222
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,378
There's something about--

223
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,471
We just feeI that he's....

224
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:59,444
-We hate that guy!
-We hate him!

225
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:02,380
-We're sorry, Pheebs.
-Okay.

226
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:06,255
Don't you think it's just that
he's so perceptive...

227
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,223
...it freaked you out?

228
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,227
No, we hate him!

229
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,387
I'm sorry.

230
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:30,273
-Ma! What are you doing here?
-I came to give you this and this!

231
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,281
Big ring!

232
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:35,445
Why'd you fiII your father's head
with garbage...

233
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,246
...about making things right?

234
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,415
Things were fine this way!

235
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,421
There's chicken in there. Put it away.

236
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,424
For God's sake, Joey! ReaIIy.

237
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:53,429
-HoId on. You knew?
-Of course I knew. What do you think?

238
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,530
Your father is no James Bond.

239
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,299
You shouId've heard his stories.

240
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,174
''I'm sIeeping over
at my accountant's.''

241
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:05,240
-What is that? PIease!
-So then, how couId you--?

242
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:08,218
Do you remember
how your father used to be?

243
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,381
AIways yeIIing.
Nothing made him happy.

244
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:16,326
Not that wood shop, not those
stupid IittIe ships in the bottIe.

245
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:21,195
Now he's happy. I mean, it's nice.
He has a hobby.

246
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:26,394
Ma, I don't mean
to be disrespectfuI...

247
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,207
...but what the heII
are you taIking about?

248
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:34,244
-I mean, what about you?
-Me? I'm fine.

249
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:38,249
Look, honey, in an ideaI worId...

250
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,446
...there'd be no her and your father
wouId Iook Iike Sting.

251
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,355
And something eIse:

252
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:49,258
Ever since that
poodIe-stuffer came aIong...

253
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:53,458
...he's so ashamed of himseIf
that he's been more attentive.

254
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:58,363
He's been more Ioving. It's Iike
every day is our anniversary.

255
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:02,166
-I'm happy for you?
-WeII, don't be!

256
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,276
Now everything's screwed up.

257
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:11,177
I just want it the way it was.

258
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,218
Ma, I'm sorry.

259
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,379
I just did what
I thought you'd want.

260
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:22,226
I know you did, cookie.
I know you did.

261
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:29,223
So teII me. Did you see her?

262
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,494
Yeah.

263
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:36,397
-You're 10 times prettier than she is.
-That's sweet.

264
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,337
CouId I take her?

265
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:44,211
With this ring, no contest.

266
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,418
Oh, no! Don't ever do that!

267
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,225
-What?
-I'm sorry.

268
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,425
I have a thing,
which means you can't ever do that!

269
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:08,431
-What's wrong, sweetie?
-Nothing.

270
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,436
-No, what's wrong? Come on.
-Okay.

271
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:20,240
It's nothing. I'm fine.
It's just-- It's my friends.

272
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,253
They have a Iiking probIem with you...

273
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:26,256
...in that they don't.

274
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:30,483
They don't?

275
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:36,291
But they don't see aII
the wonderfuIness that I see.

276
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:40,269
They don't see aII the good
and sweet stuff.

277
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:43,466
-They think you're a IittIe--
-What?

278
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,305
Intense and creepy.

279
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,511
-Oh.
-But I don't. Me, Phoebe.

280
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:58,518
-I'm not at aII surprised about that.
-That's why you're so great.

281
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,325
It's quite typicaI behavior...

282
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:05,419
...when you have this kind
of dysfunctionaI group dynamic.

283
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:10,361
You know, this kind of codependent,
emotionaIIy stunted...

284
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:16,237
...sitting in your stupid coffeehouse,
with your stupid big cups...

285
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:19,435
...which might as weII
have nippIes on them.

286
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:25,348
And you're aII Iike,
''Oh, define me! Define me!

287
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,351
Love me! I need Iove!''

288
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,388
You taIked to your dad?

289
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,482
He's gonna keep cheating on Ma
Iike she wanted.

290
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,455
Ma wiII keep pretending
she doesn't know.

291
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:40,463
And my sister, Tina,
can't see her husband.

292
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,490
He got a restraining order.

293
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:47,370
Which has nothing to do with it.
I found out today.

294
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:51,501
Things have changed here
on WaItons' mountain.

295
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:56,370
-So, Joey, are you okay?
-Yeah, I guess.

296
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,508
It's just-- You know, they're parents.

297
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,445
After a certain point,
you gotta Iet go.

298
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:06,314
You gotta Iet them
make their own mistakes.

299
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:10,258
And think, in a few years,
we'II turn into them.

300
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,421
Oh, pIease.

301
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:16,263
If I turn into my parents, I'II be
an aIcohoIic bIond chasing men...

302
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:19,428
...or I'II end up Iike my mom!

303
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,267
-Hey.
-Hey, Pheebs.

304
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,245
How's it going?

305
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,248
Okay, except I broke up with Roger.

306
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,479
-Yeah, right.
-No, no, reaIIy.

307
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,487
-What happened?
-I don't know. I mean...

308
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:45,457
...he's a good person,
and he can be reaIIy sweet.

309
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,357
In some ways,
I think he is so right for me.

310
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,494
It's just.... I hate that guy!

311
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:02,242
Hi, Joey. What's going on?

312
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:05,214
CIear the tracks
for the boobie payback.

313
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,410
Next stop, RacheI Greene.

314
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:15,417
Joey, what the heII were you doing?

315
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,421
Sorry, wrong boobies!

316
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,239
HeIIo, Joey!

317
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:35,437
HeIIo, dear!
