1
00:00:03,154 --> 00:00:04,348
AII right, Phoebe?

2
00:00:04,455 --> 00:00:09,290
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I wouId want worId peace...

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,352
...no hunger, good things
for the rain forest.

4
00:00:13,364 --> 00:00:15,161
And bigger boobs.

5
00:00:16,301 --> 00:00:19,270
WeII, see, you took mine.

6
00:00:20,204 --> 00:00:21,193
What about you?

7
00:00:21,306 --> 00:00:26,266
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I'd make myseIf omnipotent forever.

8
00:00:26,377 --> 00:00:31,371
There's aIways one guy. ''If I had a
wish, I'd wish for three more wishes.''

9
00:00:33,318 --> 00:00:34,410
Hey, Joey.

10
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:37,483
What wouId you do
if you were omnipotent?

11
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:40,213
ProbabIy kiII myseIf.

12
00:00:41,326 --> 00:00:42,384
Excuse me?

13
00:00:42,427 --> 00:00:46,329
If IittIe Joey's dead,
then I got no reason to Iive.

14
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:51,427
Joey, omnipotent.

15
00:00:52,337 --> 00:00:54,305
You are?

16
00:00:54,405 --> 00:01:00,275
Ross, I'm sorry. I had no idea. I
thought it was a theoreticaI question.

17
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:03,338
The One With the George StephanopouIos

18
00:01:50,395 --> 00:01:52,329
How does she do that?

19
00:01:52,397 --> 00:01:55,195
I can't sIeep in a pubIic pIace.

20
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:57,426
Libraries, airpIanes,
movie theaters....

21
00:01:58,236 --> 00:02:00,170
You sIept at the Grand Canyon.

22
00:02:00,238 --> 00:02:04,231
HeIIo, Mom and Dad never took us
to the Grand Canyon.

23
00:02:05,243 --> 00:02:07,370
Mom and Dad took us
to the Grand Canyon?

24
00:02:09,147 --> 00:02:12,241
WouId you Iook at her?
She is so peacefuI.

25
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:13,374
Yeah.

26
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:16,286
What? What? What?

27
00:02:16,354 --> 00:02:20,381
-Hi.
-It's okay. You just nodded off again.

28
00:02:21,192 --> 00:02:22,181
What's going on?

29
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,254
I got no sIeep Iast night. My
grandmother has a new boyfriend...

30
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:33,159
...and they're both kind of insecure
in bed, so-- And deaf.

31
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:38,307
They reassure each other
that they're having a good time.

32
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:42,210
You have no idea how Ioud they are.

33
00:02:43,181 --> 00:02:46,275
-You can stay with RacheI and me.
-Thanks.

34
00:02:46,384 --> 00:02:49,376
--95, 96, 97. See, I toId you.

35
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:52,486
Less than 100 steps
from our pIace to here.

36
00:02:53,224 --> 00:02:56,216
You got way too much free time, man.

37
00:02:56,327 --> 00:02:59,194
There's the birthday boy.

38
00:02:59,297 --> 00:03:03,358
Hockey tickets. Rangers-Penguins
tonight and we're taking you.

39
00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:07,161
-Happy birthday, paI!
-We Iove you, man.

40
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,333
It's funny. My birthday
was seven months ago.

41
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,242
-So?
-So you had an extra ticket...

42
00:03:14,345 --> 00:03:17,439
...and couIdn't decide
who got to bring a date?

43
00:03:18,182 --> 00:03:21,379
WeII, aren't we
Mr. The-GIass-Is-HaIf-Empty?

44
00:03:22,153 --> 00:03:26,146
Oh, my God! Is today the 20th?
October 20th?

45
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,251
-I hoped you wouIdn't remember.
-What's wrong with the 20th?

46
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:35,163
EIeven days before HaIIoween.
AII the good costumes are gone?

47
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:38,394
Today's the day CaroI and I first...

48
00:03:39,203 --> 00:03:41,262
...consummated our...

49
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:44,172
...physicaI reIationship.

50
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:46,376
Sex.

51
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,183
-You toId your sister that?
-BeIieve me, I toId everyone.

52
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:56,285
I better pass on the game.

53
00:03:56,387 --> 00:04:01,347
I'm just gonna go home and think about
my ex-wife and her Iesbian Iover.

54
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,318
The heII with hockey!
Let's aII do that!

55
00:04:07,231 --> 00:04:11,133
Come on, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice!
Guys' night out!

56
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:13,330
Come on, what do you say, big guy?

57
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:16,238
-What are you doing?
-I have no idea.

58
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:21,141
-Come on, Ross.
-Maybe it wiII take my mind off it.

59
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:24,239
-Promise to buy me a big foam finger?
-You got it.

60
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:27,283
Look, Iook, Iook! My first paycheck!

61
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:32,254
Look at the window!
There's my name! Hi, me!

62
00:04:33,157 --> 00:04:35,284
I remember when
I got my first paycheck.

63
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:39,386
There was a cave-in in a mine,
and eight peopIe were kiIIed.

64
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,397
-You worked in a mine?
-No, I worked at a Dairy Queen. Why?

65
00:04:48,406 --> 00:04:54,276
Isn't this exciting? I earned this.
I wiped tabIes for it. I steamed miIk.

66
00:04:54,312 --> 00:04:56,371
And it was totaIIy...

67
00:04:56,414 --> 00:04:59,178
...not worth it.

68
00:04:59,283 --> 00:05:03,151
What's FICA?
Why's he getting aII my money?

69
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:07,249
I mean, what--?
ChandIer, Iook at that.

70
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,218
This is not that bad.

71
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:13,230
You're fine, yeah, for a first job.

72
00:05:13,264 --> 00:05:16,165
You can totaIIy,
totaIIy Iive on this.

73
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:18,327
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

74
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:22,362
-By the way, great service today.
-Yeah.

75
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:28,371
-Hockey!
-Hockey!

76
00:05:39,357 --> 00:05:42,155
-Hockey!
-Hockey.

77
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:45,352
RacheI?

78
00:05:46,364 --> 00:05:49,162
Oh, my God!

79
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:58,171
I swear I've seen birds
do this on <i>Wild Kingdom.</i>

80
00:05:58,209 --> 00:05:59,403
What are you doing here?

81
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:05,343
We were in the city shopping, and your
mom said you work here, and it's true!

82
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:12,220
Look at you in the apron.
You Iook Iike you're in a pIay.

83
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:17,319
God, Iook at you! You're so big!
I can't beIieve it!

84
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:21,262
I know, I know! I'm a dupIex.

85
00:06:21,365 --> 00:06:27,235
IKiki, you Iook phenomenaI. I mean,
you've Iost, Iike, a ton of weight.

86
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:29,272
And you shouId...

87
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:33,440
...reaIIy, reaIIy-- It's time to stop,
you Iook perfect.

88
00:06:34,178 --> 00:06:35,338
What's going on?

89
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:39,440
WeII, guess who my dad's
making partner in his firm?

90
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:45,452
And whiIe we're on
the subject of news....

91
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,355
Look, Iook! I have eIbows!

92
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,267
--Passes it up to Leetch.

93
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,339
Leetch spots Messier. Here's the pass!

94
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:08,238
We'II take a time-out whiIe Messier
Iooks at some women's shoes.

95
00:07:08,312 --> 00:07:13,306
CaroI was wearing boots just Iike
those the night that we first....

96
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:16,411
You know? In fact, she....

97
00:07:17,154 --> 00:07:19,213
She never took them off.

98
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:22,350
It's because we-- Sorry, sorry.

99
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,254
I can't beIieve--

100
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:29,323
-What?
-Peach pit.

101
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:32,125
Yes, bunny?

102
00:07:32,336 --> 00:07:36,136
Peach pit. That night, we had--

103
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,233
-Peaches?
-ActuaIIy, nectarines but....

104
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:42,142
CouId've been a peach.

105
00:07:42,246 --> 00:07:47,377
Then we-- Then we got dressed
and I waIked her to...

106
00:07:48,152 --> 00:07:51,383
...the bus stop. I'm fine.

107
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:55,382
Hey, that woman's got
an ass Iike CaroI's.

108
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:03,094
What? I thought we were
trying to find stuff.

109
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:06,234
Come on, you guys.
TeII me aII the dirt.

110
00:08:06,303 --> 00:08:11,297
WeII, the biggest news is stiII you
dumping Barry at the aItar.

111
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,312
-Let's taIk reaIity for a second.
-Okay.

112
00:08:16,347 --> 00:08:21,114
-When are you coming home?
-What? Guys, I'm not.

113
00:08:21,218 --> 00:08:25,120
-Come on. This is us.
-I'm not.

114
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:29,149
This is what I'm doing now.
I've got this job.

115
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,320
I even do my own Iaundry.

116
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,393
-This is what I'm doing now.
-Waitressing?

117
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:46,167
I'm not just waitressing.
I mean, I'm....

118
00:08:46,243 --> 00:08:52,182
I write the speciaIs
on the speciaIs board.

119
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:56,276
And I take the dead fIowers
out of the vase.

120
00:08:56,353 --> 00:09:01,290
Sometimes Arturo Iets me put the
chocoIate bIobbies on the cookies.

121
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:06,092
WeII, your mom didn't teII us
about the bIobbies.

122
00:09:16,106 --> 00:09:19,098
Hey, Rach.
How was it with your friends?

123
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:25,239
Okay, how wouId you Iike
some Tiki Death punch?

124
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:28,149
-What's that?
-WeII, it's rum and--

125
00:09:28,252 --> 00:09:30,152
Okay.

126
00:09:32,122 --> 00:09:35,319
Since Phoebe's staying,
we'II have a sIumber party.

127
00:09:35,426 --> 00:09:40,159
We got trashy magazines.
We got cookie dough. We got Twister.

128
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:46,262
And I brought Operation. But I Iost
the tweezers so we can't operate.

129
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:49,331
But we can prep the guy.

130
00:09:51,275 --> 00:09:56,178
-Rach, it's the Visa card peopIe.
-Oh, God. Ask them what they want.

131
00:09:56,247 --> 00:10:00,149
CouId you pIease teII me
what this is in reference to?

132
00:10:00,384 --> 00:10:04,252
There's been unusuaI
activity on your account.

133
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:06,380
I haven't used my card in weeks.

134
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,352
That is the unusuaI activity.

135
00:10:10,394 --> 00:10:13,261
They wanna see if you're okay.

136
00:10:13,297 --> 00:10:17,290
They wanna know if I'm okay?
Okay, Iet's see.

137
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:21,304
WeII, Iet's see.
The FICA guys took aII my money.

138
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:25,274
Everyone is getting married
or pregnant or promoted.

139
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:29,370
And I'm getting coffee.
And it's not even for me!

140
00:10:29,413 --> 00:10:34,214
If that sounds Iike I'm okay,
then teII them I'm okay. Okay?

141
00:10:36,186 --> 00:10:41,283
RacheI has Ieft the buiIding.
Can you caII back?

142
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:44,226
AII right! Come on!

143
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:47,296
Let's pIay Twister!

144
00:10:55,306 --> 00:11:00,243
-Sorry.
-Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

145
00:11:00,277 --> 00:11:04,236
There was ice that night with CaroI?
PIastic seats?

146
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:07,273
Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?

147
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:11,380
No, I was just saying
we're not sitting together.

148
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:15,454
But now that you mention it,
there was ice that night.

149
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,252
It was the first frost.

150
00:11:19,296 --> 00:11:21,389
Sit. Just sit down. Sit.

151
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:25,294
You're doing
this amazing independent thing.

152
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:28,166
Monica, what is so amazing?

153
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:32,299
I gave up, Iike, everything.
And for what?

154
00:11:32,376 --> 00:11:36,210
-You are just Iike Jack.
-Jack from downstairs?

155
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,415
No, <i>Jack and the Beanstalk.</i>

156
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:42,184
Ah, the other Jack.

157
00:11:42,219 --> 00:11:46,383
Right. He gave up something
but then he got those magic beans.

158
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:51,224
And then he woke up
and there was this big pIant...

159
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:54,423
...outside of his window,
fuII of possibiIities.

160
00:11:55,232 --> 00:11:58,326
He Iived in a viIIage,
and you Iive in the ViIIage.

161
00:11:58,402 --> 00:12:05,137
Okay. But, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow.
I gave up an orthodontist.

162
00:12:05,242 --> 00:12:10,270
-Okay, I know I didn't Iove him....
-Oh, see, Jack did Iove the cow.

163
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:14,140
But, see, it was a pIan. It was cIear.

164
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:17,186
Everything was figured out.
Now it's Iike....

165
00:12:17,254 --> 00:12:19,245
-FIoopy?
-Yeah.

166
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:24,157
We don't know where we're going.

167
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:29,291
It's aII gonna come together
and it's just gonna be un-fIoopy.

168
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,164
Yeah, Iike that's a word.

169
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:39,172
Okay. But Monica, what if
it doesn't come together?

170
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,404
Pheebs?

171
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:46,372
WeII, because you just--
I don't Iike this question.

172
00:12:47,284 --> 00:12:51,186
See, you guys?
What if we don't get magic beans?

173
00:12:51,288 --> 00:12:56,191
I mean, what if aII
we've got are beans?

174
00:12:59,296 --> 00:13:02,322
Get him! Get him! Get him!

175
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:05,334
Yes! You're not Iaughing now,
are you, paI?

176
00:13:06,136 --> 00:13:10,129
AII you needed were guys
hitting each other with sticks.

177
00:13:10,174 --> 00:13:12,267
Pass it! Pass it!

178
00:13:12,342 --> 00:13:17,245
-He's open! He's open!
-Shoot it! Shoot it!

179
00:13:22,252 --> 00:13:25,153
Hey, Iook, we're on that TV thing.

180
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,292
Excuse me?

181
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:42,168
It says to caII if you're not
satisfied with this candy bar.

182
00:13:42,206 --> 00:13:45,266
WeII, I'm not compIeteIy satisfied.

183
00:13:47,211 --> 00:13:50,203
WeII, the IabeI
promises nutty goodness.

184
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:55,413
It's an emergency. But you know that,
or we'd be in the predicament room.

185
00:13:58,222 --> 00:14:01,214
HoId on. FiII these out.
Sit over there!

186
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:05,318
I don't want to make any troubIe
but I'm in a Iot of pain.

187
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:10,162
-My face is dented.
-WeII, you'II have to wait your turn.

188
00:14:10,234 --> 00:14:15,228
-How Iong do you think it wiII be?
-Any minute now.

189
00:14:17,341 --> 00:14:19,332
Hey, this--

190
00:14:31,355 --> 00:14:36,156
I'm so sorry, you guys.
I didn't mean to bring you down.

191
00:14:36,193 --> 00:14:41,290
No, you were right.
I don't have a pIan.

192
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:47,167
-Pizza guy.
-Food!

193
00:14:47,204 --> 00:14:49,263
-Phoebe?
-What?

194
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:53,367
-Do you have a pIan?
-I don't even have a ''pIa.''

195
00:14:56,213 --> 00:14:58,374
One mushroom, green pepper and onion?

196
00:14:59,183 --> 00:15:02,311
No, no, no.
That's not what we ordered!

197
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,419
We ordered a fat-free crust
with extra cheese!

198
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:14,127
Wait. You're not G. StephanopouIos?
Man, my dad's gonna kiII me!

199
00:15:14,231 --> 00:15:18,258
Wait! Did you say G. StephanopouIos?

200
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:23,329
Yeah, this one goes across the street.
I gave him yours. Bonehead! Bonehead!

201
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:27,338
When you do that,
you're onIy hitting yourseIf.

202
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:35,340
Was this a smaII Mediterranean guy
with curiousIy inteIIigent good Iooks?

203
00:15:35,385 --> 00:15:39,378
-That sounds right.
-Was he wearing a stunning bIue suit?

204
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,455
-And a power tie?
-No, pretty much just a toweI.

205
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:48,187
-Oh, God!
-You guys want me to take this back?

206
00:15:48,298 --> 00:15:53,201
What, are you nuts? We've got
George StephanopouIos' pizza!

207
00:15:56,406 --> 00:16:01,207
Pheebs, who's George SnuffIeupagus?

208
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:05,307
That's Big Bird's friend.

209
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:10,345
-I see pizza!
-I want to see. Let me see.

210
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:13,112
HeIIo! Who are we spying on?

211
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:16,215
White House adviser,
CIinton's campaign guy.

212
00:16:16,326 --> 00:16:20,126
The one with the great hair,
sexy smiIe, cute butt.

213
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,166
Oh, him! The IittIe guy.
Oh, I Iove him!

214
00:16:24,268 --> 00:16:29,433
-Wait. Wait, I see a woman.
-TeII me it's his mother.

215
00:16:30,173 --> 00:16:32,368
-DefiniteIy not his mother.
-Oh, no!

216
00:16:33,143 --> 00:16:37,341
Wait, she's waIking across the fIoor.
She's waIking, she's waIking....

217
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:41,340
She's going for the pizza--
That's not for you, bitch!

218
00:16:56,366 --> 00:17:01,235
We've been here for over an hour,
and peopIe Iess sick have gone in.

219
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:05,206
That guy with the toe thing,
who's he sIeeping with?

220
00:17:08,145 --> 00:17:11,114
Oh, come on, Dora. Don't be mad.

221
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:14,116
I know we both said some things...

222
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:19,316
...we didn't mean but that doesn't
mean we stiII don't Iove each other.

223
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:23,251
You know, I feeI Iike I've Iost her.

224
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,121
-Come on, push me.
-No.

225
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:31,360
-Push me.
-We're gonna get in troubIe.

226
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,228
Don't be a baby. Push me. Push me.

227
00:17:34,338 --> 00:17:40,140
AII right. I'm gonna push you, okay?
How about I push you Iike this?

228
00:17:41,378 --> 00:17:47,339
Now you're gonna be in a wheeIchair
the rest of your Iife, paIIy-waIIy....

229
00:17:49,286 --> 00:17:55,156
I am so very sorry. Can I sign you?

230
00:17:57,294 --> 00:17:59,262
-Lights stiII out?
-Yeah.

231
00:17:59,363 --> 00:18:02,230
WeII, maybe they're napping.

232
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:07,134
-PIease. They're having sex.
-Shut up!

233
00:18:10,107 --> 00:18:14,305
So, what do you think George is Iike?

234
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:17,142
-I think he's shy.
-Yeah.

235
00:18:17,214 --> 00:18:20,206
Yeah. I think you have
to draw him out.

236
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:25,244
And then when you do,
he's a preppy animaI.

237
00:18:26,256 --> 00:18:29,225
-What do you think of the guys?
-Our guys?

238
00:18:29,326 --> 00:18:33,126
-Yeah, our guys.
-I feeI funny taIking about that.

239
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,256
-Oh, come on.
-Okay. WeII....

240
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,234
I think Joey's Iike
a IittIe kiddie ride.

241
00:18:39,336 --> 00:18:43,432
You just have to put the quarter in
and it just goes.

242
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:49,235
He might surprise you. One time,
he heIped me put on my coat...

243
00:18:49,346 --> 00:18:52,247
...and he was reaIIy tender.

244
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:57,150
Come on, baby, come on. Let's go.

245
00:18:57,254 --> 00:18:59,188
Yes!

246
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:05,093
ChandIer's one of those repressed guys
who you'd have to seduce.

247
00:19:05,128 --> 00:19:10,088
I think it's an act. ChandIer is
more sophisticated than he seems.

248
00:19:15,205 --> 00:19:17,400
-You know who's kind of sexy?
-Don't.

249
00:19:18,141 --> 00:19:21,304
-Ross.
-No, guys. PIease, he is my brother.

250
00:19:21,344 --> 00:19:25,246
I know exactIy what you mean.
He can be reaIIy smooth.

251
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,260
Can't you just picture him in bed?

252
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:41,422
I reaIIy don't want to.

253
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:45,167
Come on, Iaugh. Laugh.

254
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:50,329
I remember the moonIight coming in the
window, and her face had the most...

255
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,271
...incredibIe gIow.

256
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:56,334
The moon, the gIow,
the magicaI feeIing. You did this.

257
00:19:57,147 --> 00:20:00,241
CouId I get some painkiIIers
over here, pIease?

258
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:04,286
He's right. Enough.
What's the big deaI about today?

259
00:20:04,354 --> 00:20:07,289
So you sIept with her
for the first time.

260
00:20:07,357 --> 00:20:10,383
You sIept with her
for seven years after that.

261
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,387
It's a IittIe more compIicated--

262
00:20:14,197 --> 00:20:18,395
What is it, that she Ieft you
for another woman that Iikes women?

263
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:24,300
Louder. There's a man on the 1 2th
fIoor in a coma who didn't hear you.

264
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:28,201
Then, what?

265
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,180
My first time with CaroI was...

266
00:20:32,215 --> 00:20:34,376
...was my....

267
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:36,409
What?

268
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:44,283
It was my first time.

269
00:20:44,427 --> 00:20:46,395
With CaroI?

270
00:20:51,301 --> 00:20:52,393
Oh.

271
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:57,204
So, in your whoIe Iife,
you've onIy been with one--?

272
00:20:58,408 --> 00:21:02,276
Oh, boy. Hockey was a big mistake.

273
00:21:03,146 --> 00:21:06,274
There's a bunch of stuff
we couId've done tonight.

274
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:10,244
Okay, I got one.

275
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:13,379
Do you remember
that vegetarian pâté...

276
00:21:14,157 --> 00:21:17,149
...that I made that you Ioved so much?

277
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:21,392
WeII, unIess goose is a vegetabIe--!

278
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:28,394
Now I don't feeI so bad
about sIeeping with Jason HurIey.

279
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:33,165
-What? You sIept with Jason?
-You had aIready broken up.

280
00:21:33,276 --> 00:21:35,369
-How Iong?
-Just a coupIe hours.

281
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:40,377
-Oh, that's nice!
-Okay, okay, okay, I got one!

282
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:47,379
Anyway, the vaIentine Tom Ieft in
your Iocker was reaIIy from me!

283
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,225
Excuse me?

284
00:21:50,293 --> 00:21:54,423
HeIIo! Like he was reaIIy
gonna send you one.

285
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:59,293
She was a big girI!

286
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:06,166
ReaIIy? WeII, at Ieast big girIs don't
pee in their pants in seventh grade!

287
00:22:06,276 --> 00:22:09,245
I was Iaughing. You made me Iaugh!

288
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,146
Oh, my God! There he is! There he is!

289
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:15,343
-Where?
-Where we've been Iooking aII night.

290
00:22:16,152 --> 00:22:19,144
-He's so cute.
-George, baby, drop the toweI.

291
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:23,352
-Come on, drop the toweI.
-Drop it. WiII you pIease drop it?

292
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,156
Wow!

293
00:22:28,398 --> 00:22:33,392
Man, can you beIieve
he's onIy had sex with one woman?

294
00:22:34,371 --> 00:22:38,364
I think it's great.
You know, it's sweet.

295
00:22:38,475 --> 00:22:40,466
It's romantic.

296
00:22:41,378 --> 00:22:42,402
ReaIIy?

297
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:46,273
You kidding? The guy's a freak.
I judge him.

298
00:22:46,316 --> 00:22:48,284
-Hey, man!
-Hey, buddy!

299
00:22:52,222 --> 00:22:56,215
Oh, that's attractive.

300
00:22:57,327 --> 00:23:01,127
I thought you were great
in <i>Silence of the Lambs.</i>

301
00:23:02,365 --> 00:23:06,233
Admit it, aII things considered,
you had fun tonight.

302
00:23:06,336 --> 00:23:10,170
Fun? Where was the fun?
TeII me which part was fun.

303
00:23:10,273 --> 00:23:11,365
Where's my puck?

304
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:15,134
-The kid has it.
-The kid--

305
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:18,341
Excuse me, that's my puck.

306
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:23,245
I found it.
Finders keepers, Iosers weepers.

307
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:27,453
You gotta do it, man.

308
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:31,393
I'm rubber, you're gIue.
Whatever you--

309
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:33,390
I can't do it.

310
00:23:34,197 --> 00:23:36,392
-Listen, give me back my puck.
-No.

311
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:38,361
-Yes, how about--?
-No.

312
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:40,369
-Give me my puck.
-No.

313
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:42,371
No roughhousing in my ER!

314
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:45,300
Give me my puck!

315
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,375
Now that was fun.

316
00:23:58,221 --> 00:24:02,317
Okay, Monica. Right foot, red.

317
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:06,318
We couId've pIayed MonopoIy, but no!

318
00:24:12,268 --> 00:24:14,168
Thanks.

319
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:24,177
Okay, Pheebs. Right hand, bIue.

320
00:24:31,187 --> 00:24:35,180
Ross, switch with me
and Phoebe couId be number two.

321
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:41,353
Nothing. It's a Twister thing.
The ruIes are on the back of the box.

322
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,394
