1
00:00:02,451 --> 00:00:04,442
Ross, she wants you.

2
00:00:05,253 --> 00:00:07,414
We just Iive in the same buiIding.

3
00:00:08,256 --> 00:00:10,349
-Any contact?
-She Ient me an egg.

4
00:00:10,425 --> 00:00:14,361
-You're in!
-Right.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,422
Hey, Ross.

6
00:00:22,437 --> 00:00:25,338
Come on. Get back in the game.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,343
The RacheI thing isn't happening,
your ex-wife's a Iesbian....

8
00:00:30,445 --> 00:00:32,436
I don't think we need a third.

9
00:00:33,248 --> 00:00:36,240
CouId we get an egg,
stiII in the sheII?

10
00:00:36,351 --> 00:00:37,340
An egg?

11
00:00:37,386 --> 00:00:42,346
Go up to her and say,
''I'm returning your egg.''

12
00:00:43,258 --> 00:00:45,351
I think it's winning.

13
00:00:45,394 --> 00:00:48,454
-It's insane.
-She'II Iove it.

14
00:00:49,297 --> 00:00:53,290
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Here.

15
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,262
Go with the egg, my friend.

16
00:00:59,374 --> 00:01:01,399
Go, go, go!

17
00:01:03,412 --> 00:01:06,438
-Think it'II work?
-No way. It's suicide.

18
00:01:07,416 --> 00:01:09,407
The One With The Candy Hearts

19
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,290
-You can't do this.
-Do what?

20
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:04,304
-Roger wants to take her out.
-No! Remember why you dumped him?

21
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,237
Because he was creepy.

22
00:02:07,342 --> 00:02:09,310
And mean. And frightening.

23
00:02:09,344 --> 00:02:14,213
StiII, it's nice to have
a date on VaIentine's Day!

24
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:17,249
You can go out with a creep any night.

25
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,414
I know I do.

26
00:02:22,424 --> 00:02:27,452
-What are you doing tomorrow night?
-That depends on how tonight goes.

27
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:31,256
-About tonight--
-Don't you baiI on me!

28
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:35,235
I said I'd bring a friend
for her friend.

29
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,331
-But her friend sounds Iike a--
-Pathetic mess. I know, but....

30
00:02:40,242 --> 00:02:42,437
Come on. She's needy, vuInerabIe.

31
00:02:42,477 --> 00:02:45,446
I'm thinking....

32
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:51,285
Thanks.

33
00:02:51,353 --> 00:02:55,449
You haven't been out with a woman
since Janice. You're doing this.

34
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,387
-She said yes.
-Way to go, man!

35
00:03:03,231 --> 00:03:05,324
StiII got the egg, huh?

36
00:03:18,413 --> 00:03:20,404
How do I Iook?

37
00:03:21,249 --> 00:03:23,410
I don't care.

38
00:03:26,421 --> 00:03:28,412
There's Lorraine.

39
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:32,256
No trading. You get the pretty one,
I get the mess.

40
00:03:32,427 --> 00:03:34,418
Hi, Joey.

41
00:03:37,265 --> 00:03:40,325
WeII, weII!
Look what you brought!

42
00:03:40,468 --> 00:03:43,232
Very nice.

43
00:03:43,338 --> 00:03:46,364
And what did you bring?

44
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,441
She's checking her coat.

45
00:03:49,244 --> 00:03:52,338
I'm gonna wash the cab smeII
off of my hands.

46
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,476
Get me a white zinfandeI,
and a gIass of red for Janice.

47
00:04:01,223 --> 00:04:03,282
Janice?

48
00:04:04,226 --> 00:04:06,285
Janice!?

49
00:04:06,428 --> 00:04:08,191
Oh...

50
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,390
...my...

51
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:11,331
...God!

52
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:17,433
Hey, it's Janice!

53
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:25,438
Okay, I'm making a break for it!

54
00:04:26,214 --> 00:04:30,412
I've been waiting for, Iike, forever
to go out with Lorraine.

55
00:04:31,219 --> 00:04:33,244
-Just caIm down.
-CaIm down?

56
00:04:33,321 --> 00:04:37,451
You set me up with a woman I've
dumped twice in the Iast five months!

57
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,521
Can you stop yeIIing?
You're making me nervous and....

58
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:48,234
I can't go when I'm nervous.

59
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:50,463
I'm sorry, you're right.

60
00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:57,334
Come on! Do it, do it!

61
00:04:59,347 --> 00:05:03,181
Roger was creepy, but he was nothing
compared to Pete.

62
00:05:03,285 --> 00:05:05,219
-Who?
-Pete the Weeper.

63
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,279
The guy that used to cry
every time we had sex?

64
00:05:09,324 --> 00:05:13,226
''Was it good for you?''

65
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:18,290
I'd take crying any day
over Howard, the ''I win'' guy!

66
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,392
''I win! I win!''

67
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:26,196
We went out for two months.
I didn't win once.

68
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:29,404
How do we end up with these jerks?

69
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:32,413
We're some kind of magnets.

70
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:36,440
I know I am. That's why I can't
wear a digitaI watch.

71
00:05:39,354 --> 00:05:42,221
There's more beer, right?

72
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:47,260
You know my friend who shaves her head?

73
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:48,418
No.

74
00:05:48,463 --> 00:05:52,229
I have this friend
who shaves her head.

75
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:55,269
She says to break the
bad boyfriend cycIe...

76
00:05:55,337 --> 00:05:58,363
...you can do a cIeansing rituaI.

77
00:06:00,275 --> 00:06:04,371
Pheebs, this woman
is voIuntariIy baId.

78
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,406
Yeah.

79
00:06:07,282 --> 00:06:09,409
We can do it tomorrow night.

80
00:06:10,218 --> 00:06:12,277
It's VaIentine's Day.
It's perfect.

81
00:06:12,387 --> 00:06:14,412
Okay, what kind of rituaI?

82
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,320
We can burn the stuff they gave us.

83
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:21,287
Or...?

84
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:27,392
Or we can chant and dance
around naked with sticks.

85
00:06:29,437 --> 00:06:32,406
Burning's good.

86
00:06:41,316 --> 00:06:42,442
You know...

87
00:06:43,218 --> 00:06:47,348
...I can pick up quarters with my toes.

88
00:06:47,455 --> 00:06:51,357
Yeah?
Good for you.

89
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:56,354
Quarters or roIIs of quarters?

90
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:05,405
By the way, I cut you out of
aII of my pictures.

91
00:07:06,174 --> 00:07:10,474
So if you want, I have a bag
with just your heads.

92
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:12,406
That's okay.

93
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:16,478
You couId make IittIe puppets
out of them.

94
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:21,382
And you couId use them in your
Theater of CrueIty!

95
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:28,227
-We can't do that!
-What? What can't you do?

96
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:35,200
Can I taIk to you for a second?
Over there?

97
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:43,437
We might be Ieaving now.

98
00:07:44,212 --> 00:07:47,204
TeII me it's you and me ''we.''

99
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:51,241
She wants to sIather my body
with stuff and Iick it off.

100
00:07:51,352 --> 00:07:54,344
I'm not even sure what sIathering is!

101
00:07:54,422 --> 00:07:58,256
But I definiteIy want
to be a part of it!

102
00:07:58,426 --> 00:08:02,260
Okay, you cannot do this to me.

103
00:08:02,397 --> 00:08:05,161
You're right. I'm sorry.

104
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:09,464
Can we have three
chocoIate mousses to go?

105
00:08:10,271 --> 00:08:12,398
I'm out of here.

106
00:08:13,374 --> 00:08:17,208
Here's my credit card.
Dinner's on me.

107
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:20,213
I hope she throws up on you.

108
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:24,174
Thanks.

109
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,289
-So....
-Just us.

110
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:31,187
What a crappy night!

111
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:33,419
I have enjoyed the fact...

112
00:08:34,195 --> 00:08:38,291
...that your shirt's been
sticking out of your zipper.

113
00:08:43,404 --> 00:08:46,237
Excuse me.

114
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:51,301
How you doing?

115
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:58,350
So do we have the best friends,
or what?

116
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:02,355
Joey's not a friend.
He's...

117
00:09:03,157 --> 00:09:07,253
...a stupid man who Ieft us
his credit card.

118
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:11,264
Another drink? Dessert?
A big-screen TV?

119
00:09:11,366 --> 00:09:14,358
-I'II have a drink.
-Got it. Good woman!

120
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:23,469
-A bottIe of overpriced champagne.
-Each.

121
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:27,477
That's right, each.
And a rob roy.

122
00:09:28,216 --> 00:09:30,184
I've aIways wanted to know.

123
00:09:48,202 --> 00:09:53,333
Happy VaIentine's Day!

124
00:09:59,414 --> 00:10:03,407
Oh, I miss you aIready.

125
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:06,443
-Can you beIieve this happened?
-No, no!

126
00:10:08,423 --> 00:10:10,516
And yet it did.

127
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:14,251
-Goodbye, Janice.
-IKiss me!

128
00:10:16,264 --> 00:10:18,323
Oh, ChandIer. Sorry.

129
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:21,527
Oh, ChandIer. Sorry!

130
00:10:23,271 --> 00:10:25,330
-Hey, Janice.
-Hi, Monica.

131
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,433
WeII, this was very speciaI.

132
00:10:29,477 --> 00:10:32,537
Rach, come see who's out here!

133
00:10:33,281 --> 00:10:36,250
What's going on? Oh, my God!

134
00:10:36,351 --> 00:10:38,444
Janice! Hi!

135
00:10:38,553 --> 00:10:42,489
Janice is gonna go away now!

136
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,393
I'II be right back.

137
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:49,486
Joey! Look who it is!

138
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:54,393
Good. Joey's home.

139
00:10:54,469 --> 00:10:57,302
This is so much fun!

140
00:10:57,372 --> 00:11:01,240
This is Iike a reunion in the haII!

141
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:06,336
Ross, there's someone
I want you to say hi to.

142
00:11:07,515 --> 00:11:09,312
He happened to caII.

143
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:14,310
Hi, Ross. That's right, it's me!
How did you know?

144
00:11:29,437 --> 00:11:33,339
So, if dogs experience jet Iag...

145
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:37,468
...because of the seven dog years
to one human year thing...

146
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:41,339
...when a dog fIies
from New York to Los AngeIes...

147
00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:46,443
...he doesn't just Iose three hours,
he Ioses a week and a haIf.

148
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,282
That's funny!

149
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,233
They shouId be cooking the food soon.

150
00:12:02,336 --> 00:12:03,496
Oh, good.

151
00:12:14,215 --> 00:12:15,307
Who are they?

152
00:12:15,349 --> 00:12:21,219
The bIond is my ex-wife.
The woman touching her is her...

153
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:24,348
...cIose, personaI friend.

154
00:12:26,227 --> 00:12:31,221
-They're Iovers?
-If you want to put a IabeI on it.

155
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:37,269
-Anything eIse I shouId know?
-Nope. That's it.

156
00:12:37,472 --> 00:12:41,431
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby.

157
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:48,271
I aIways forget that part.

158
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:50,476
HeIIo!

159
00:12:56,257 --> 00:13:02,196
Now we need sage branches
and the sacramentaI wine.

160
00:13:03,197 --> 00:13:06,223
AII I had is oregano and a Fresca.

161
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,393
That's okay!

162
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:17,300
Now we need the semen
of a righteous man.

163
00:13:22,216 --> 00:13:27,347
If we had that, we wouIdn't be doing
the rituaI in the first pIace.

164
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:32,256
-Can we start throwing things in?
-Yeah, okay!

165
00:13:35,229 --> 00:13:37,424
Okay.
Barry's Ietters.

166
00:13:37,532 --> 00:13:40,365
Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.

167
00:13:40,434 --> 00:13:46,236
And I have the receipt
from my dinner with....

168
00:13:48,476 --> 00:13:52,344
-A picture of Scotty Jared naked!
-Let me see!

169
00:13:52,446 --> 00:13:56,246
-He's wearing a sweater.
-No.

170
00:14:00,421 --> 00:14:03,390
-Whose MCI card is that?
-Mine. Shoot!

171
00:14:04,192 --> 00:14:08,390
Remember this number:
Nine, seven, four....

172
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:13,429
Okay, and here we have
the Iast of PaoIo's grappa.

173
00:14:14,202 --> 00:14:16,397
Wait, isn't it aImost pure--

174
00:14:20,508 --> 00:14:24,410
How can I dump this woman
on VaIentine's Day?

175
00:14:24,512 --> 00:14:28,346
I don't know.
You dumped her on New Year's.

176
00:14:29,217 --> 00:14:33,313
In my next Iife,
I'm coming back as a toiIet brush.

177
00:14:34,455 --> 00:14:38,255
HeIIo, funny vaIentine!

178
00:14:38,326 --> 00:14:40,453
Hi, just Janice.

179
00:14:41,262 --> 00:14:44,231
HeIIo, Joey, our IittIe matchmaker.

180
00:14:44,265 --> 00:14:47,359
I couId just kiss you aII over,
and I'm gonna.

181
00:14:52,373 --> 00:14:56,332
If you don't do it, I wiII.

182
00:15:15,196 --> 00:15:20,327
-So are you actuaIIy from New York?
-Not originaIIy. I'm from--

183
00:15:20,434 --> 00:15:24,427
-You said they'd shoot it without you.
-I thought they couId.

184
00:15:25,206 --> 00:15:31,202
The maxi-pads were a piece of cake.
Mini-pads shouId be that much easier.

185
00:15:31,245 --> 00:15:35,238
-It's VaIentine's Day.
-I know, but it's my job.

186
00:15:35,316 --> 00:15:38,342
I'II try to get back
as soon as I can.

187
00:15:38,452 --> 00:15:41,444
I'm spending most of my time
teaching science...

188
00:15:42,223 --> 00:15:46,455
...which is funny because
that wasn't even my major.

189
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:01,174
Now, that is funny!

190
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:08,307
Do you think it wouId be too weird
if I invited CaroI over to join us?

191
00:16:08,382 --> 00:16:14,287
Because she's aIone now.
And pregnant. And sad.

192
00:16:14,322 --> 00:16:18,281
-I guess.
-Are you sure? CaroI!

193
00:16:18,392 --> 00:16:21,327
-Wanna join us?
-No, I'm fine.

194
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:24,489
Come on.
These peopIe wiII scooch down.

195
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:31,331
You guys wiII scooch, won't you?
Let's try scooching! Come on!

196
00:16:31,405 --> 00:16:34,431
-Come on.
-Thank you.

197
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:40,237
IKristen Riggs, this is CaroI WiIIick.
CaroI, IKristen.

198
00:16:40,348 --> 00:16:44,250
-How do you do?
-CaroI teaches sixth grade.

199
00:16:44,418 --> 00:16:47,251
And IKristen....

200
00:16:50,324 --> 00:16:53,418
IKristen does something...

201
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:57,321
...that, funniIy enough...

202
00:16:57,431 --> 00:17:01,197
...wasn't even her major!

203
00:17:03,204 --> 00:17:07,368
-Thanks for coming over.
-Not at aII. It's pretty much our job.

204
00:17:07,408 --> 00:17:10,377
That's why we get the cooI hats.

205
00:17:10,411 --> 00:17:15,246
-What do we got there?
-A piece of siIk boxer shorts.

206
00:17:15,316 --> 00:17:17,409
Some greeting cards.

207
00:17:18,386 --> 00:17:21,253
A haIf-charred picture of....

208
00:17:21,322 --> 00:17:24,382
That guy's hairier than the chief!

209
00:17:27,395 --> 00:17:31,297
It's a reaIIy funny story
how this happened.

210
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:37,201
I was taking out the trash,
and Phoebe was burning incense--

211
00:17:37,238 --> 00:17:38,330
It's aII right.

212
00:17:38,406 --> 00:17:43,434
This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire
we've seen get out of controI.

213
00:17:44,345 --> 00:17:46,438
-Third one tonight.
-ReaIIy?

214
00:17:47,214 --> 00:17:51,241
VaIentine's is our
busiest night of the year.

215
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:56,415
Next time you're burning
your ex-boyfriend's stuff:

216
00:17:56,457 --> 00:17:59,426
One, do it in a weII-ventiIated area.

217
00:17:59,527 --> 00:18:05,159
Two, if you wanna burn his cIothing,
stay away from synthetic fabrics.

218
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:10,398
Three, try to Iet go of the anger,
and Iearn to Iove yourseIf.

219
00:18:13,174 --> 00:18:16,405
-I brought you something.
-Is it Ioaded?

220
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:26,277
Oh, IittIe candy hearts.
''Chan and Jan Forever.''

221
00:18:27,188 --> 00:18:29,383
I had them made speciaI.

222
00:18:32,426 --> 00:18:35,395
Okay, Janice.

223
00:18:37,431 --> 00:18:40,332
Hey, Janice.

224
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,396
There's no way to teII you this.

225
00:18:44,438 --> 00:18:47,305
At Ieast, there's no new way.

226
00:18:50,311 --> 00:18:54,338
I just don't think things
are gonna work out.

227
00:18:55,516 --> 00:18:59,350
That's fine.

228
00:19:01,155 --> 00:19:02,383
It is?

229
00:19:03,157 --> 00:19:07,457
Because I know that this
isn't the end.

230
00:19:08,362 --> 00:19:11,160
You see, actuaIIy, it is.

231
00:19:11,198 --> 00:19:14,167
No, because you won't Iet that happen.

232
00:19:14,268 --> 00:19:16,168
Don't you know it yet?

233
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:20,366
You Iove me, ChandIer Bing!

234
00:19:23,277 --> 00:19:25,302
Oh, no, I don't.

235
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:30,373
Why do we keep ending up together?
New Year's, who invited who?

236
00:19:30,484 --> 00:19:34,420
-VaIentine's, who asked who into bed?
-I did, but--

237
00:19:35,222 --> 00:19:36,382
You seek me out!

238
00:19:36,423 --> 00:19:41,417
Something deep in your souI
caIIs out to me Iike a foghorn!

239
00:19:42,229 --> 00:19:45,426
Janice! Janice!

240
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:50,226
You push me away,
you puII me back!

241
00:19:50,404 --> 00:19:53,237
You want me. You need me.

242
00:19:53,307 --> 00:19:58,301
You can't Iive without me.
And you know it.

243
00:19:58,412 --> 00:20:04,248
You just don't know you know it.

244
00:20:07,254 --> 00:20:09,313
See?

245
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:17,424
CaII me!

246
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:28,531
It's not true.
I never caIIed your mother a woIverine.

247
00:20:29,276 --> 00:20:32,370
You did so, I swear to--

248
00:20:35,382 --> 00:20:38,442
How Iong has she been in the bathroom?

249
00:20:38,552 --> 00:20:42,283
She isn't in the bathroom.
Her coat's gone.

250
00:20:42,356 --> 00:20:46,258
WeII, maybe it's coId in there.

251
00:20:46,493 --> 00:20:50,259
I screwed up my first date
in nine years.

252
00:20:50,297 --> 00:20:53,494
-That couId be it.
-Oh, God.

253
00:20:54,268 --> 00:20:57,567
You know, this is stiII pretty hot.

254
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,301
Mushroom.

255
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,401
SmiIe.

256
00:21:05,512 --> 00:21:10,313
They won't aII be Iike this.
Some might stay through dinner.

257
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:13,443
-I'm sorry. That's not funny.
-It's just....

258
00:21:14,221 --> 00:21:17,418
You know the whoIe
''get on with your Iife'' thing?

259
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,256
WeII, do I have to?

260
00:21:20,327 --> 00:21:25,264
I'm sitting here
with this cute woman...

261
00:21:25,332 --> 00:21:28,358
...and she's perfectIy nice, but that...

262
00:21:30,471 --> 00:21:32,462
...that's it.

263
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,234
Then I'm here taIking to you,
and it's easy and it's fun.

264
00:21:38,345 --> 00:21:40,438
And I don't have to....

265
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,375
-I know.
-You know?

266
00:21:46,487 --> 00:21:49,479
Here's a wacky thought.

267
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:53,488
Let's say you and I give it
another shot.

268
00:21:54,261 --> 00:21:57,389
I know what you're gonna say.
You're a Iesbian.

269
00:21:58,465 --> 00:22:03,300
But what do you say we just
put that aside for now.

270
00:22:03,404 --> 00:22:06,305
Let's just stick a pin in it.

271
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:12,301
Because we're great together.
You can't deny it.

272
00:22:12,446 --> 00:22:16,405
I've got a ring at home
that fits you.

273
00:22:16,517 --> 00:22:21,420
I've got Iots of pictures
with both of us in them.

274
00:22:22,222 --> 00:22:26,249
And best of aII,
you're carrying my baby.

275
00:22:26,327 --> 00:22:29,228
-I mean, how perfect is that?
-Ross--

276
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:34,461
You keep saying that, but there's
something right here. I Iove you.

277
00:22:41,442 --> 00:22:44,434
I Iove you too.

278
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:47,372
-But--
-No ''but.''

279
00:22:48,449 --> 00:22:53,443
You know that thing we
put over here with the pin in it?

280
00:22:55,255 --> 00:22:59,351
It's time to take the pin out.

281
00:23:04,198 --> 00:23:07,429
You'II find someone.
The right woman is waiting for you.

282
00:23:08,235 --> 00:23:12,399
It's easy for you to say.
You found one aIready.

283
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:17,333
AII you need is a woman who Iikes men,
and you'II be set.

284
00:23:20,414 --> 00:23:23,349
Not her.

285
00:23:34,361 --> 00:23:38,354
So, you guys reaIIy sIide down a poIe?

286
00:23:41,235 --> 00:23:45,228
-AbsoIuteIy.
-That's so cooI.

287
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:48,272
How do you get back up?

288
00:23:50,277 --> 00:23:54,475
WeII, we rareIy have to return
from a fire as quickIy.

289
00:23:57,484 --> 00:24:00,282
So, wouId you guys....

290
00:24:00,387 --> 00:24:05,324
WouId you Iike to, sometime, maybe....

291
00:24:05,392 --> 00:24:07,383
Go for a drink sometime?

292
00:24:07,428 --> 00:24:09,225
Sure, sounds good.

293
00:24:09,296 --> 00:24:12,390
We get off at midnight.
We'II pick you up then.

294
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,394
Okay. Great!

295
00:24:15,402 --> 00:24:19,304
So wiII you bring the truck?

296
00:24:20,407 --> 00:24:23,308
I'II even Iet you ring the beII.

297
00:24:23,343 --> 00:24:27,302
-We'II see you Iater.
-Bye! See you Iater!

298
00:24:28,348 --> 00:24:29,406
Oh, my God!

299
00:24:31,218 --> 00:24:33,413
See? There you go.
The cIeansing worked.

300
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,512
You're right. They're nice guys!

301
00:24:37,257 --> 00:24:41,216
They're firemen guys!

302
00:24:41,261 --> 00:24:45,357
-TeII them you're married?
-No. My girIfriend doesn't even know.
