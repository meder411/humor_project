1
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:04,328
Let it go. It's not a big deaI.

2
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:09,374
Not a big deaI? It's amazing. You
reach in, there's one maneuver and bam!

3
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,535
A bra. Right out the sIeeve.

4
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:17,282
As far as I know, guys don't do
anything that comes cIose. Right?

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,342
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.

6
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:23,286
We can? Okay, I'm trying that.

7
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,288
IKnow what bIows my mind?

8
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:29,453
Women can see breasts
anytime they want.

9
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:34,262
You Iook down,
and there they are.

10
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,302
How you get any work done
is beyond me.

11
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,499
I don't get how guys can do
so many mean things...

12
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:44,368
...and not even care.

13
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:53,376
-MuItipIe orgasms!
-There you go.

14
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:59,484
The One With the
East German Laundry Detergent

15
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,274
Saturday night. The big night!

16
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:52,267
Date night!
Saturday night. Saturday night!

17
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,472
-No pIans, huh?
-Not a one!

18
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,474
Not even breaking up with Janice?

19
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:02,248
Right, right. Shut up.

20
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,225
ChandIer, nobody Iikes
breaking up with someone.

21
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:10,262
Except for IKevin MiIImore,
may he rot in heII.

22
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:14,265
-You just gotta do it.
-I know. But it's just so hard.

23
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:17,326
You're sitting there with her.
She has no idea.

24
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,237
You finaIIy get up
the courage to do it.

25
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,470
There's that awkward moment
when you've handed her the note.

26
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:31,349
You try to run out of the restaurant
before she's finished the note.

27
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:37,445
Why do you have to break up with her?
Be a man. Just stop caIIing.

28
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,283
If you want, I'II do it with you.

29
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:45,262
She'd feeI Iike
we're ganging up on her.

30
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,493
You dump Janice,
I'II dump Tony.

31
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:52,465
-You're breaking up with Tony?
-He's sweet, but it's not fun anymore.

32
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:57,306
I don't know if it's me or
his hunger strike, I don't know.

33
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,243
Do you want anything eIse?

34
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:04,409
You had a nutty, chocoIate-y,
kind of cake-y, pie thing that--

35
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,221
Nothing. I'm fine.

36
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,449
What's wrong? Why so scrunchie?

37
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:17,218
My father wants to give me
a Mercedes convertibIe.

38
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,356
That guy, he burns me up.

39
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,459
Yeah, it's a Mercedes
if I move back home.

40
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,239
It was horribIe!
He caIIed me ''young Iady.''

41
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,275
I hate when my father
caIIs me that.

42
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:34,242
Did he say
''You're not up to this'' again?

43
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:37,282
I got the extended version
with choruses of...

44
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,444
...''You'II Never Make it on Your Own.''

45
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,483
Hi, Joey.

46
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,352
Oh, my God! AngeIa!

47
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,454
Wow! Being dumped
by you agrees with her.

48
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:56,501
-Are you gonna go over there?
-No. Yeah. No.

49
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,396
Okay, but not yet.
I don't wanna seem too eager.

50
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:06,210
One Mississippi, two Mississippi...

51
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:09,406
...three Mississippi.
That seems pretty cooI.

52
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,251
-Hey, AngeIa.
-Joey.

53
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,413
You Iook good.

54
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:21,353
That's because I'm wearing a dress
that accents my boobs.

55
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,231
You don't say.

56
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,371
So, RacheI, what are you
doing tonight?

57
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,466
Big gIamour night.
Me and Monica at Launderama.

58
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:44,280
You wanna hear a freakish coincidence?
Guess who's doing Iaundry there too?

59
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,475
-Who?
-Me!

60
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,244
Was that not cIear?

61
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:53,450
Why don't...?

62
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:57,259
Why don't I just
join you both there?

63
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,289
Don't you have a Iaundry room
in your buiIding?

64
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,292
Yes.

65
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:07,203
I do have a Iaundry room
in my buiIding.

66
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,433
But there's a rat probIem.

67
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,405
ApparentIy, they're attracted
to dryer sheets.

68
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:19,407
They're going in fine,
but they're coming out aII fIuffy.

69
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:25,222
-Anyway, 7-ish?
-Sure.

70
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:32,527
-Forget it. I'm with Bob now.
-Bob? Who the heII's Bob?

71
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:37,464
Bob is great. He's smart,
sophisticated, and he has a reaI job.

72
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,536
You go on three auditions a month
and you're an actor. Bob--

73
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:45,335
Come on! We were great together.

74
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:50,338
And not just at the fun stuff,
but, Iike, taIking too.

75
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:57,449
Sorry, Joey. You said,
''Let's be friends.'' So guess what?

76
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,225
-What?
-We're just friends.

77
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,190
Fine. Fine.

78
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:06,197
Why don't the four of us have
dinner tonight? As friends.

79
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,391
What ''four of us''?

80
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:12,200
You and Bob,
and me and my girIfriend...

81
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,238
...Monica.

82
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,241
I'm teIIing you,
this guy's perfect for you.

83
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:21,302
Forget it! Not after your cousin
who couId beIch the aIphabet.

84
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:25,513
Come on, this guy's great.
His name's Bob. He's AngeIa's...

85
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,413
...brother. He's smart,
he's sophisticated...

86
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:31,422
...and he has a reaI job.

87
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:35,517
I go on three auditions a month
and say I'm an actor, but he's--

88
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,422
-God heIp us.
-What?

89
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,364
UgIy Naked Guy
is Iaying kitchen tiIe.

90
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,431
Look, I'm asking a favor here.

91
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:51,375
If I do this for her brother,
maybe AngeIa wiII come back to me.

92
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:54,538
What's going on?
You go out with tons of girIs.

93
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:58,273
I know, but AngeIa's different.

94
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:03,481
She's Iike one of a kind,
Iike a snowfIake or....

95
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:09,191
-Something eIse Iike a snowfIake?
-Yeah, yeah.

96
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:13,493
Look, I made a huge mistake.
I never shouId've broke up with her.

97
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,292
WiII you heIp me? PIease?

98
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:28,304
HoId on a sec.
You need to not touch any of those.

99
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,341
Okay, bye.

100
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:35,253
Monica's not coming.
It's just gonna be me and RacheI.

101
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:40,248
HoId on, camper.
You've thought this through?

102
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:44,227
It's Iaundry.
The thinking-through is minimaI.

103
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,455
Just you and RacheI?
Just you two?

104
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:50,429
This is a date.
You're going on a date.

105
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:56,365
-Uh-uh.
-Uh-huh.

106
00:07:57,243 --> 00:08:02,180
-I haven't done that in a whiIe.
-Is it a date if she doesn't know?

107
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:07,184
Yes, absoIuteIy.
Saturday night, aII ruIes appIy.

108
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:11,222
What are you saying? I shouId
shave again? Pick up some wine?

109
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,192
WeII, you may wanna rethink
the dirty underwear.

110
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:20,393
It's the first time she'II see
your underwear. You want it dirty?

111
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,328
No.

112
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,297
And the fabric softener?

113
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:33,401
Okay, now what is wrong
with my SnuggIes?

114
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:37,341
What? It says I'm a sensitive,
warm kind of guy.

115
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,442
You know, Iike a IittIe fuzzy bear.

116
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,415
-I'II pick something eIse up.
-There you go.

117
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,417
Thank you.

118
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:54,229
What does Bob Iook Iike?
Is he taII, short?

119
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,424
Yep.

120
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:59,463
-Which?
-Which what?

121
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:04,368
-You've never met Bob, have you?
-No, but--

122
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:09,210
-For aII we know, he's horribIy--
-Hey, Joey!

123
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:13,309
HorribIy attractive.
I'II be shutting up now.

124
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,188
Where are they? Where are they?

125
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,490
This is nice. We never
do anything, just the two of us.

126
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,394
Great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent
a car, run over some puppies.

127
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:31,301
I don't wanna do that.

128
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,338
-Here we go.
-Have a good breakup.

129
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,212
-Hey, Janice.
-My God, I am so gIad you caIIed me.

130
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:45,240
I had the most supremeIy awfuI day.

131
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,216
That's not good.

132
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,346
Can I get an espresso
and a Iatte over here?

133
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:55,451
We got the proofs from the shoot
with the vegetabIes. They sucked.

134
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,254
I bIew off the afternoon.
I went shopping.

135
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,267
And I got you....

136
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,337
I'm Iooking. I'm Iooking.

137
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,371
I'm Iooking.

138
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,238
-I got you--
-What?

139
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:13,540
-What?
-What did you get me there?

140
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,440
I got you...

141
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,274
...these.

142
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,343
BuIIwinkIe socks.

143
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,254
-That's sweet.
-I knew you had Rockys.

144
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:29,455
You can wear BuIIwinkIe and BuIIwinkIe
or Rocky and Rocky, or you can mix.

145
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:34,364
Moose and squirreI.
Whatever you want.

146
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:42,270
I'm gonna get another espresso.
More Iatte?

147
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,570
No, I'm stiII working on mine.

148
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,284
-That's it?
-Yeah, it was reaIIy hard.

149
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,323
-Yeah, the hug Iooked pretty brutaI.
-You weren't there.

150
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,229
-Sorry.
-How are things going?

151
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:08,324
Going? Things are not going.
She got me socks.

152
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:13,462
These go with your Rockys. She reaIIy
cares about you-- I'm sorry.

153
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,477
Coming through. Move. Move!

154
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,488
Excuse me! I was kind of
using that machine.

155
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,357
Yeah, weII, now you're kind of not.

156
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,402
But I saved it.
I put my basket on top.

157
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:47,370
I'm sorry.
Is that your basket?

158
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:51,570
It's pretty.
UnfortunateIy, I don't see suds!

159
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,268
What?

160
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:58,374
No suds, no save, okay?

161
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,412
What's going on?

162
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:06,423
Nothing. This horribIe woman
just took my machine.

163
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,318
Was your basket on top?

164
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:10,452
-Yeah, but there were no suds.
-So?

165
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:14,460
-You know, no suds, no save.
-No suds, no-- Excuse me.

166
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:19,226
HoId on a second!
This is my friend's machine.

167
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,363
Hey, hey, hey!
Her stuff wasn't in it!

168
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:25,433
Hey, hey, hey! That's not
the ruIe, and you know it!

169
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:37,481
AII right. Show's over.

170
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,357
Nothing to see here.

171
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,388
Okay. Let's do Iaundry.

172
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,459
That was amazing!
I can't even send back soup.

173
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:57,306
WeII, that's because you're
such a sweet, gentIe....

174
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:02,413
Do you--? Do you--?
Oh, hey. You must need detergent.

175
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,219
-What's that?
-Überweiss.

176
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:12,415
It's new. It's German.
It's extra tough!

177
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:18,260
Rach, are you gonna separate those?

178
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:23,233
Oh, God.
Am I being a totaI Iaundry spaz?

179
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:28,363
Am I supposed to use one machine
for shirts and another for pants?

180
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,468
Have you never done this before?

181
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:38,342
WeII, not myseIf.
But I know other peopIe that have.

182
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,448
Okay. You caught me.
I'm a Iaundry virgin.

183
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:48,290
Don't worry.
I'II use the gentIe cycIe.

184
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:56,266
BasicaIIy, you wanna use
one machine for aII your whites.

185
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,495
A whoIe other machine
for your coIors.

186
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:03,332
And a third for your...

187
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:06,242
...deIicates.
That wouId be your bras...

188
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:10,213
...and your underpanty things.

189
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:15,243
These are white cotton panties.

190
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:18,313
WouId they go with whites
or with deIicates?

191
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,258
That wouId be a judgment caII.

192
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,432
He's so cute!

193
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,233
Where did you grow up?

194
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,531
-BrookIyn Heights.
-CIeveIand.

195
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:36,536
-How'd that happen?
-My God!

196
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,435
What?

197
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:43,441
I suddenIy had the feeIing
I was faIIing.

198
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,441
But I'm not.

199
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,385
So, you and AngeIa, huh?

200
00:14:56,462 --> 00:15:00,398
-Yep. Pretty much.
-You're a Iucky man.

201
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,493
IKnow what I miss most about her?

202
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:08,195
That cute nibbIy noise
she makes when she eats.

203
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:11,208
Like a happy IittIe squirreI...

204
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,244
...or a weaseI.

205
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:18,305
-I never reaIIy noticed.
-Oh, yeah, yeah. Listen for it.

206
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,252
Monica. Monica is great.

207
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,412
Yeah, she is.

208
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:27,420
But it's not gonna Iast.

209
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:31,225
She's too much for me in bed.

210
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,331
SexuaIIy.

211
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,463
I've gotta teII you, Bob is terrific.

212
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,364
Yeah, isn't he?

213
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:46,344
It's great to meet a smart, funny guy
who's emotionaIIy oIder than 8.

214
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:51,338
You know what eIse?
He's unbeIievabIe in bed!

215
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:58,382
My brother never even toId me
when he Iost his virginity.

216
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,385
That's nice.

217
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:09,433
You can. It's Iike
puIIing off a Band-Aid.

218
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:14,194
Just do it reaIIy fast,
and then the wound is exposed.

219
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,297
Go! Go!

220
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,445
Hi, Janice.

221
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:35,259
Here we go. I don't think
we shouId go out anymore.

222
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,325
AII right.

223
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,431
WeII, there you go.

224
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:54,269
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

225
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,474
This isn't about you.

226
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,309
I know! It's about
your fear of commitment.

227
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,287
I'm not afraid.

228
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,186
-PIease.
-I don't!

229
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:09,251
-I don't! I'm ready to commit anytime.
-ReaIIy?

230
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,288
I know this is gonna sound stupid...

231
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:15,231
...but I feeI that if I can do this...

232
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,394
...if I can actuaIIy do
my own Iaundry...

233
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,399
...there isn't anything I can't do.

234
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,267
That does not sound stupid to me.

235
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:29,405
The first time I had to cook
for myseIf after CaroI Ieft me--

236
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:34,248
I'm sorry, that's aII the time
we have. Next on Ross....

237
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:36,446
-Uh-oh.
-What?

238
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,246
Uh-oh....

239
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:41,417
Uh-oh, the Iaundry's done.

240
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,361
It's a song.

241
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,364
The Iaundry song we sing.

242
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:51,233
<i>Uh-oh! The laundry's done</i>

243
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,268
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

244
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,431
<i>The laundry's done</i>

245
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,230
Come on, show me.

246
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:03,178
It's just that you Ieft a red sock
with your whites, and now...

247
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:07,185
...everything's kind of pink.

248
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,217
Everything's pink?

249
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,223
Except for the red sock,
which is stiII red.

250
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,226
Don't be upset.
It can happen to anyone.

251
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,285
But it happened to me.

252
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:21,197
God, I'm gonna Iook Iike
a big MarshmaIIow Peep!

253
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,200
What am I doing?

254
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:26,328
My father's right!
I can't Iive on my own.

255
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,407
I can't even do Iaundry!

256
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:46,220
Something went wrong with Underdog
and they couIdn't infIate his head.

257
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,326
So anyway...

258
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:53,230
...his head is fIopping
down Broadway, right?

259
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:58,328
And I'm thinking
how inappropriate this is.

260
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:03,170
Something's in my eye. CouId we
check it in the Iight, pIease?

261
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,274
-Oh, my God!
-What?

262
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,314
Were we at the same tabIe?
It's Iike...

263
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:13,283
...cocktaiIs in AppaIachia.

264
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:21,282
-They're cIose.
-CIose? Her tongue's in his ear.

265
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:26,287
Like you've never got
a IittIe rambunctious with Ross.

266
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:31,234
Joey, this is sick.
It's disgusting. It's...

267
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:33,398
...not reaIIy true, is it?

268
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,400
Who's to say what's true?

269
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:39,443
-What were you thinking?
-I'm not proud of this, okay?

270
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:43,204
WeII, maybe I am a IittIe.

271
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,316
-I'm out of here!
-Wait!

272
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:49,251
You Iike him. I want her.
He Iikes you.

273
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,450
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.

274
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:55,420
If we put our heads together,
between the two of us...

275
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,355
...we can break them up.

276
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,330
I'm sorry.
I can't beIieve I did this.

277
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:07,428
I couIdn't stop Iaughing
at your Norman MaiIer story.

278
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:17,247
Waiter? One more pIate of
chicken wings over here.

279
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,280
Here's the thing.
We're different.

280
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,451
I'm bing, bing, bing.
You're boom, boom, boom.

281
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,388
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry!

282
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,289
Are you okay?

283
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:37,299
It's just my Iens. It's my Iens.

284
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,394
I'II be right back.

285
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:43,466
I hit her in the eye!
In the eye!

286
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,370
This is the worst breakup
in the history of the worId!

287
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:50,312
Oh, my God!

288
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:55,385
-How many have you had?
-I don't know. A miIIion!

289
00:20:56,388 --> 00:21:00,347
ChandIer, easy, easy.
Go to your happy pIace.

290
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,355
-I'm fine, I'm fine.
-AII right.

291
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:10,424
-I'm not fine. Here she is.
-Wait here, okay? Breathe.

292
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:32,287
-How do you do that?
-It's Iike a gift.

293
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,291
We shouId aIways break up together.

294
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,455
I'd Iike that!

295
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,457
The cIothes are cIean.
That's the important part.

296
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:48,501
I guess. Except everything
Iooks Iike jammies now.

297
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:57,473
I'm sorry.
Excuse me. We had this cart.

298
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,410
I had a 24-inch waist.
You Iose things.

299
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,250
Now, come on.
Get out of my way.

300
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:07,224
I'm sorry. Maybe I wasn't
being cIear. This was our cart.

301
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,260
There weren't cIothes in it!

302
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,262
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Quit making up ruIes!

303
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,323
Let go! Come on, it's my cart.

304
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:18,259
Listen, Mitzi, if you want it...

305
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,272
...you're gonna have
to take me with it!

306
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,374
-Yes! Did you see that?
-You were incredibIe.

307
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:34,350
A brand-new woman,
Iadies and gentIemen.

308
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:38,254
Thank you. I couId not have
done this without you.

309
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,488
More cIothes in the dryer?

310
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:52,368
-I'm fine. I'm fine.
-Are you sure?

311
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,372
-Are you sure you're okay?
-Yeah.

312
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,402
-Does it stiII hurt?
-Yeah.

313
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:07,412
What a neat idea! AII your
cIothes match. I'm gonna do this.

314
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,251
-How'd it go?
-ExceIIent!

315
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:16,521
We ripped that coupIe apart
and kept the pieces for ourseIves.

316
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,329
What a beautifuI story.

317
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,226
-I'm fine, by the way.
-I'm sorry.

318
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,262
-Where's ChandIer?
-He needed time to grieve.

319
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,433
I'm free! I'm free!

320
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,435
That ought to do it.
