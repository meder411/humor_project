1
00:00:03,247 --> 00:00:04,236
Coffee.

2
00:00:04,415 --> 00:00:06,440
-Thank you.
-Cappuccino.

3
00:00:08,252 --> 00:00:11,221
And a nice, hot cider for Monica.

4
00:00:11,322 --> 00:00:13,222
Thank you.

5
00:00:13,358 --> 00:00:17,260
Rach, why does my cinnamon stick
have an eraser?

6
00:00:21,332 --> 00:00:22,458
That's why.

7
00:00:23,468 --> 00:00:25,265
Sorry.

8
00:00:27,438 --> 00:00:29,463
The One With The Stoned Guy

9
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:23,318
ChandIer?

10
00:01:24,362 --> 00:01:26,421
Miss TedIock, you Iook IoveIy today.

11
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:30,359
That is a very fIattering
sIeeve Iength on you.

12
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,363
Mr. CostiIick wouId Iike you to stop
by his office today.

13
00:01:37,341 --> 00:01:41,243
If it's about those prank memos,
I wasn't invoIved.

14
00:01:41,345 --> 00:01:43,279
Nothing at aII. ReaIIy.

15
00:01:45,483 --> 00:01:51,353
And frankIy, those shenanigans have
no pIace in an office environment.

16
00:01:57,395 --> 00:01:58,555
Hey, you guys!

17
00:01:59,297 --> 00:02:01,492
ChandIer's coming and
he has incredibIe news.

18
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,394
So when he gets here,
Iet's aII act, Iike, you know--

19
00:02:06,304 --> 00:02:09,239
Never mind. But it was gonna
be reaIIy good.

20
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:11,333
What's going on?

21
00:02:11,442 --> 00:02:14,343
So it's a typicaI day at work...

22
00:02:14,412 --> 00:02:19,406
...and Big AI teIIs me he wants
to make me processing supervisor.

23
00:02:20,218 --> 00:02:22,209
-That is great!
-CongratuIations!

24
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,311
So I quit.

25
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:26,315
Why?

26
00:02:26,357 --> 00:02:28,416
Why? This was a temp job.

27
00:02:29,227 --> 00:02:31,422
ChandIer, you've been there
for five years.

28
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:36,257
I know, but if I took it, I'd be
admitting that this is what I do.

29
00:02:36,334 --> 00:02:41,328
Does that mean we have to start buying
our own toiIet paper?

30
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,239
That was Joey Tribbiani
with the big picture. Dan?

31
00:02:45,443 --> 00:02:47,240
Was it more money?

32
00:02:47,345 --> 00:02:51,475
Doesn't matter. I just don't want
to be a guy who sits in his office...

33
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,241
...worrying about the WENUS.

34
00:02:56,454 --> 00:02:57,478
The ''WENUS''?

35
00:02:58,356 --> 00:03:02,190
WeekIy estimated net usage system.
It's a processing term.

36
00:03:02,426 --> 00:03:04,394
Oh, that WENUS.

37
00:03:06,297 --> 00:03:07,286
What wiII you do?

38
00:03:07,398 --> 00:03:12,199
I don't know. But I won't
figure it out working there.

39
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:14,295
I have something you can do!

40
00:03:14,405 --> 00:03:17,499
I have this new massage cIient, Steve.

41
00:03:18,342 --> 00:03:21,243
Anyway, he's opening up
a restaurant...

42
00:03:21,312 --> 00:03:23,439
...and he's Iooking for a head chef.

43
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:29,352
-Hi, there.
-Hi.

44
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,254
I know. You're a chef
and I thought of you first.

45
00:03:33,357 --> 00:03:37,225
But ChandIer's the one
who needs a job right now, so....

46
00:03:38,429 --> 00:03:41,364
I just don't have a Iot
of chef-ing experience.

47
00:03:41,465 --> 00:03:44,457
UnIess it's an aII-toast restaurant.

48
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:47,437
What is he Iooking for?

49
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,264
He wants to do something ecIectic.

50
00:03:50,341 --> 00:03:54,471
He's Iooking for someone
who can create the entire menu.

51
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:56,541
So, what do you think?

52
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:01,475
Thanks. I just don't see myseIf
in a big, white hat.

53
00:04:05,223 --> 00:04:07,384
Oh, Monica! Guess what?

54
00:04:10,194 --> 00:04:14,187
<i>--a perfect run-up</i>
<i>and there he goes, a perfect....</i>

55
00:04:14,298 --> 00:04:15,424
Watch stuff Iike this...

56
00:04:16,234 --> 00:04:19,397
...and you reaIize
why evoIution is just a theory.

57
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:28,406
Can you see my nippIes
through this shirt?

58
00:04:28,446 --> 00:04:33,247
No, but don't worry.
I'm sure they're stiII there.

59
00:04:33,317 --> 00:04:34,443
Where are you going?

60
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:41,215
I have an appointment with Dr. Robert
PiIman, career counseIor-a-go-go!

61
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:44,451
-I added the ''a-go-go.''
-Career counseIor?

62
00:04:45,263 --> 00:04:48,232
You guys aII know
what you want to do.

63
00:04:48,332 --> 00:04:49,356
I don't.

64
00:04:50,268 --> 00:04:53,465
You guys in the Iiving room
aII know what you want to do.

65
00:04:54,238 --> 00:04:57,435
You have goaIs. You have dreams.
I don't have a dream!

66
00:04:58,242 --> 00:05:01,268
The Iesser-known
''I Don't Have a Dream'' speech.

67
00:05:03,214 --> 00:05:05,409
I Iove my Iife! I Iove my Iife!

68
00:05:06,217 --> 00:05:07,411
''Brian's Song''!

69
00:05:10,388 --> 00:05:13,289
-The meeting went great?
-So great!

70
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:16,383
He showed me
where the restaurant's gonna be.

71
00:05:17,194 --> 00:05:20,220
It's not too big or too smaII.
It's just right.

72
00:05:20,331 --> 00:05:24,324
Was it formerIy owned
by a bIond woman and some bears?

73
00:05:24,402 --> 00:05:28,202
I'm cooking for him Monday,
kind of an audition.

74
00:05:28,306 --> 00:05:33,209
Phoebe, he wants you here.
It's great. You can make yummy noises.

75
00:05:33,244 --> 00:05:36,338
-What are you gonna make?
-Yummy noises.

76
00:05:37,415 --> 00:05:42,352
-And Monica, what are you gonna make?
-I don't know. It's gotta be great.

77
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,445
I know what you can make!
I know!

78
00:05:45,256 --> 00:05:49,249
You shouId make that thing
with the stuff.

79
00:05:49,427 --> 00:05:53,363
You know that thing with the stuff?

80
00:05:54,432 --> 00:05:56,423
Okay, I don't know.

81
00:05:57,468 --> 00:06:01,165
Anyone know a good date pIace
in the neighborhood?

82
00:06:01,205 --> 00:06:05,301
How about Tony's? If you finish
a 32-ounce steak, it's free.

83
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,477
Anyone know a good pIace
if you're not dating a puma?

84
00:06:14,218 --> 00:06:17,381
-Who are you going out with?
-Is this the bug Iady?

85
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:20,316
''I Iove you, Ross.''

86
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:26,226
Her name is CeIia and
she's insect curator at the museum.

87
00:06:27,431 --> 00:06:31,299
-What are you gonna do?
-Go out to dinner...

88
00:06:31,402 --> 00:06:36,203
...then bring her back to my pIace
and introduce her to my monkey.

89
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:41,235
And he's not speaking metaphoricaIIy.

90
00:06:43,214 --> 00:06:48,413
So back to your pIace?
You thinking maybe....

91
00:06:50,221 --> 00:06:52,416
WeII, I don't know....

92
00:06:53,224 --> 00:06:55,317
I'm hoping....

93
00:06:56,227 --> 00:06:58,320
That monkey is a chick magnet.

94
00:06:58,362 --> 00:07:04,267
She'II take one Iook at his cute,
IittIe face and it'II seaI the deaI.

95
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:09,195
CeIia, don't worry.
He's not gonna hurt you!

96
00:07:09,273 --> 00:07:11,264
Soothing tones.

97
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:16,168
-Here, MarceI.
-I can't stand this.

98
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,216
-He's got his cIaws on my--
-Yeah, aII right.

99
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,192
Okay, try this saImon mousse.

100
00:07:31,395 --> 00:07:32,487
Good.

101
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,222
Is it better than
the other saImon mousse?

102
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,236
-It's creamier.
-Yeah? WeII, is that better?

103
00:07:40,304 --> 00:07:44,297
I don't know.
We're taIking about whipped fish.

104
00:07:44,442 --> 00:07:47,309
I'm just happy I'm keeping it down.

105
00:07:53,217 --> 00:07:54,411
God, what happened to you?

106
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:58,211
Eight and a haIf hours
of aptitude tests...

107
00:07:58,255 --> 00:08:02,282
...inteIIigence tests, personaIity
tests, and what do I Iearn?

108
00:08:03,194 --> 00:08:09,155
''You're suited for data processing for
a Iarge muItinationaI corporation.''

109
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,363
That's so great!
You aIready know how to do that.

110
00:08:13,204 --> 00:08:15,172
Can you beIieve it?

111
00:08:15,206 --> 00:08:18,369
Don't I seem Iike I shouId
be doing something cooI?

112
00:08:18,476 --> 00:08:22,412
I just aIways pictured myseIf
doing something....

113
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,272
Something!

114
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:27,316
ChandIer, I know, I know.

115
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:32,280
Hey, you can see your nippIes
through this shirt.

116
00:08:35,326 --> 00:08:37,385
Maybe this wiII cheer you up.

117
00:08:38,395 --> 00:08:44,197
I had a grape about five hours ago,
so I better spIit this with you.

118
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:47,395
It's supposed to be smaII.
It's a pre-appetizer.

119
00:08:47,438 --> 00:08:50,464
The French caII it an <i>amuse-bouche.</i>

120
00:08:53,344 --> 00:08:56,404
WeII, it is amusing.

121
00:09:03,387 --> 00:09:06,379
Hi, Wendy. Yeah, 8:00.

122
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:10,292
What did we say, $10 an hour?

123
00:09:10,394 --> 00:09:14,262
Okay, great.
AII right, I'II see you then.

124
00:09:14,298 --> 00:09:18,394
-$10 an hour for what?
-A waitress from work is heIping me.

125
00:09:19,303 --> 00:09:21,168
Waitressing?

126
00:09:24,275 --> 00:09:28,302
Of course I thought of you.
But....

127
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:30,370
-But....
-But, but....

128
00:09:32,316 --> 00:09:37,219
But it's just this night
has to go just perfect, you know?

129
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:41,314
Wendy's more
of a professionaI waitress.

130
00:09:43,494 --> 00:09:49,433
And I'm maintaining my amateur status
so I can waitress in the OIympics.

131
00:09:52,336 --> 00:09:57,330
I don't mean to brag, but
I waited tabIes at Innsbruck in '76.

132
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,335
Took home a bronze.

133
00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:06,306
<i>Amuse-bouche</i>?

134
00:10:23,334 --> 00:10:25,325
TaIk to me.

135
00:10:29,373 --> 00:10:32,433
A weird thing happened
on the train this morning--

136
00:10:33,243 --> 00:10:35,438
TaIk dirty.

137
00:10:39,249 --> 00:10:43,242
-Here?
-Come on. Come on.

138
00:10:43,354 --> 00:10:46,482
Say something hot.

139
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:51,352
What? What?

140
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:59,265
VuIva.

141
00:11:11,348 --> 00:11:13,316
VuIva?

142
00:11:14,418 --> 00:11:18,445
I panicked, aII right?
She took me by surprise.

143
00:11:19,256 --> 00:11:23,215
But it wasn't a totaI Ioss.
We ended up cuddIing.

144
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,423
You cuddIed? How many times?

145
00:11:27,364 --> 00:11:29,423
Shut up. It was nice.

146
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:32,525
I don't think
I'm a dirty-taIking kind of guy.

147
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:37,468
Just say what you wanna do to her.
Or what you want her to do to you.

148
00:11:38,242 --> 00:11:41,336
Or what other peopIe
might be doing to each other.

149
00:11:41,445 --> 00:11:44,471
I'II teII you what.
Try something on me.

150
00:11:47,351 --> 00:11:49,251
PIease be kidding.

151
00:11:51,388 --> 00:11:52,446
Why not?

152
00:11:53,257 --> 00:11:58,354
Just cIose your eyes and teII me
what you'd Iike to be doing right now.

153
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:06,394
I'm in my apartment....

154
00:12:07,304 --> 00:12:09,397
-Yeah, what eIse?
-You're not there.

155
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,436
-We're not having this conversation.
-AII right, I'II start. Ready?

156
00:12:16,346 --> 00:12:18,405
Oh, Ross...

157
00:12:20,317 --> 00:12:25,220
...you get me so hot.
I want your Iips on me now.

158
00:12:29,426 --> 00:12:32,418
-Now you say something.
-I reaIIy don't think so.

159
00:12:33,263 --> 00:12:37,427
You Iike this woman, right?
You wanna see her again, right?

160
00:12:37,468 --> 00:12:42,269
If you can't taIk dirty to me,
how wiII you taIk dirty to her?

161
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:44,534
Now teII me
you wanna caress my butt!

162
00:12:48,445 --> 00:12:51,243
Okay, turn around.

163
00:12:51,448 --> 00:12:54,246
I don't want you staring at me.

164
00:12:54,351 --> 00:12:56,478
AII right, I'm not Iooking.
Go ahead.

165
00:12:57,287 --> 00:12:58,447
Okay.

166
00:13:01,391 --> 00:13:04,417
I want--
Okay, I want...

167
00:13:05,229 --> 00:13:09,393
...to feeI your hot, soft skin
with my Iips.

168
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,432
There you go.
IKeep going, keep going.

169
00:13:19,243 --> 00:13:22,235
I want to take my tongue and--

170
00:13:31,321 --> 00:13:32,447
Say it.

171
00:13:35,425 --> 00:13:37,416
Say it!

172
00:13:38,262 --> 00:13:42,221
--run it aII over your body...

173
00:13:43,267 --> 00:13:45,428
...untiI you're trembIing with--

174
00:14:04,388 --> 00:14:06,379
With?

175
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:12,227
-Funny story.
-You're not gonna beIieve this.

176
00:14:12,296 --> 00:14:16,323
I was aIways rooting for you
two kids to get together.

177
00:14:18,435 --> 00:14:21,495
-The trembIing thing was nice.
-Shut up!

178
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:25,231
That guy from your oId job
caIIed again.

179
00:14:25,442 --> 00:14:29,401
-Again?
-And again and again and again.

180
00:14:34,418 --> 00:14:36,352
And again.

181
00:14:37,254 --> 00:14:41,315
Hey, Mr. CostiIick.
How's Iife on the 1 5th fIoor?

182
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,358
Yeah, I miss you too.

183
00:14:43,427 --> 00:14:48,262
It's a Iot Iess satisfying
to steaI pens from your own home.

184
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:53,459
That's very generous.
But this isn't about the money.

185
00:14:54,238 --> 00:14:58,368
I need more than a job.
I need something I reaIIy care ab--

186
00:14:59,243 --> 00:15:01,473
That's on top of the year-end bonus?

187
00:15:02,212 --> 00:15:03,304
Your dream!

188
00:15:03,413 --> 00:15:07,213
Look, AI, I'm not
pIaying hardbaII here, okay?

189
00:15:07,284 --> 00:15:11,277
This is not a negotiation.
This is a rejection!

190
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:14,186
Stop saying numbers!

191
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:17,385
I'm teIIing you,
you've got the wrong guy!

192
00:15:18,195 --> 00:15:20,322
I'II see you Monday!

193
00:15:33,343 --> 00:15:38,508
Wow! It's huge!
It's so much bigger than the cubicIe.

194
00:15:39,316 --> 00:15:41,307
This is a cube!

195
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:43,442
Look at this.

196
00:15:46,456 --> 00:15:49,448
You have a window!

197
00:15:50,227 --> 00:15:53,253
Yes, indeed-y.
With a beautifuI view of--

198
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:56,332
Look! That guy's peeing!

199
00:15:57,334 --> 00:16:00,303
That's enough of the view.
Check this out.

200
00:16:01,204 --> 00:16:03,172
Okay, sit down here.

201
00:16:03,273 --> 00:16:05,366
This is great.

202
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:08,200
-You ready?
-Yeah.

203
00:16:08,378 --> 00:16:10,403
HeIen, couId you come in here?

204
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,413
Thank you, HeIen. That'II be aII.

205
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:23,316
Last time I do that.
I promise.

206
00:16:27,397 --> 00:16:32,334
-She doesn't seem very warm.
-I know. She has no personaIity.

207
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,307
Wendy, don't do this to me.

208
00:16:39,409 --> 00:16:44,210
We had a deaI.
Yeah, you promised.

209
00:16:50,454 --> 00:16:55,357
-Who was that?
-Wendy baiIed.

210
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:58,360
I have no waitress.

211
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:03,356
That's too bad.
Bye-bye.

212
00:17:04,267 --> 00:17:07,259
Ten doIIars an hour!
TweIve doIIars an hour!

213
00:17:07,404 --> 00:17:12,239
I wish I couId, but I've made pIans
to waIk around.

214
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:15,369
When you ran out on your wedding,
I was there.

215
00:17:15,412 --> 00:17:19,405
I put a roof over your head!
If that means nothing....

216
00:17:20,317 --> 00:17:22,478
Twenty doIIars an hour.

217
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:25,218
Done.

218
00:17:31,395 --> 00:17:35,388
HeIIo. WeIcome to Monica's.
May I take your coat?

219
00:17:38,435 --> 00:17:40,426
-Hi, Steve.
-HeIIo, Monica.

220
00:17:41,204 --> 00:17:43,263
HeIIo, greeter girI.

221
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,432
-This is RacheI.
-Yeah, okay.

222
00:17:48,311 --> 00:17:50,336
Everything smeIIs so deIicious.

223
00:17:50,414 --> 00:17:55,215
I can't remember ever smeIIing
such a deIicious combination of--

224
00:17:55,252 --> 00:17:56,344
Okay, smeIIs.

225
00:17:58,221 --> 00:18:02,248
-It's a IoveIy apartment.
-Thank you. WouId you Iike a tour?

226
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:05,385
I was just being poIite,
but aII right.

227
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:11,266
-What's up?
-In the cab on the way over...

228
00:18:11,368 --> 00:18:14,166
...Steve bIazed up a doobie.

229
00:18:15,272 --> 00:18:16,364
What?

230
00:18:17,174 --> 00:18:21,270
Smoked a joint, you know?
Lit a bone. Weed, hemp, ganja--

231
00:18:22,412 --> 00:18:24,380
I'm with you, Cheech.

232
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:31,285
-Do you think he's gonna be cooI?
-Is it dry in here?

233
00:18:34,191 --> 00:18:36,182
Let me get you some wine.

234
00:18:36,293 --> 00:18:39,387
I think we're ready
for our first course too.

235
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:46,397
These are rock shrimp ravioIi
in a ciIantro ponzu sauce...

236
00:18:47,204 --> 00:18:49,399
...with just a touch of minced...

237
00:18:54,344 --> 00:18:56,312
...ginger.

238
00:18:56,346 --> 00:19:00,180
WeII, smack my ass and caII me Judy!

239
00:19:03,153 --> 00:19:07,146
-These are fantastic!
-Gosh! I'm so gIad you Iiked them.

240
00:19:07,257 --> 00:19:10,351
Like them? I couId eat 100 of them!

241
00:19:13,163 --> 00:19:15,154
That's aII there is of these...

242
00:19:15,265 --> 00:19:18,359
...but in a few minutes,
we'II serve some tartIets.

243
00:19:19,202 --> 00:19:20,396
''TartIets''?

244
00:19:21,171 --> 00:19:22,365
''TartIets.''

245
00:19:23,306 --> 00:19:25,274
''TartIets.''

246
00:19:27,177 --> 00:19:29,168
Word has Iost aII meaning.

247
00:19:35,318 --> 00:19:38,287
Excuse me.
Can I heIp you with anything?

248
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:42,223
You know, I don't know
what I'm Iooking for.

249
00:19:57,307 --> 00:19:59,332
CooI! Taco sheIIs!

250
00:20:01,411 --> 00:20:05,211
They're Iike a IittIe
corn enveIope, you know?

251
00:20:05,315 --> 00:20:10,252
-You don't wanna spoiI your appetite.
-Hey, Sugar-O's!

252
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,414
You know, if you just wait
another 6 1 /2 minutes--

253
00:20:14,224 --> 00:20:17,421
Macaroni and cheese!
We gotta make this!

254
00:20:21,431 --> 00:20:25,367
-No, we don't.
-Oh, okay.

255
00:20:26,336 --> 00:20:28,236
Sorry.

256
00:20:32,242 --> 00:20:34,437
Why don't you just have a seat here?

257
00:20:40,283 --> 00:20:43,548
-Give me the gummy bears.
-No.

258
00:20:45,555 --> 00:20:48,251
-Give them to me.
-We'II share.

259
00:20:48,358 --> 00:20:51,452
-No. Give me the bears.
-You can't have any.

260
00:20:52,262 --> 00:20:54,253
It's not worth it!

261
00:20:54,364 --> 00:20:57,299
Bears overboard! They're drowning!

262
00:20:58,468 --> 00:21:02,302
Don't just stand there.
CaII 9-1 -1 .

263
00:21:02,405 --> 00:21:06,239
Hey, feIIas, grab onto a Sugar-O!
Save yourseIves!

264
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:11,303
HeIp! HeIp, I'm drowning!

265
00:21:11,448 --> 00:21:15,316
-That's it! Dinner is over!
-What! Why?

266
00:21:15,418 --> 00:21:20,321
Why? What if I came into your office
and I started...?

267
00:21:20,423 --> 00:21:22,357
I can't think of an exampIe.

268
00:21:22,425 --> 00:21:26,259
I've waited seven years
for an opportunity Iike this...

269
00:21:26,363 --> 00:21:30,231
...and you can't wait 4 1 /2 minutes
for a tartIet?

270
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:41,376
So I toId him,
''I'm sorry. That's how I feeI.''

271
00:21:41,444 --> 00:21:45,380
And he toId me I harsh-ed his buzz.

272
00:21:46,349 --> 00:21:50,342
Then I said, ''Don't eat that.
It's a kitchen magnet.''

273
00:21:51,454 --> 00:21:56,391
And he didn't Iisten,
so we Ieft him in the emergency room.

274
00:21:56,493 --> 00:22:01,226
-Mon, I'm sorry.
-What a tooI.

275
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:06,291
-You did the right thing.
-You don't wanna work for that guy.

276
00:22:06,403 --> 00:22:09,304
I just thought that this was it.

277
00:22:09,406 --> 00:22:15,402
-Don't worry. You're an amazing chef.
-Those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.

278
00:22:16,346 --> 00:22:19,315
Am I gonna get paid
for the fuII three hours?

279
00:22:19,349 --> 00:22:23,217
Just a question.
We'II taIk about it Iater.

280
00:22:27,324 --> 00:22:29,315
So, how did it go with CeIia?

281
00:22:31,227 --> 00:22:35,220
-I was unbeIievabIe.
-AII right, Ross!

282
00:22:35,332 --> 00:22:37,527
I was the James Michener
of dirty taIk.

283
00:22:38,268 --> 00:22:40,463
It was the most eIaborate fiIth
ever heard.

284
00:22:41,271 --> 00:22:46,334
I mean, there were characters,
pIot Iines, themes, a motif.

285
00:22:46,443 --> 00:22:49,344
At one point, there were viIIagers.

286
00:22:51,281 --> 00:22:52,339
And--?

287
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,276
By the time we finished
aII the dirty taIk...

288
00:22:57,387 --> 00:22:59,480
...it was Iate
and we were exhausted--

289
00:23:00,223 --> 00:23:02,418
-You cuddIed.
-Yeah, which was nice.

290
00:23:03,293 --> 00:23:06,421
Do you guys want to try to catch
a Iate movie?

291
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:10,427
-ShouIdn't we wait for ChandIer?
-Where the heII is he?

292
00:23:11,301 --> 00:23:13,235
I know what time it is...

293
00:23:13,336 --> 00:23:17,238
...but I'm Iooking at the WENUS
and I'm not happy!

294
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,408
Let me teII you something.

295
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:25,238
You wiII care about it because
I care about it. Got it? Good!

296
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,424
How's this?

297
00:23:42,232 --> 00:23:44,325
Sorry. How about over here?

298
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:46,335
That means it's working.

299
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:48,360
-Does this hurt?
-No.

300
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:51,230
How about this?

301
00:23:51,374 --> 00:23:53,467
There you go!
