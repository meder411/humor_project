1
00:00:07,404 --> 00:00:10,464
She's having my baby,
and she's not here yet.

2
00:00:10,573 --> 00:00:13,474
-Has her water broken yet?
-I don't know.

3
00:00:14,277 --> 00:00:18,373
When we taIked, she said she'd
aIready passed the mucous pIug.

4
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:22,408
Do we have to know about that?

5
00:00:23,319 --> 00:00:25,412
What'II you do
when you have a baby?

6
00:00:25,488 --> 00:00:29,322
I'II be in the waiting room,
handing out cigars.

7
00:00:29,392 --> 00:00:34,386
Joey's made arrangements to have
his baby in a movie from the '50s.

8
00:00:35,398 --> 00:00:38,390
She couId be giving birth in the cab.

9
00:00:38,501 --> 00:00:41,595
ReIax. It's onIy $2
for the first contraction...

10
00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:46,398
...and then 50 cents for each
additionaI contraction.

11
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:49,603
What, it's okay
when ChandIer does it?

12
00:00:50,346 --> 00:00:52,541
You have to pick your moments.

13
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:54,508
Did I miss it?

14
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:57,520
-She's not here yet.
-What's with the guitar?

15
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:02,257
We might be here for a whiIe.
Things might get musicaI.

16
00:01:02,392 --> 00:01:06,260
-Where have you been?
-We stopped at the gift shop.

17
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:08,388
I got this,
and Susan wanted a Chunky.

18
00:01:08,465 --> 00:01:12,492
You're having a baby.
You don't stop for Chunkies.

19
00:01:13,303 --> 00:01:16,272
I used to have that bumper sticker.

20
00:01:16,473 --> 00:01:18,498
You see what I mean?

21
00:01:19,375 --> 00:01:21,468
The One With the Birth

22
00:02:05,488 --> 00:02:09,288
-''Stopped for a Chunky.''
-Let it go, Ross.

23
00:02:09,392 --> 00:02:11,383
I got an extra one.
You want this?

24
00:02:15,398 --> 00:02:19,300
-How's my favorite parenting team?
-Dr. FranzbIau.

25
00:02:19,369 --> 00:02:22,361
I understand you're thinking
of having a baby.

26
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:26,398
I see you're nine months pregnant.
That's a good start.

27
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,279
-How are your contractions?
-I Iove them.

28
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,474
Each one's Iike a IittIe party
in my uterus.

29
00:02:34,284 --> 00:02:38,311
-Every 4 minutes, Iasting 55 seconds.
-59 seconds. Quartz.

30
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:40,378
Swiss quartz.

31
00:02:42,492 --> 00:02:45,484
-Am I aIIowed to drink anything?
-Ice chips.

32
00:02:45,595 --> 00:02:48,393
-At the nurse's station.
-I'II get it!

33
00:02:48,498 --> 00:02:51,399
-No, I'II get it.
-No, I'm getting it.

34
00:02:52,502 --> 00:02:56,302
Hi. Thought you might Iike
some ice chips.

35
00:02:56,506 --> 00:02:59,532
-Thanks.
-And if you need anything eIse-- I...

36
00:03:00,276 --> 00:03:01,470
...do not beIieve we've met.

37
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:04,471
I'm RacheI Greene.

38
00:03:05,281 --> 00:03:08,341
I'm CaroI's ex-husband's
sister's roommate.

39
00:03:08,484 --> 00:03:11,351
Nice to meet you.
I'm Dr. FranzbIau.

40
00:03:11,387 --> 00:03:16,347
I'm your roommate's brother's
ex-wife's obstetrician.

41
00:03:16,492 --> 00:03:18,357
Oh, that's funny.

42
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:27,360
I want a baby.

43
00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:31,271
Not tonight, honey.
I got an earIy day tomorrow.

44
00:03:31,307 --> 00:03:35,573
-Get up. Let's get some coffee.
-Okay, because we never do that.

45
00:03:37,313 --> 00:03:41,374
Shoot, shoot, shoot.
Or just faII down. That's good too.

46
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:43,407
IKnick fan?

47
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,286
-Oh, boy, do they suck.
-Listen, Iady--

48
00:03:49,492 --> 00:03:51,585
Look. Look at your man, Ewing.

49
00:03:52,328 --> 00:03:55,422
He couIdn't hit water
if he was standing on a boat.

50
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:58,398
-And who do you Iike?
-CeItics.

51
00:03:58,434 --> 00:04:01,426
CeItics? They couIdn't hit a boat if--

52
00:04:02,238 --> 00:04:03,466
Wait....

53
00:04:04,474 --> 00:04:06,465
They suck, aII right?

54
00:04:07,343 --> 00:04:09,436
Shut up.
It's a rebuiIding year--

55
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:15,249
Let me get the father.
We need a father over here.

56
00:04:15,351 --> 00:04:17,285
There's no father.

57
00:04:19,255 --> 00:04:23,248
-Oh, sorry.
-That's okay. I'm fine.

58
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,394
Okay. Right this way.

59
00:04:26,462 --> 00:04:30,398
AII the other pregnant women
seem to be going in here.

60
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:40,374
<i>They're tiny and chubby</i>
<i>And so sweet to touch</i>

61
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,312
<i>But soon they'll grow up</i>
<i>And resent you so much</i>

62
00:04:46,316 --> 00:04:50,275
<i>Now they're yelling at you</i>
<i>And you don't know why</i>

63
00:04:50,386 --> 00:04:54,379
<i>And you cry and you cry</i>
<i>And you cry</i>

64
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:57,484
<i>And you cry and you cry</i>
<i>And you cry</i>

65
00:04:57,527 --> 00:05:01,258
-Thanks, Ross.
-I'm paying you to stop.

66
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:07,325
Oh, Iook, twins.
Hi, guys. Oh, cute.

67
00:05:08,438 --> 00:05:09,427
No fair.

68
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:12,434
I don't even have one.
How come they get two?

69
00:05:13,242 --> 00:05:15,369
-You'II get one.
-When?

70
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:20,438
TeII you what. When we're 40,
if neither of us are married...

71
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,478
...what do you say we have one?

72
00:05:23,252 --> 00:05:26,244
Why won't I be married
when I'm 40?

73
00:05:26,356 --> 00:05:28,290
I just meant hypotheticaIIy.

74
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:32,384
HypotheticaIIy, why won't I be
married when I'm 40?

75
00:05:33,262 --> 00:05:37,392
What is it? Is there something
unmarriabIe about me?

76
00:05:38,368 --> 00:05:39,494
WeII?

77
00:05:40,303 --> 00:05:43,272
Dear God!
This parachute is a knapsack.

78
00:05:47,477 --> 00:05:49,502
Look at you, dressy-dress.

79
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,574
Did you go home and change?

80
00:05:52,315 --> 00:05:55,512
It's an important day.
I want to Iook nice.

81
00:05:56,386 --> 00:05:58,377
Has Dr. FranzbIau been by--?

82
00:05:59,522 --> 00:06:01,217
I haven't seen him.

83
00:06:01,324 --> 00:06:04,225
Where is he?
He is supposed to be here.

84
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:08,320
What if the baby needs him?

85
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:13,232
What's the deaI with you and doctors?
Is your father a doctor?

86
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:14,327
Yeah. Why?

87
00:06:15,438 --> 00:06:17,269
No reason.

88
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,271
Mom, we've been through this.

89
00:06:21,344 --> 00:06:23,471
No, I am not caIIing him.

90
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,340
I don't care if it is his kid,
the guy's a jerk.

91
00:06:27,383 --> 00:06:31,251
No, I am not aIone.
Joey's here.

92
00:06:32,255 --> 00:06:33,483
What do you mean ''Joey who''?

93
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:35,281
<i>Joey who?</i>

94
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:38,383
-Tribbiani.
-Joey Tribbiani.

95
00:06:39,462 --> 00:06:43,398
Yes. Okay. HoId on.

96
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:45,490
She wants to taIk to you.

97
00:06:46,402 --> 00:06:47,562
Take the phone.

98
00:06:49,372 --> 00:06:50,464
Yeah, it's me.

99
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,366
No, we're just friends.

100
00:06:55,378 --> 00:06:56,504
Yeah, I'm singIe.

101
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,277
Twenty-five.

102
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:02,417
An actor. HeIIo?

103
00:07:07,423 --> 00:07:10,256
She's not much of a phone person.

104
00:07:10,326 --> 00:07:14,228
So, what's the deaI
with this father guy?

105
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:18,266
If someone was having my baby,
I'd wanna know about it.

106
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:23,327
Hey, IKnick fan, am I interested
in your views on fatherhood? No.

107
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:29,267
-Maybe I shouId just go.
-Maybe you shouId.

108
00:07:29,378 --> 00:07:31,243
Good Iuck...

109
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:34,249
...and take care.

110
00:07:40,356 --> 00:07:43,450
The CeItics probIem is that
the pIayers run the team.

111
00:07:43,493 --> 00:07:47,259
-That is so not true.
-Oh, it is.

112
00:07:47,296 --> 00:07:49,264
-Breathe.
-Breathe.

113
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:51,364
You're gonna kiII me.

114
00:07:52,268 --> 00:07:56,261
-Fifteen more seconds. 1 4, 13, 1 2--
-Count faster.

115
00:07:56,372 --> 00:08:00,308
It'II be okay. IKeep focusing on Jordy.
He'II be here soon.

116
00:08:00,343 --> 00:08:04,404
-Three. Two. Who the heII is Jordy?
-Your son.

117
00:08:05,214 --> 00:08:09,207
I don't have a son named Jordy.
We aII agreed on Jamie.

118
00:08:09,252 --> 00:08:12,312
Jamie was the name
of Susan's first girIfriend...

119
00:08:12,355 --> 00:08:14,346
...so we went back to Jordy.

120
00:08:14,524 --> 00:08:19,223
What do you mean, back to Jordy?
We never Ianded on Jordy.

121
00:08:19,262 --> 00:08:23,460
We just passed by it during the whoIe
Jesse-Cody-DiIIon fiasco.

122
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,426
Ow! Leg cramp!

123
00:08:27,236 --> 00:08:29,329
-I got it.
-I got it. I'm doing it.

124
00:08:29,372 --> 00:08:31,465
You get to sIeep with her.
I get the cramps.

125
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:33,265
No, you don't.

126
00:08:33,342 --> 00:08:35,435
That is it.
I want both of you out.

127
00:08:35,478 --> 00:08:37,343
-She started it.
-He did.

128
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,440
I'm trying to get
a person out of my body here...

129
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,243
...and you're not making it
any easier! Now go!

130
00:08:47,256 --> 00:08:48,484
-Thanks.
-See what you did?

131
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:51,260
-Listen--
-Out!

132
00:08:53,296 --> 00:08:55,457
Breathe. Breathe.

133
00:09:02,238 --> 00:09:05,298
What is that? Something expIoded.

134
00:09:06,342 --> 00:09:09,505
-That's not the baby, is it?
-Her water broke. CaIm down.

135
00:09:10,246 --> 00:09:13,306
Water breaking?
What do you mean? What's that?

136
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,350
Breathe. Breathe.

137
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:22,357
I'm okay. I'm okay.
That's disgusting. I'm okay.

138
00:09:23,326 --> 00:09:26,420
-This is so your fauIt.
-How is this my fauIt?

139
00:09:26,462 --> 00:09:30,262
CaroI never threw me out
of a room before you.

140
00:09:30,366 --> 00:09:34,234
There's a Iot of things
CaroI never did before me.

141
00:09:34,437 --> 00:09:39,238
-Are you trying to be cIever?
-You're so threatened by me.

142
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:43,336
Hey. Okay, aII right.
That's it. Get in here.

143
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:46,473
My God, you guys.
I don't beIieve you.

144
00:09:47,283 --> 00:09:50,275
There are chiIdren
coming into the worId here...

145
00:09:50,386 --> 00:09:54,254
...and your fighting isn't
the first thing they shouId hear.

146
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,451
So stop aII the yeIIing!
Just stop it!

147
00:09:59,395 --> 00:10:04,298
Don't make me do this again!
I don't Iike my voice Iike this!

148
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:11,397
Who wants to hear something ironic?

149
00:10:15,478 --> 00:10:17,469
Are they here yet?

150
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,373
Don't worry,
we're gonna find them.

151
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:23,510
And untiI we do,
we are aII here for you. Okay?

152
00:10:25,421 --> 00:10:28,515
You were teIIing me
about Paris. It sounds wonderfuI.

153
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:33,489
There was this great IittIe
pastry shop right by my hoteI--

154
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:36,293
There you go, dear.

155
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:40,496
-You find them?
-Not in the gift shop or cafeteria....

156
00:10:40,603 --> 00:10:43,299
Where are Phoebe and Joey?

157
00:10:43,506 --> 00:10:46,407
There's something sinister
going on here.

158
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:50,411
If you find anyone,
or parts of anyone...

159
00:10:50,513 --> 00:10:54,506
...scream. And scream again.

160
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,353
-HeIp!
-Come on!

161
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:04,257
-I'm having a baby in there!
-HeIIo!

162
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,453
Okay, everyone stand back.

163
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:11,288
Ow.

164
00:11:12,368 --> 00:11:15,394
AII right, good thing
we're in a hospitaI.

165
00:11:16,372 --> 00:11:18,363
Come on, Lydia, you can do it.

166
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:21,409
Push him out, push him out.
Harder, harder.

167
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:24,303
Push him out, push him out.
Way out.

168
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,315
Let's get that baII and reaIIy move.

169
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,407
Let's get--

170
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:35,321
I was just-- Yeah, okay.
Push, push, push.

171
00:11:37,393 --> 00:11:40,294
What are you gonna do,
suck the door open?

172
00:11:42,431 --> 00:11:45,298
HeIp! HeIp!

173
00:11:46,302 --> 00:11:50,295
<i>And they found their bodies</i>
<i>The very next day</i>

174
00:11:50,406 --> 00:11:54,399
<i>And they found their bodies</i>
<i>The very next--</i>

175
00:11:59,415 --> 00:12:01,349
Mom, everything's going fine.

176
00:12:01,383 --> 00:12:03,248
Ross is great.

177
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:05,550
He's in a whoIe other pIace.

178
00:12:06,388 --> 00:12:08,253
No, he's gone.

179
00:12:08,457 --> 00:12:11,483
No, you don't have to fIy back.
ReaIIy.

180
00:12:12,261 --> 00:12:16,391
What do you mean ''This might be your
onIy chance''? I'm onIy 26.

181
00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:20,367
I'm not even thinking
about babies yet.

182
00:12:32,481 --> 00:12:35,473
-Where have you been?
-I just had a baby.

183
00:12:37,386 --> 00:12:38,478
MazeI tov.

184
00:12:43,392 --> 00:12:45,383
It couId be one hour or three.

185
00:12:45,427 --> 00:12:47,486
But reIax.
She's doing great.

186
00:12:48,297 --> 00:12:52,427
So teII me, are you currentIy
invoIved with anyone?

187
00:12:53,435 --> 00:12:56,529
Not at the moment, I'm not. Are you?

188
00:12:57,306 --> 00:13:00,332
No, it's hard enough to get women
to go out with me.

189
00:13:00,442 --> 00:13:04,378
Right. Yeah, I've heard that
about cute doctors.

190
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,248
No, reaIIy. I suppose it's because
I spend so much time, you know...

191
00:13:10,452 --> 00:13:12,249
...where I do.

192
00:13:15,357 --> 00:13:18,349
I try not to Iet work
affect my personaI Iife.

193
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:23,295
But it's hard when, when you do
what I do. It's, Iike....

194
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,560
WeII, for instance,
what do you do?

195
00:13:26,302 --> 00:13:27,394
I'm a waitress.

196
00:13:28,504 --> 00:13:33,407
Aren't there times when you come home
at night and you're, Iike:

197
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:37,468
''If I see one more cup of coffee....''

198
00:13:42,418 --> 00:13:44,318
Gotcha.

199
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:48,479
-I'm gonna check up on your friend.
-That's fine.

200
00:13:57,433 --> 00:14:00,459
-How'd you know I was here?
-Your mom caIIed me.

201
00:14:01,337 --> 00:14:03,328
So is this her?

202
00:14:03,372 --> 00:14:05,431
No, this is a Ioaner.

203
00:14:07,376 --> 00:14:09,537
Ours is at the shop.

204
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,543
God, I hope she has my brains.

205
00:14:14,383 --> 00:14:17,352
I'm sorry you had to do this
by yourseIf.

206
00:14:17,553 --> 00:14:22,490
I wasn't by myseIf. I had a doctor,
a nurse and a heIper guy.

207
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:29,456
-So did you see who won the game?
-The IKnicks by 10. They suck.

208
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,461
They're not so bad.

209
00:14:56,492 --> 00:14:58,392
Come on. Come on.

210
00:14:58,494 --> 00:15:03,261
-You're doing it too hard.
-You have to do it hard or eIse--

211
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:05,257
Damn it. Damn it.

212
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:07,460
Damn it, damn it.
This is aII your fauIt.

213
00:15:08,237 --> 00:15:10,364
This shouId be
the greatest day of my Iife.

214
00:15:10,472 --> 00:15:13,339
My son is being born,
and I shouId be in there.

215
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:15,434
Instead, I'm stuck
in a cIoset with you.

216
00:15:16,245 --> 00:15:19,271
I have been waiting for this
as much as you.

217
00:15:19,381 --> 00:15:22,441
No one's been waiting
for this as much as I have.

218
00:15:22,484 --> 00:15:24,281
You know what's funny?

219
00:15:24,353 --> 00:15:27,481
You go home with the baby.
Where does that Ieave me?

220
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,382
You're his father.

221
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:33,451
Who am I? There's Father's Day.
There's Mother's Day.

222
00:15:33,495 --> 00:15:36,293
There's no Lesbian Lover Day.

223
00:15:36,398 --> 00:15:38,491
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.

224
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,405
This is so great.

225
00:15:47,409 --> 00:15:49,468
Do you wanna expIain that?

226
00:15:49,578 --> 00:15:53,275
I mean, when I was growing up,
my dad Ieft...

227
00:15:53,382 --> 00:15:57,284
...and my mother died
and my stepfather went to jaiI.

228
00:15:57,386 --> 00:16:00,446
I bareIy had enough pieces
to make one whoIe parent.

229
00:16:01,323 --> 00:16:04,417
And here's this baby who has
three whoIe parents...

230
00:16:04,526 --> 00:16:08,462
...who fight over
who gets to Iove it the most...

231
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:11,256
...and it's not even born yet.

232
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:15,267
It's just the Iuckiest baby
in the whoIe worId.

233
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:19,332
I'm sorry. You were fighting.

234
00:16:21,276 --> 00:16:22,436
Where are they?

235
00:16:22,544 --> 00:16:25,445
-They'II be here.
-They wouIdn't miss this.

236
00:16:26,248 --> 00:16:31,345
ReIax. You're onIy at 9 centimeters,
and the baby's at zero station.

237
00:16:34,356 --> 00:16:36,290
You are reaIIy frightening me.

238
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,488
Somebody wanna heIp me?
Trying to rip out my heart.

239
00:16:43,265 --> 00:16:45,392
That's great.
Anybody seen a nippIe?

240
00:16:47,503 --> 00:16:50,267
Ten centimeters.
Here we go.

241
00:16:50,305 --> 00:16:53,365
-Time to start pushing.
-But they're not here yet.

242
00:16:53,475 --> 00:16:58,276
-I can't teII the baby to wait.
-Oh, God.

243
00:17:02,351 --> 00:17:05,343
-Okay, got the vent open.
-Hi, I'm Ben.

244
00:17:07,322 --> 00:17:09,415
I'm hospitaI worker Ben.

245
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:12,226
It's Ben to the rescue.

246
00:17:14,463 --> 00:17:17,432
Ben, you ready? Give me your foot.

247
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:21,464
On three, Ben.
One, two, three.

248
00:17:22,337 --> 00:17:25,363
Come on, Ben.
That's it, Ben.

249
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,467
What do you see?

250
00:17:28,544 --> 00:17:32,241
I see what appears to be
a dark vent.

251
00:17:32,314 --> 00:17:33,338
Wait.

252
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:36,441
Yes, it is, in fact, a dark vent.

253
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:42,382
Pheebs, it's open.
It's open.

254
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,454
Wait. You forgot your Iegs.

255
00:17:49,398 --> 00:17:52,458
-Push. Push.
-We're here. We're here.

256
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:55,395
Where have you been?

257
00:17:56,405 --> 00:17:57,463
Long story.

258
00:17:57,506 --> 00:18:03,274
I need you to keep pushing.
I need-- Excuse me, can I have this?

259
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:08,272
There's too many peopIe here.
There's about to be one more.

260
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:13,354
So if you're not an ex-husband or
Iesbian Iife partner, out you go.

261
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:17,317
-Bye-bye.
-Good Iuck, you guys.

262
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:21,318
Do you have to be
CaroI's Iesbian Iife partner?

263
00:18:21,363 --> 00:18:22,421
Out.

264
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:26,323
Here he comes.

265
00:18:26,435 --> 00:18:29,336
Let me see. I've gotta see.

266
00:18:33,475 --> 00:18:35,238
A head.

267
00:18:35,444 --> 00:18:38,242
It's huge.
How are you doing this?

268
00:18:39,348 --> 00:18:41,339
You're not heIping.

269
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,350
You're doing great.

270
00:18:43,452 --> 00:18:45,386
-HeIIo?
-Oh, sorry.

271
00:18:45,454 --> 00:18:47,445
What do you see?
What do you see?

272
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:53,354
We got a head. We got arms.
Oh, Iook at the IittIe fingers.

273
00:18:53,495 --> 00:18:55,395
A chest and a stomach...

274
00:18:55,497 --> 00:18:59,365
...and it's a boy, definiteIy a boy.

275
00:18:59,468 --> 00:19:01,402
Legs, knees and feet.

276
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,234
He's here.

277
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:12,437
He's a person.

278
00:19:13,315 --> 00:19:15,306
-Look.
-What does he Iook Iike?

279
00:19:16,218 --> 00:19:19,312
IKind of Iike my UncIe Ed,
covered in JeII-O.

280
00:19:20,322 --> 00:19:21,414
ReaIIy?

281
00:19:22,257 --> 00:19:24,316
<i>You guys, he's beautiful.</i>

282
00:19:24,426 --> 00:19:26,326
Thanks, Pheebs.

283
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:37,236
No shouting, but we stiII need
a name for this IittIe guy.

284
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,233
-How about Ben?
-I Iike Ben.

285
00:19:42,444 --> 00:19:43,536
Ben.

286
00:19:48,283 --> 00:19:51,377
Ben's good. How come you never
mentioned Ben before?

287
00:19:51,486 --> 00:19:54,353
We just cooked it up.

288
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,381
That's what we were off doing.

289
00:20:00,462 --> 00:20:03,295
-Can we come in?
-Yeah, come on.

290
00:20:10,405 --> 00:20:12,305
I know. I know.

291
00:20:12,374 --> 00:20:15,468
Everybody, there's someone
I'd Iike you to meet.

292
00:20:16,411 --> 00:20:19,312
-This is Ben.
-Hi, Ben.

293
00:20:19,381 --> 00:20:21,315
Ben, this is everybody.

294
00:20:22,384 --> 00:20:24,477

295
00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:28,513
Thanks.

296
00:20:29,391 --> 00:20:32,485
I can't beIieve one of us
actuaIIy has one of these.

297
00:20:33,295 --> 00:20:35,388
I know.
I stiII am one of these.

298
00:20:39,401 --> 00:20:40,493
Can I?

299
00:20:42,437 --> 00:20:45,429
Okay, the head. You gotta....

300
00:20:54,316 --> 00:20:56,511
I'm your Aunt Monica.
Yes, I am.

301
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:59,310
I'm your Aunt Monica.

302
00:21:04,459 --> 00:21:06,359
I wiII aIways have gum.

303
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,358

304
00:21:13,268 --> 00:21:16,465
...I want you to know that
there may be some times when...

305
00:21:17,272 --> 00:21:20,469
...I may not be around Iike this.

Yeah, I know. Look at him.

315
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,452
Nothing.
I don't think that's his name.

316
00:22:16,298 --> 00:22:18,459
Look, he's cIosing his eyes.

Look, he's opening his eyes.

He doesn't do much, does he?

Nope, this is pretty much it.
