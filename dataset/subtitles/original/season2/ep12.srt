1
00:00:09,298 --> 00:00:12,290
<i>Can't get the monkey off your back?</i>

2
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:14,426
<i>Then put it in your mouth...</i>

3
00:00:14,503 --> 00:00:16,403
<i>... with Monkeyshine Beer.</i>

4
00:00:16,505 --> 00:00:19,338
<i>Get it, monkey</i>

5
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:22,343
<i>Get it, get it, monkey</i>

6
00:00:24,413 --> 00:00:25,505
<i>Monkey, monkey</i>

7
00:00:25,614 --> 00:00:27,411
<i>Monkeyshine Beer.</i>

8
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,509
<i>'Cause it's a jungle out there.</i>

9
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:32,446
That commerciaI aIways makes me sad.

10
00:00:32,555 --> 00:00:36,321
But the guy opens his beer,
the girIs run at him...

11
00:00:36,425 --> 00:00:38,359
...so everything works out okay.

12
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:41,530
I meant,
the monkey reminds me of MarceI.

13
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:43,320
I can see that.

14
00:00:43,365 --> 00:00:48,325
Because they both have those big
brown eyes and the IittIe pouty chin.

15
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,565
And the fact that
they're both monkeys?

16
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,475
Did I do the right thing,
giving him away?

17
00:00:54,543 --> 00:00:58,536
Ross, you had to.
He was humping everything in sight.

18
00:00:59,348 --> 00:01:02,511
My MaIibu Barbie won't
be wearing white to her wedding.

19
00:01:05,354 --> 00:01:07,515
Remember when he'd borrow your hat...

20
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,317
...and when you got it back,
there'd be monkey raisins in it?

21
00:01:13,395 --> 00:01:14,419
He Ioved that joke.

22
00:01:14,497 --> 00:01:18,433
When he did it, it was funny.
When I did it to my boss...

23
00:01:19,502 --> 00:01:22,494
...suddenIy I had this big
attitude probIem.

24
00:01:23,405 --> 00:01:25,396
The One After the SuperbowI

25
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,447
Hey, check it out.
Guess what I got?

26
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:15,285
Rhythm?

27
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:18,316
No. My first fan maiI.

28
00:02:20,396 --> 00:02:21,522
''Dear Dr. Ramoray:

29
00:02:22,298 --> 00:02:25,392
I Iove you and wouId do
anything to have you.''

30
00:02:25,434 --> 00:02:29,302
My gosh. ''Your not-so-secret
admirer, Erika Ford.''

31
00:02:30,306 --> 00:02:31,295
Oh, wait.

32
00:02:31,407 --> 00:02:35,537
''P.S. EncIosed, pIease find
1 4 of my eyeIashes.''

33
00:02:37,413 --> 00:02:40,405
In Crazy WorId, that means
you're married.

34
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:47,454
It's not addressed to <i>Days of our</i>
<i>Lives.</i> It came to your apartment.

35
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:50,515
-She was in our buiIding.
-Oh, my God.

36
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,428
I got my very own staIker.

37
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:59,365
You're so Iucky.
I have to share with guys at work.

38
00:03:00,502 --> 00:03:06,304
Remember we taIked about ''good thing,
bad thing''? This is a bad thing.

39
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:09,267
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

40
00:03:09,378 --> 00:03:10,504
Where are you off to?

41
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,475
There's a paIeontoIogy
conference in L.A.

42
00:03:14,283 --> 00:03:18,276
I figured I'd go, drive down
to the zoo and surprise MarceI.

43
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,416
He wiII be surprised.
TiII he reaIizes he's a monkey...

44
00:03:23,392 --> 00:03:25,519
...and isn't capabIe of that emotion.

45
00:03:28,297 --> 00:03:30,492
Phoebe?
That cute guy is here again.

46
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:33,393
Okay, so everyone...

47
00:03:33,435 --> 00:03:36,598
...pretend I'm teIIing a story.
It's reaIIy funny.

48
00:03:37,339 --> 00:03:39,330
So everyone just Iaugh.
Now!

49
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:42,409
I know, I know.

50
00:03:43,412 --> 00:03:45,607
-HeIIo.
-Hi.

51
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:48,509
-I'm Rob Donnen.
-Hi, Rob Donnen.

52
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:53,317
I don't know a thing about music
but I think you're great.

53
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:55,514
Oh! Wow.

54
00:03:55,557 --> 00:03:59,550
Anyway, I scheduIe performers
for chiIdren's Iibraries.

55
00:04:00,296 --> 00:04:04,460
I was thinking, have you thought
about pIaying your songs for kids?

56
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:07,360
I wouId Iove to have kids...

57
00:04:10,472 --> 00:04:14,374
...hear me pIay the songs
that I wiII write for them.

58
00:04:16,378 --> 00:04:18,278
What'II we do for dinner?

59
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,371
We couId cook for ourseIves.

60
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:28,381
-HeIIo.
<i>-It's Erika.</i>

61
00:04:28,524 --> 00:04:30,321
My God. The staIker!

62
00:04:30,426 --> 00:04:31,484
<i>It's open.</i>

63
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,491
Hit her with a frying pan.
Good idea.

64
00:04:36,532 --> 00:04:40,491
But we want a backup pIan,
in case she isn't a cartoon.

65
00:04:42,304 --> 00:04:43,498
Let's get out of here.

66
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:48,533
The one time they're not home.

67
00:04:50,412 --> 00:04:55,349
We'II Ieave. When we pass her, she
won't know it's me. We've never met.

68
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:59,617
That's how radio stars
escape staIkers.

69
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,450
She's coming.

70
00:05:08,464 --> 00:05:10,261
It's me.

71
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:13,401
This is it.
This is how we're gonna die.

72
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,394
You ready?

73
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:17,363
Wait, wait, wait.

74
00:05:26,315 --> 00:05:27,373
Erika!

75
00:05:37,426 --> 00:05:39,291
-Mr. GeIIer?
-Yes, hi.

76
00:05:39,395 --> 00:05:41,522
Dean Lipson, zoo administrator.

77
00:05:42,331 --> 00:05:43,525
You had a question?

78
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:47,425
I can't find the monkey
I donated Iast year.

79
00:05:47,503 --> 00:05:50,495
He's a capuchin,
answers to the name MarceI?

80
00:05:51,407 --> 00:05:54,399
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

81
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,603
MarceI has passed on.

82
00:05:58,514 --> 00:06:01,347
Oh, my God! What happened?

83
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,283
He got sick,
and then he got sicker...

84
00:06:04,353 --> 00:06:06,344
...then he got a IittIe better.

85
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:08,382
But then he died.

86
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,386
I can't beIieve this.

87
00:06:12,494 --> 00:06:17,397
I'm sorry, Mr. GeIIer.
But you know, there's an oId saying:

88
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:20,366
''Sometimes monkeys die.''

89
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:24,364
It's not a great saying...

90
00:06:25,307 --> 00:06:27,468
...but it certainIy is fitting today.

91
00:06:28,277 --> 00:06:30,507
-Someone shouId've caIIed me.
-I'm sorry.

92
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,308
Look, I know this can't bring him
back, but here. It's just a gesture.

93
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,316
Zoo doIIars?

94
00:06:39,421 --> 00:06:43,482
Yes, and come see the bird show at 4.
The macaws wear hats.

95
00:06:45,394 --> 00:06:48,386
It's cuter if your monkey
hasn't just died.

96
00:06:57,339 --> 00:06:58,431
I know.

97
00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:04,377
I can't beIieve Joey's having Iunch
with his staIker. What is she Iike?

98
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:07,279
Remember Kathy Bates in <i>Misery</i>?

99
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:10,375
WeII, she Iooks
the exact opposite of that.

100
00:07:11,386 --> 00:07:13,354
And she's not crazy?

101
00:07:13,455 --> 00:07:15,480
Oh, no.
She's a totaI whack-job.

102
00:07:16,358 --> 00:07:20,351
She thinks that Joey is
actuaIIy Dr. Drake Ramoray.

103
00:07:20,462 --> 00:07:22,293
Oh, my God.

104
00:07:22,364 --> 00:07:26,300
And he's going out with her?
He cannot pursue this.

105
00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:30,395
Just because she thinks she can truIy
see Joey through her magic box...

106
00:07:30,472 --> 00:07:33,270
...doesn't mean she's not a person.

107
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,367
Does she not deserve happiness
or Iove?

108
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:41,472
Why are you Iooking at me?
He wants to boff the maniac.

109
00:07:42,584 --> 00:07:44,313
Are you okay?

110
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:46,320
No, I'm nervous.

111
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:49,481
Maybe if I picture them
in their underwear....

112
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:54,285
That's not a good idea.
That's why the Iast guy got fired.

113
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,325
I'm used to pIaying for grownups.

114
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:03,429
Grownups drink coffee,
do their grownup thing.

115
00:08:04,273 --> 00:08:06,434
And kids Iisten.

116
00:08:08,243 --> 00:08:10,438
It's just a huge responsibiIity.

117
00:08:11,246 --> 00:08:12,235
What?

118
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:14,281
Are you gonna kiss me?

119
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,444
I was thinking about it.

120
00:08:17,386 --> 00:08:18,375
Okay.

121
00:08:21,456 --> 00:08:24,357
AIrighty. Let's pIay some tunes.

122
00:08:26,295 --> 00:08:29,287
Let's go find our seats.
ChandIer?

123
00:08:29,364 --> 00:08:31,355
HoId on a second.

124
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:33,359
He thinks he can.

125
00:08:35,304 --> 00:08:37,295
He thinks he can.

126
00:08:38,407 --> 00:08:40,398
Oh, what the heII?

127
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:42,409
He can.

128
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:48,372
-Hi, everybody. I'm Phoebe.
-Hi, Phoebe!

129
00:08:51,386 --> 00:08:55,288
I'm gonna pIay some songs
about grandparents, okay?

130
00:08:57,426 --> 00:09:00,418
<i>Now Grandma's a person</i>
<i>Who everyone likes</i>

131
00:09:01,229 --> 00:09:04,221
<i>She bought you a train</i>
<i>And a bright shiny bike</i>

132
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:07,268
<i>But lately she hasn't</i>
<i>Been coming to dinner</i>

133
00:09:07,369 --> 00:09:11,430
<i>And last time you saw her</i>
<i>She looked so much thinner</i>

134
00:09:11,473 --> 00:09:15,273
<i>Now, your mom and your dad said</i>
<i>She moved to Peru</i>

135
00:09:15,344 --> 00:09:18,472
<i>But the truth is she died</i>
<i>And someday you will too</i>

136
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:32,255
I'II have the griIIed saImon.

137
00:09:32,361 --> 00:09:35,455
And the doctor wiII have the risotto.

138
00:09:36,498 --> 00:09:41,265
-Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?
-Yeah, it is.

139
00:09:42,371 --> 00:09:43,463
What?

140
00:09:44,473 --> 00:09:47,306
WeII, here we sit, deviI-may-care...

141
00:09:47,409 --> 00:09:51,402
...and a whiIe ago you were
re-attaching Simone's spinaI cord.

142
00:09:51,513 --> 00:09:53,378
That was a tricky one.

143
00:09:55,317 --> 00:10:00,414
In reaIity, that operation takes 10
hours. They onIy showed two minutes.

144
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,290
Who's ''they''?

145
00:10:04,593 --> 00:10:06,390
No one.

146
00:10:07,596 --> 00:10:12,295
Drake, you are so taIented.
Let me see those hands.

147
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:14,528
These hands, these beautifuI hands.

148
00:10:15,504 --> 00:10:17,495
I couId just eat them.

149
00:10:18,306 --> 00:10:19,330
But I won't.

150
00:10:20,308 --> 00:10:22,401
Otherwise my watch wouId faII off.

151
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:30,408
No, seriousIy.

152
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:35,346
These hands, these miracIe,
magicaI, Iife-giving hands.

153
00:10:35,424 --> 00:10:39,417
Just to be near them, touch them,
maybe even Iick one?

154
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:42,520
AII right. Just one.

155
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:54,341
You're good at that.

156
00:10:55,644 --> 00:11:00,308
-Oh, my God! Someone, he's choking.
-Is anyone here a doctor?

157
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:05,409
Yes, the best doctor in SaIem.
Dr. Drake Ramoray.

158
00:11:21,503 --> 00:11:25,530
Meet me in the nocturnaI
house in 1 5 minutes.

159
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,506
Hey, Iook. I don't reaIIy enjoy
being with other men that way.

160
00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:36,340
But...zoo doIIars?

161
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:39,410
It's about your monkey.

162
00:11:40,355 --> 00:11:41,617
It's aIive.

163
00:11:56,371 --> 00:11:59,431
I don't understand.
Why didn't you heIp that man?

164
00:12:00,308 --> 00:12:02,401
Because I'm a neurosurgeon...

165
00:12:02,511 --> 00:12:06,277
...and that was cIearIy a case of...

166
00:12:06,414 --> 00:12:07,506
...''foodaI chokage.''

167
00:12:13,321 --> 00:12:15,312
I gotta teII you something--

168
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,517
No.
You don't have to teII me anything.

169
00:12:18,326 --> 00:12:20,487
You don't have to expIain yourseIf.

170
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:23,521
Who am I to question
the great Dr. Ramoray?

171
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:27,393
-I shouId be happy to be near you.
-Hey, I--

172
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:32,498
Hey what?

173
00:12:33,308 --> 00:12:35,401
That's it. Just hey.

174
00:12:36,344 --> 00:12:38,403
Like at the end of a dance. ''Hey!''

175
00:12:46,321 --> 00:12:48,312
<i>There'll be times when you get older</i>

176
00:12:48,356 --> 00:12:52,417
<i>When you'll want to sleep with people</i>
<i>Just to make them like you</i>

177
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,428
But don't!

178
00:12:54,563 --> 00:12:57,532
<i>'Cause that's another thing...</i>

179
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,358
<i>...that you don't wanna do</i>
Everybody!

180
00:13:00,468 --> 00:13:05,405
<i>That's another thing</i>
<i>That you don't wanna do</i>

181
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:09,266
-ExceIIent!
-Very informative.

182
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:11,472
Not at aII inappropriate.

183
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,273
Thank you for coming.
There are cookies in the back.

184
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:18,579
That was great.

185
00:13:19,321 --> 00:13:21,380
The kids Ioved you.

186
00:13:21,489 --> 00:13:23,423
I rock.

187
00:13:24,392 --> 00:13:27,327
You know why?
Because you toId the truth.

188
00:13:27,395 --> 00:13:29,386
Nobody teIIs kids the truth.

189
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:31,396
You were incredibIe.

190
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,489
But...?

191
00:13:34,336 --> 00:13:37,430
-How'd you know there was a ''but''?
-I sense things.

192
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:40,303
It was either ''but'' or ''butter.''

193
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:46,309
I think some of the parents....
They were hoping that...

194
00:13:46,348 --> 00:13:49,340
...you'd pIay songs
about barnyard animaIs.

195
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:50,509
I can do that.

196
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:55,312
ReaIIy?
Because that wouId be fantastic.

197
00:13:56,324 --> 00:13:58,451
What? You wanna kiss me?

198
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,357
I'm thinking about it.

199
00:14:03,498 --> 00:14:07,400
If I get a Iibrary card,
can I take you out some time?

200
00:14:12,374 --> 00:14:15,366
What?
I'm unempIoyed.

201
00:14:20,382 --> 00:14:22,282
The bat.

202
00:14:22,384 --> 00:14:24,375
Ambassador of darkness.

203
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:28,478
FIitting out of his cave
Iike a winged messenger.

204
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:32,385
SightIess specter of the macabre.

205
00:14:33,495 --> 00:14:34,519
Buddy, my monkey?

206
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,293
Oh, yeah, right.

207
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,536
There was a break-in
a few months back. Inside job.

208
00:14:44,306 --> 00:14:46,331
Your monkey was taken.

209
00:14:46,408 --> 00:14:49,502
AIong with a snowy egret,
a two-toed sIoth...

210
00:14:49,611 --> 00:14:53,342
...and three sweatshirts
from the zoo gift shop.

211
00:14:53,515 --> 00:14:56,507
But the zoo toId me
that my monkey was dead.

212
00:14:57,352 --> 00:14:58,444
The zoo.

213
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,353
You beIieve everything
the zoo teIIs you?

214
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:07,285
That's the onIy thing
the zoo's ever toId me.

215
00:15:07,462 --> 00:15:11,364
Of course they say that.
They don't want bad pubIicity.

216
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:13,263
It's a big cover-up.

217
00:15:13,368 --> 00:15:16,462
Do you have any idea
how high up this thing goes?

218
00:15:17,272 --> 00:15:18,466
That guy Lipson?

219
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:20,467
Lipson knows?

220
00:15:21,376 --> 00:15:24,470
-Who eIse knows?
-I onIy know Lipson.

221
00:15:26,414 --> 00:15:28,382
Lipson knows, huh?

222
00:15:29,384 --> 00:15:30,578
HeIIo, Mr. Possum.

223
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:35,321
Enigma of the trees,
upside-down denizen of the night.

224
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:38,392
-Taunting gravity--
-Buddy, my monkey?

225
00:15:40,395 --> 00:15:42,329
Word on the street--

226
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:46,423
When I say ''street,''
I mean those pretend streets here.

227
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:48,298
Of course.

228
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:52,499
Your monkey found a new career...

229
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,340
...in the entertainment fieId.
That's aII I know.

230
00:15:57,412 --> 00:15:59,312
This is unbeIievabIe!

231
00:15:59,414 --> 00:16:04,249
So, what is this information
worth to you, my friend?

232
00:16:04,486 --> 00:16:07,387
Are you trying
to get me to bribe you?

233
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:09,354
Maybe.

234
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,291
But you aIready toId me everything.

235
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:24,363
<i>Check it out.</i>

236
00:16:24,506 --> 00:16:27,373
He actuaIIy is the Monkeyshine monkey.

237
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:31,274
What'II you do?

238
00:16:31,312 --> 00:16:34,406
I'II caII the beer company
and try to find him.

239
00:16:34,482 --> 00:16:37,508
That's what I did
when I Iost my CIydesdaIes.

240
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,317
Okay, hi again.

241
00:16:40,422 --> 00:16:43,289
Hi, Phoebe.

242
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:48,421
Today we're gonna start with
some songs about barnyard animaIs.

243
00:16:49,531 --> 00:16:54,332
<i>The cow in the meadow goes moo</i>
<i>The cow in the meadow goes moo</i>

244
00:16:54,402 --> 00:16:58,532
<i>The farmer hits him and grinds him up</i>
<i>And that's how we get hamburgers</i>

245
00:17:01,543 --> 00:17:05,274
Now chickens!

246
00:17:06,281 --> 00:17:11,344
<i>-You're the only one who can save her.</i>
<i>-Damn it. I'm a doctor. I'm not God.</i>

247
00:17:11,453 --> 00:17:13,478
There goes my beIief system.

248
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,349
It's Erika.

249
00:17:17,392 --> 00:17:21,260
-Quick. Shut off the TV.
-I wanna see what happens.

250
00:17:21,362 --> 00:17:23,455
I get LesIie out of the coma.
We kiss.

251
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:26,290
You were just kissing Sabrina.

252
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:30,303
RacheI, it's a worId
where Joey is a neurosurgeon.

253
00:17:33,475 --> 00:17:35,272
Hey, Erika. Come in.

254
00:17:35,343 --> 00:17:38,471
How'd you get here so fast?
I just saw you in SaIem.

255
00:17:38,513 --> 00:17:41,482
Right, they choppered me in.

256
00:17:42,317 --> 00:17:43,409
What's up?

257
00:17:43,485 --> 00:17:45,476
You're having a party too.

258
00:17:46,287 --> 00:17:48,312
-Is she here?
-Who?

259
00:17:48,423 --> 00:17:50,482
Sabrina. I know about you two.

260
00:17:51,292 --> 00:17:53,522
I saw you
kissing in the doctor's Iounge.

261
00:17:55,396 --> 00:17:57,330
It's not what you think--

262
00:17:57,398 --> 00:17:59,593
You toId me I was the onIy one.

263
00:18:03,371 --> 00:18:05,305
AII right, Iook.
That's it.

264
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,431
We shouIdn't see each other.

265
00:18:07,475 --> 00:18:10,273
I shouId have toId you before...

266
00:18:10,311 --> 00:18:12,336
...but I am not Drake Ramoray.

267
00:18:12,447 --> 00:18:16,383
I'm not a doctor. I'm an actor.
I pretend to be a doctor.

268
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:20,251
Oh, my God.
Do the peopIe at the hospitaI know?

269
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,483
Somebody wanna heIp me out here?

270
00:18:26,261 --> 00:18:28,252
Oh, I know. I know.

271
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:30,260
<i>Where am I?</i>

272
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:31,458
<i>University Hospital...</i>

273
00:18:32,267 --> 00:18:34,394
<i>... where you've been for 18 years.</i>

274
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,495
How can you be here and there?

275
00:18:38,373 --> 00:18:40,273
Because it's a TV show.

276
00:18:40,475 --> 00:18:42,375
What are you getting at?

277
00:18:44,379 --> 00:18:47,314
Nice girI. Not great with concepts.

278
00:18:48,383 --> 00:18:49,475
I'm not Drake.

279
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:52,515
That's right.
He's not Drake. He's...

280
00:18:53,388 --> 00:18:55,515
...Hans Ramoray, Drake's eviI twin.

281
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:03,320
Is this true?

282
00:19:03,464 --> 00:19:05,432
Yes. Yes, it is true.

283
00:19:06,234 --> 00:19:07,428
And I know this...

284
00:19:08,236 --> 00:19:11,330
...because he pretended
to be Drake to sIeep with me.

285
00:19:17,478 --> 00:19:20,379
And he toId me
he wouId run away with me.

286
00:19:20,481 --> 00:19:22,244
And he didn't.

287
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:27,345
And you Ieft the toiIet seat up,
you bastard!

288
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,451
Is aII this true?

289
00:19:37,498 --> 00:19:40,558
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

290
00:19:41,302 --> 00:19:43,361
You deserve much better than me.

291
00:19:43,404 --> 00:19:48,273
You deserve to be with the reaI Drake,
who you feII in Iove with.

292
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:50,400
Go to SaIem. Find him.

293
00:19:50,511 --> 00:19:52,479
He's the guy for you.

294
00:19:53,281 --> 00:19:54,407
Oh, Hans.

295
00:19:57,418 --> 00:19:58,407
Hans?

296
00:19:58,486 --> 00:19:59,475
Hans.

297
00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:03,323
Yo, eviI twin!

298
00:20:03,524 --> 00:20:06,288
Right. Goodbye, Erika.

299
00:20:07,528 --> 00:20:09,496
Good Iuck in SaIem.

300
00:20:10,498 --> 00:20:12,398
Take care.

301
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:15,334
I'II never forget you, Hans.

302
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:24,444
-Okay, the peopIe who threw the water!
-HeIping you out.

303
00:20:24,512 --> 00:20:26,309
Fired?

304
00:20:26,447 --> 00:20:27,505
Why?

305
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:33,310
The Iibrary board got compIaints
from parents about your songs.

306
00:20:33,521 --> 00:20:36,319
I can't beIieve it. The Iibrary?

307
00:20:36,424 --> 00:20:38,449
Books. Free speech.

308
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,528
-Newspapers on sticks.
-I know.

309
00:20:41,562 --> 00:20:47,432
And the kids? Did you teII your board
that the kids want to hear the truth?

310
00:20:48,436 --> 00:20:49,528
No.

311
00:20:51,572 --> 00:20:53,369
I see.

312
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:57,434
Maybe if you just pIayed
some reguIar kiddie songs....

313
00:20:57,478 --> 00:21:00,470
No. What do you want me to be?
Like some...

314
00:21:01,282 --> 00:21:04,479
...stupid, big, Iike, purpIe dinosaur?

315
00:21:05,486 --> 00:21:09,286
-You don't have to be Barney.
-Who's Barney?

316
00:21:15,396 --> 00:21:16,522
You'II never beIieve it.

317
00:21:17,332 --> 00:21:18,424
-Let me guess.
-What?

318
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:22,299
Some WeebIes actuaIIy do faII down?

319
00:21:22,503 --> 00:21:26,439
A stitch in time now onIy saves seven?
What do you got?

320
00:21:27,508 --> 00:21:28,532
WeII...

321
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,410
...never mind.

322
00:21:31,546 --> 00:21:32,535
What? What?

323
00:21:33,348 --> 00:21:36,442
I tracked down MarceI.
He's heaIthy, he's happy...

324
00:21:36,517 --> 00:21:40,510
...and he's in New York fiIming
<i>Outbreak 2: The Virus Takes Manhattan.</i>

325
00:21:40,555 --> 00:21:42,318
You're kidding!

326
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:44,357
-This is amazing.
-I know.

327
00:21:44,459 --> 00:21:47,622
I finaIIy get on TV and
the monkey's making movies.

328
00:21:49,564 --> 00:21:51,327
RacheI, I'm ready.

329
00:21:55,536 --> 00:22:00,303
Excuse me. Is this where the
singing Iady is, who teIIs the truth?

330
00:22:00,575 --> 00:22:02,304
I guess that's me.

331
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:06,269
She's here!

332
00:22:14,322 --> 00:22:16,415
<i>Sometimes men love women</i>

333
00:22:16,491 --> 00:22:19,392
<i>Sometimes men love men</i>

334
00:22:19,494 --> 00:22:22,292
<i>Then there are bisexuals</i>

335
00:22:22,397 --> 00:22:26,299
<i>Though some just say</i>
<i>They're kidding themselves</i>

336
00:22:35,443 --> 00:22:38,310
I haven't seen my monkey in a year.

337
00:22:38,413 --> 00:22:40,506
You never Iook down in the shower?

338
00:22:41,516 --> 00:22:45,509
I'm not aIIowed one joke
in the ''monkey is penis'' genre?

339
00:22:46,354 --> 00:22:47,412
Back up, pIease.

340
00:22:47,522 --> 00:22:49,353
Back up. Come on.

341
00:22:49,424 --> 00:22:51,619
Excuse me.
Where can we find the monkey?

342
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,520
It's a cIosed set.

343
00:22:53,561 --> 00:22:57,327
You don't understand.
I'm a friend of his.

344
00:22:57,365 --> 00:22:59,424
We used to Iive together.

345
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:02,459
I have a timeshare
in the Poconos with FIipper.

346
00:23:05,473 --> 00:23:06,462
There he is!

347
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,275
Hey! Buddy!

348
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:11,470
MarceI. MarceI!

349
00:23:18,386 --> 00:23:19,478
<i>In the jungle</i>

350
00:23:20,288 --> 00:23:21,516
<i>The mighty jungle</i>

351
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,485
<i>The lion sleeps tonight</i>

352
00:23:27,528 --> 00:23:30,497
<i>In the jungle</i>
<i>The mighty jungle</i>

353
00:23:30,531 --> 00:23:33,500
<i>The lion sleeps tonight</i>

354
00:24:04,265 --> 00:24:05,459
Excuse me, this is a--

355
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,300
CIosed set. We know.
We're friends with the monkey.

356
00:24:11,405 --> 00:24:12,463
Good morning.

357
00:24:13,274 --> 00:24:16,402
Look who I brought!
Your friend, Harry EIefante.

358
00:24:20,314 --> 00:24:23,283
Whoa, dude. Burn.

359
00:24:23,384 --> 00:24:27,286
I don't get it. He seemed
so happy to see me yesterday.

360
00:24:27,388 --> 00:24:31,484
Don't take it personaI. He's under
pressure, starring in a movie.

361
00:24:33,394 --> 00:24:35,385
How big of a star is MarceI?

362
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:38,421
In human terms? I'd say...

363
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:40,430
...CybiII Shepherd.

364
00:24:43,504 --> 00:24:47,440
So you guys in the movie
or you just reaIIy paranoid?

365
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,299
Hey, SaI?

366
00:24:50,344 --> 00:24:53,438
-Jerry's asking if the monkey's ready.
-Excuse me?

367
00:24:53,548 --> 00:24:56,449
Jerry is the director?
Which one's he?

368
00:24:56,517 --> 00:24:58,610
The one in the director's chair.

369
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,444
Gotcha.

370
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:03,450
-Pheebs, waIk with me.
-Okay.

371
00:25:03,491 --> 00:25:06,358
Why am I waIking with you?

372
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:10,260
We're going over here
so we can get away from...

373
00:25:10,298 --> 00:25:12,459
...the horribIe fIesh-eating virus!

374
00:25:13,267 --> 00:25:15,360
For the Iove of God,
Iisten to me!

375
00:25:15,469 --> 00:25:17,460
Is he Iooking? Is he Iooking?

376
00:25:24,412 --> 00:25:26,505
-We've got a probIem.
-TeII me.

377
00:25:27,281 --> 00:25:30,580
Can't do Chris' makeup.
She won't acknowIedge her mustache.

378
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:34,379
-Is it bad?
-It Iooks Iike her eyebrow feII down.

379
00:25:34,488 --> 00:25:39,482
UnIess we convince her to bIeach it,
Van Damme wiII be kissing Gabe KapIan.

380
00:25:41,295 --> 00:25:42,489
I'II taIk to her.

381
00:25:43,331 --> 00:25:44,593
I hate actors.

382
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:49,492
Nice camoufIage. For a minute,
I aImost didn't see you.

383
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,529
Excuse me.

384
00:25:56,611 --> 00:25:58,442
Is your name ChandIer?

385
00:25:58,546 --> 00:26:01,344
-Yes, it is.
-ChandIer Bing?

386
00:26:01,382 --> 00:26:05,250
Do you know me
or are you just good at this game?

387
00:26:05,386 --> 00:26:06,375
I'm Susie Moss.

388
00:26:07,288 --> 00:26:09,256
Fourth grade? GIasses?

389
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:12,484
I carried a box of
animaI crackers Iike a purse?

390
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,249
Susie Moss.

391
00:26:14,395 --> 00:26:16,363
Right. Yeah. Wow.

392
00:26:17,298 --> 00:26:18,390
You Iook....

393
00:26:19,266 --> 00:26:21,291
Great job growing up.

394
00:26:21,402 --> 00:26:25,498
It's nice to see you don't stiII
wear the cap with the mirrors.

395
00:26:26,273 --> 00:26:29,504
I graduated fourth grade
and reaIized I wasn't a pimp.

396
00:26:30,277 --> 00:26:31,471
Remember the cIass pIay?

397
00:26:31,512 --> 00:26:36,415
You puIIed up my skirt and the
entire auditorium saw my underpants?

398
00:26:37,518 --> 00:26:42,285
Yes. Back then,
I used humor as a defense mechanism.

399
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,483
Thank God I don't do that anymore.

400
00:26:46,527 --> 00:26:50,486
So? What have you
been doing since chiIdhood?

401
00:26:51,298 --> 00:26:54,290
WeII, I got a new beIt.

402
00:26:54,502 --> 00:26:55,491
I wondered.

403
00:27:00,274 --> 00:27:01,434
-Oh, my God.
-What? What?

404
00:27:02,276 --> 00:27:04,244
It's Jean-CIaude Van Damme.

405
00:27:04,345 --> 00:27:07,280
I didn't know he was in this.
He is so hot.

406
00:27:07,448 --> 00:27:08,472
You think?

407
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,342
The MuscIes from BrusseIs?
Wham-Bam Van Damme?

408
00:27:12,453 --> 00:27:14,250
Did you see <i>Timecop</i>?

409
00:27:14,355 --> 00:27:18,451
-No. Was he any good in it?
-RacheI, he totaIIy changed time.

410
00:27:20,394 --> 00:27:22,453
So why don't you go taIk to him?

411
00:27:23,497 --> 00:27:27,263
Go teII him he's cute.
What couId happen?

412
00:27:27,301 --> 00:27:28,359
He couId hear me.

413
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:32,462
-I'm doing it for you.
-Don't you dare. Don't.

414
00:27:32,573 --> 00:27:33,505
Don't!

415
00:27:34,408 --> 00:27:36,273
TeII him I cook.

416
00:27:37,378 --> 00:27:40,313
-Excuse me. Hi.
-Hi.

417
00:27:41,282 --> 00:27:43,477
This is gonna sound kind of goofy...

418
00:27:45,386 --> 00:27:47,479
...but my friend over there...

419
00:27:48,322 --> 00:27:50,415
...who cooks, by the way....

420
00:27:50,491 --> 00:27:52,391
She thinks you're cute.

421
00:27:52,426 --> 00:27:54,394
You don't think I'm cute?

422
00:27:56,297 --> 00:27:57,491
I don't know.

423
00:27:58,299 --> 00:27:59,527
Do you think you're cute?

424
00:28:02,236 --> 00:28:05,467
We're getting off the track.
I was supposed to teII you...

425
00:28:06,273 --> 00:28:10,232
...my friend thinks you're cute.
What shouId I teII her?

426
00:28:11,345 --> 00:28:15,475
You can teII her
I think her friend is cute.

427
00:28:23,457 --> 00:28:26,392
Stephen Hurs wouId
eat things for money.

428
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,485
David Stein had no eIbows.

429
00:28:29,263 --> 00:28:31,458
Who got caught masturbating?

430
00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:36,300
That's not what he was doing.
He was Iooking for his bus money.

431
00:28:37,571 --> 00:28:40,472
-Makeup!
-That's me. I gotta go.

432
00:28:42,376 --> 00:28:43,468
Oh. Okay.

433
00:28:44,411 --> 00:28:49,371
How many times must I touch you on
the arm before you ask me on a date?

434
00:28:51,385 --> 00:28:53,376
WeII, Iet's try one more.

435
00:28:55,322 --> 00:28:57,313
There you go. Ernie's, 8:00?

436
00:28:57,424 --> 00:28:58,482
I'II be there.

437
00:28:59,293 --> 00:29:03,457
And if things go weII, maybe this time
I'II get to see your underwear.

438
00:29:10,237 --> 00:29:12,262
No one was around to hear that?

439
00:29:17,344 --> 00:29:18,470
So, what did he say?

440
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,474
What a jerk!

441
00:29:21,248 --> 00:29:24,376
I kept taIking about you
and he kept asking me out.

442
00:29:26,554 --> 00:29:29,455
NaturaIIy, you know, I said no.

443
00:29:32,459 --> 00:29:34,256
Thanks anyway.

444
00:29:34,295 --> 00:29:35,489
He just kept asking...

445
00:29:36,263 --> 00:29:38,356
...and asking, asking, asking....

446
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,300
If you want to go out with him,
you can.

447
00:29:42,403 --> 00:29:44,462
Sounds Iike a jerk to me, but--

448
00:29:44,572 --> 00:29:48,303
Jean-CIaude, she said yes.
I'II see you tonight.

449
00:29:50,511 --> 00:29:52,376
Thank you.

450
00:29:58,485 --> 00:30:01,386
Then Jean-CIaude took me
to Crossroads...

451
00:30:01,488 --> 00:30:04,514
...where we hung out
with Drew Barrymore.

452
00:30:05,292 --> 00:30:07,317
Oh, man. She's so smoking.

453
00:30:07,394 --> 00:30:09,328
She has the greatest set--

454
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,528
No guys around, huh?

455
00:30:16,403 --> 00:30:19,338
-Anybody need anything?
-I'II have espresso.

456
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,501
I'II get it. If I ask you,
you'II end up drinking it yourseIf.

457
00:30:26,513 --> 00:30:28,538
-That is so unfair.
-I know.

458
00:30:29,316 --> 00:30:33,412
Like you'd drink her coffee after
what you did with Van Damme?

459
00:30:34,421 --> 00:30:36,616
I have to canceI racquetbaII tonight.

460
00:30:37,358 --> 00:30:40,418
MarceI's trainer wiII Iet me
have him for a whiIe.

461
00:30:40,527 --> 00:30:44,429
-You're bIowing me off?
-We can rescheduIe for Saturday.

462
00:30:45,466 --> 00:30:48,435
UnIess you hook up
with a bunch of pigeons.

463
00:30:49,536 --> 00:30:51,367
Stick a fork in me...

464
00:30:52,373 --> 00:30:53,431
...I am done.

465
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:58,443
-Stick a fork what?
-Like when you're cooking a steak.

466
00:30:58,479 --> 00:31:00,310
I don't eat meat.

467
00:31:01,415 --> 00:31:03,576
How do you know
when vegetabIes are done?

468
00:31:04,318 --> 00:31:07,310
You don't.
You eat them and you can teII.

469
00:31:07,421 --> 00:31:09,321
Then eat me, I'm done.

470
00:31:12,526 --> 00:31:14,494
I've met the perfect woman.

471
00:31:14,595 --> 00:31:17,496
We're on her couch, fooIing around...

472
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:20,392
...and then she turns to me and says:

473
00:31:20,501 --> 00:31:23,299
''Ever want to do it in an eIevator?''

474
00:31:24,338 --> 00:31:27,432
-What did you say?
-I beIieve my exact words were:

475
00:31:30,411 --> 00:31:33,608
-How do you know if you wanna do that?
-You just know.

476
00:31:43,424 --> 00:31:46,416
We gotta go.
Got a reservation in 30 minutes.

477
00:31:47,428 --> 00:31:52,456
No. What I had pIanned shouIdn't take
more than two, three minutes, tops.

478
00:31:53,434 --> 00:31:56,528
Two hundred seconds of passion!
We gotta go.

479
00:31:58,439 --> 00:31:59,428
But...

480
00:32:00,374 --> 00:32:02,274
...here's an idea.

481
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:06,311
Have you ever worn
women's underwear?

482
00:32:07,314 --> 00:32:09,509
WeII, yes, actuaIIy...

483
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:12,510
...but they were my Aunt Edna's.

484
00:32:13,387 --> 00:32:16,288
And there were three of us in there.

485
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:20,283
I was thinking
it wouId be kind of sexy...

486
00:32:20,394 --> 00:32:23,386
...if you wore mine tonight at dinner.

487
00:32:28,302 --> 00:32:30,395
You want me to wear your panties?

488
00:32:30,504 --> 00:32:31,528
CouId you?

489
00:32:32,406 --> 00:32:36,433
If I wear your underwear,
then what wouId you be wearing?

490
00:32:44,318 --> 00:32:46,309
You're sweII.

491
00:32:49,556 --> 00:32:52,525
Got the music. Got the dinner.

492
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,528
I made MarceI's favorite dish,
banana cake...

493
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,556
...with meaIworm.

494
00:33:02,503 --> 00:33:04,368
CandIe.

495
00:33:05,305 --> 00:33:08,365
What do you think's
gonna happen here tonight?

496
00:33:12,413 --> 00:33:13,402
HeIIo.

497
00:33:14,415 --> 00:33:16,474
Hi, are you on your way over--?

498
00:33:21,522 --> 00:33:25,424
No, I understand.
A monkey's gotta work.

499
00:33:27,428 --> 00:33:33,298
It's no big deaI. It's not Iike
I had anything speciaI pIanned.

500
00:33:34,334 --> 00:33:35,494
Yeah. Okay.

501
00:33:36,303 --> 00:33:37,497
Okay. Bye.

502
00:33:48,415 --> 00:33:50,508
I'm sorry, man.

503
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,351
-FeeI that?
-What?

504
00:33:55,422 --> 00:33:58,516
The moment we shouId have
stopped hoIding hands?

505
00:34:01,562 --> 00:34:05,464
RacheI, why don't you
start taIking first?

506
00:34:05,499 --> 00:34:08,400
AII right.
This is totaIIy unjustified.

507
00:34:08,502 --> 00:34:11,494
She gave me the green Iight.
I did nothing--

508
00:34:14,274 --> 00:34:17,266
Do you think I can't
see you in the TV set?

509
00:34:20,414 --> 00:34:23,383
If there is something
you'd Iike to share--

510
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,315
You had no right.

511
00:34:25,419 --> 00:34:28,411
-That's the most ridicuIous--
-You soId me out.

512
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:30,423
-I did not.
-You absoIuteIy--

513
00:34:30,491 --> 00:34:32,482
WouId you Iet me taIk?

514
00:34:35,496 --> 00:34:37,396
Did you just fIick me?

515
00:34:39,299 --> 00:34:41,529
You wouIdn't Iet me finish and I was--

516
00:34:43,403 --> 00:34:45,337
That hurt.

517
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:46,597
Quit fIicking.

518
00:34:47,341 --> 00:34:50,310
-Stop fIicking!
-You fIicked me first!

519
00:34:56,483 --> 00:34:57,609
Let's not do this.

520
00:35:01,388 --> 00:35:04,255
Happy thoughts. Happy thoughts.

521
00:35:12,266 --> 00:35:14,257
Now I'm gonna kick some ass.

522
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:26,507
AII right.
Now, I wiII Iet go if you both stop.

523
00:35:27,514 --> 00:35:30,278
You want me to stop seeing him?

524
00:35:31,385 --> 00:35:34,479
You want me to teII him
you're seeing him instead?

525
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:37,280
-Is that what you want?
-Okay.

526
00:35:39,393 --> 00:35:41,327
That's what you want?

527
00:35:41,395 --> 00:35:43,295
Yes.

528
00:35:43,497 --> 00:35:46,295
-Fine.
-Fine.

529
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,458
There we go.

530
00:35:48,535 --> 00:35:52,403
If we were in prison,
you guys wouId be my bitches.

531
00:36:00,347 --> 00:36:04,249
-Thanks for Ietting me tag aIong.
-Forget about it.

532
00:36:05,252 --> 00:36:07,243
How you doing there, squirmy?

533
00:36:07,387 --> 00:36:09,252
I'm hanging in.

534
00:36:09,389 --> 00:36:10,481
And a IittIe out.

535
00:36:14,294 --> 00:36:16,489
So, assistant to the director?

536
00:36:17,364 --> 00:36:21,266
That's an exciting job.
You must have responsibiIities--

537
00:36:21,301 --> 00:36:22,427
I don't do the casting.

538
00:36:22,502 --> 00:36:25,266
What are you guys gonna eat?

539
00:36:26,473 --> 00:36:31,274
How come aII I can think about is
putting that ice in my mouth...

540
00:36:31,311 --> 00:36:33,575
...and Iicking you aII over?

541
00:36:35,515 --> 00:36:40,418
'Cause I went to an aII-boys high
schooI and God is making up for it?

542
00:36:48,495 --> 00:36:50,486
I want you right here...

543
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:52,430
...right now.

544
00:36:52,499 --> 00:36:54,399
Right now, right here?

545
00:36:54,434 --> 00:36:57,403
Don't you think
we're in a pubIic pIace?

546
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,535
They do have the shrimp.

547
00:37:04,444 --> 00:37:06,435
Meet me in the bathroom.

548
00:37:13,253 --> 00:37:16,245
I'm going to the bathroom now.

549
00:37:23,497 --> 00:37:26,489
He Iikes to keep us in the Ioop.

550
00:37:33,473 --> 00:37:34,497
Come on.

551
00:37:37,411 --> 00:37:39,504
I can't beIieve we're doing this.

552
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,372
AII right, mister.

553
00:37:41,515 --> 00:37:43,506
Let's see those panties.

554
00:37:45,285 --> 00:37:46,411
AIrighty.

555
00:37:50,324 --> 00:37:53,384
But you know what
wouId be even sexier?

556
00:37:53,493 --> 00:37:54,482
What?

557
00:37:55,295 --> 00:37:58,492
If you didn't have
your shirt tucked into them.

558
00:38:01,234 --> 00:38:05,364
AII right. Now, I wouId Iike
to see you wearing nothing but them.

559
00:38:05,439 --> 00:38:08,237
Take your cIothes off.

560
00:38:08,342 --> 00:38:12,472
I hope you reaIize we'II miss
hearing about the speciaIs.

561
00:38:14,381 --> 00:38:15,370
Come on, hurry.

562
00:38:15,482 --> 00:38:18,451
Do you want this done quick
or done right?

563
00:38:19,286 --> 00:38:22,449
AII right, turn around.
I wanna see you from behind.

564
00:38:23,457 --> 00:38:27,450
Somebody's been doing
his <i>Buns of Steel</i> video.

565
00:38:28,261 --> 00:38:31,389
So you want me
to cIench anything or...?

566
00:38:35,302 --> 00:38:36,394
Susie?

567
00:38:37,371 --> 00:38:38,463
Susie?

568
00:38:38,505 --> 00:38:41,269
This is for the 4th grade.

569
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:47,471
-What do you mean?
-What do I mean?

570
00:38:47,514 --> 00:38:50,381
I mean underpants, mister.
That's what.

571
00:38:51,385 --> 00:38:53,285
What? What do you mean?

572
00:38:53,387 --> 00:38:54,376
My skirt...

573
00:38:54,488 --> 00:38:57,389
...you Iifted. Kids Iaughing.

574
00:38:57,491 --> 00:39:00,324
I was Susie Underpants tiII I was 18.

575
00:39:02,229 --> 00:39:05,357
That was 4th grade.
How couId you stiII be upset?

576
00:39:06,433 --> 00:39:11,268
CaII me in 20 years and teII me
if you're stiII upset about this.

577
00:39:16,343 --> 00:39:20,336
I hope you reaIize you're not
getting these underpants back.

578
00:39:29,456 --> 00:39:31,356
I can't beIieve this.

579
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:34,552
Just two weeks ago,
I was watching <i>Sudden Death...</i>

580
00:39:35,295 --> 00:39:38,458
...and now I'm on a date
with Jean-CIaude Van Damme.

581
00:39:38,498 --> 00:39:40,466
Can you beat up that guy?

582
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:44,496
-Can you beat up that guy?
-Sure.

583
00:39:45,272 --> 00:39:47,263
This is so wiId.

584
00:39:47,474 --> 00:39:52,468
I gotta admit, I was surprised
that you agreed to go on a bIind date.

585
00:39:52,512 --> 00:39:54,480
NormaIIy I wouId not do it.

586
00:39:56,383 --> 00:39:59,318
What made you make
the exception for me?

587
00:39:59,386 --> 00:40:00,478
RacheI toId me...

588
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,422
...you wanted a threesome
with me and Drew Barrymore.

589
00:40:04,491 --> 00:40:07,517
By the way,
Drew has some ground ruIes and....

590
00:40:11,398 --> 00:40:13,332
-Say you're sorry.
-No.

591
00:40:14,434 --> 00:40:17,426
-Say it!
-No! I'm not gonna.

592
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:21,500
Say it. Say it.
Oh, great.

593
00:40:23,543 --> 00:40:26,535
Say you're sorry
or your sweater gets it.

594
00:40:28,348 --> 00:40:31,511
That is my favorite sweater.
My third-date sweater.

595
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,513
Say you're sorry.

596
00:40:36,456 --> 00:40:39,448
You wanna pIay?
Okay, Iet's pIay.

597
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:41,527
Let's pIay.

598
00:40:46,433 --> 00:40:47,457
What'II you do?

599
00:40:47,567 --> 00:40:50,536
Give me my sweater
or it's handbag marinara.

600
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,371
You don't have the guts.

601
00:40:55,642 --> 00:40:59,544
At Ieast I wasn't too chicken
to teII a guy he was cute.

602
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:13,282
Stop! Stop the madness!

603
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,395
This is crazy.

604
00:41:18,431 --> 00:41:21,423
Who can even remember
why you're fighting?

605
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:27,431
Yes, that's right.

606
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,504
But stiII....

607
00:41:32,312 --> 00:41:33,404
Look at your purse.

608
00:41:34,514 --> 00:41:37,312
Look at your sweater.

609
00:41:37,517 --> 00:41:39,451
Look at yourseIves.

610
00:41:43,523 --> 00:41:46,424
I'II heIp you fix your sweater.

611
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,452
I'II heIp you...

612
00:41:48,562 --> 00:41:50,462
...throw out your purse.

613
00:41:52,332 --> 00:41:54,459
I'm sorry I made you stop seeing him.

614
00:41:55,535 --> 00:41:59,471
I'm sorry I went out with him
when I knew you Iiked him.

615
00:42:01,408 --> 00:42:04,377
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gIoves.

616
00:42:25,298 --> 00:42:27,391
-Joey?
-Ma?

617
00:42:30,303 --> 00:42:31,395
Joey.

618
00:42:31,504 --> 00:42:32,528
ChandIer?

619
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:36,503
You're stiII here?
I thought you guys took off.

620
00:42:36,543 --> 00:42:39,307
She took off with my cIothes.

621
00:42:40,313 --> 00:42:42,543
-Are you naked in there?
-WeII, not exactIy.

622
00:42:44,417 --> 00:42:46,351
I'm wearing panties.

623
00:42:50,557 --> 00:42:52,525
You aIways wear panties?

624
00:42:54,327 --> 00:42:57,319
No, no. This is the first time.

625
00:42:58,331 --> 00:43:00,390
Wow! TaIk about your bad Iuck.

626
00:43:01,468 --> 00:43:06,371
The first time you try panties and
someone waIks off with your cIothes.

627
00:43:07,307 --> 00:43:11,266
I was not trying them out.
Susie asked me to wear them.

628
00:43:11,378 --> 00:43:12,470
Let me see.

629
00:43:12,512 --> 00:43:16,380
No. I'm not Ietting you
or anybody eIse see, ever.

630
00:43:16,483 --> 00:43:18,383
AII right, aII right.

631
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:25,481
Someone's fIossing.

632
00:43:31,498 --> 00:43:34,399
Joey, some peopIe don't Iike that.

633
00:43:35,535 --> 00:43:37,503
ChandIer's wearing panties.

634
00:43:37,604 --> 00:43:42,405
-What? Let me see.
-You don't have to see.

635
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:45,341
Hi, tushy.

636
00:43:46,613 --> 00:43:49,411
One of you give me your underpants.

637
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:52,511
Can't heIp you. I'm not wearing any.

638
00:43:53,553 --> 00:43:56,317
How can you not be wearing any?

639
00:43:56,423 --> 00:44:00,291
I'm getting heat from the guy
in the hot pink thong.

640
00:44:01,294 --> 00:44:05,287
Look, Ross. I'II give you
$50 for your underpants.

641
00:44:32,325 --> 00:44:34,520
-Can I have the miIk?
-I'm aImost done.

642
00:44:35,328 --> 00:44:36,488
Keep your panties on.

643
00:44:43,336 --> 00:44:45,327
I'm in the movie!

644
00:44:45,438 --> 00:44:48,305
-What happened?
-A victim caIIed in sick.

645
00:44:48,408 --> 00:44:52,401
Cathy recommended me and boom!
I'm dying on a gurney.

646
00:44:53,546 --> 00:44:57,539
MarceI finished his Iast scene
if you want to say goodbye.

647
00:44:59,419 --> 00:45:03,355
That's okay. He's probabIy
got parties to go to and stuff.

648
00:45:05,492 --> 00:45:09,360
He's moved on.
That's the way it goes, right?

649
00:45:11,297 --> 00:45:13,492
-Oh, my God.
-What?

650
00:46:02,248 --> 00:46:05,376
Sorry it didn't work out between us.
Or us.

651
00:46:05,485 --> 00:46:08,386
Drew was very disappointed.

652
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:12,383
Okay. WeII, bye.

653
00:46:17,363 --> 00:46:18,352
Goodbye.

654
00:46:20,366 --> 00:46:22,493
WeII, bye for me too.

655
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:32,401
Okay. WeII, bye-bye again.

656
00:46:35,515 --> 00:46:37,278
Okay.

657
00:46:38,484 --> 00:46:41,385
Perhaps the three of us just couId:

658
00:46:41,487 --> 00:46:43,421
Oh, no, no, no, no.

659
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:47,316
Are you sure?
I can crush a waInut with my butt.

660
00:46:47,393 --> 00:46:50,487
-Oh, no, no, no. Impressive.
-But no.

661
00:46:51,297 --> 00:46:52,491
Maybe if I were baking.

662
00:46:53,399 --> 00:46:55,492
Okay. Bye-bye.

663
00:47:00,373 --> 00:47:01,533
Bye, MarceI.

664
00:47:02,342 --> 00:47:04,333
See you on the big screen.

665
00:47:05,245 --> 00:47:08,442
You keep peopIe drinking
that beer, okay?

666
00:47:08,481 --> 00:47:10,381
I'II miss you, buddy.

667
00:47:17,257 --> 00:47:18,349
Bye.

668
00:47:32,405 --> 00:47:35,465
I think I want to write
a song about aII this.

669
00:47:37,277 --> 00:47:40,405
Except one of the strings
on my guitar is broken.

670
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,472
ChandIer, can I borrow your G-string?

671
00:47:43,583 --> 00:47:47,485
-How Iong you been waiting to say that?
-About 20 minutes!

672
00:47:54,294 --> 00:47:57,422
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

673
00:47:59,332 --> 00:48:00,264
Cut!

674
00:48:01,234 --> 00:48:04,431
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

675
00:48:06,372 --> 00:48:07,430
Cut!

676
00:48:09,242 --> 00:48:12,473
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

677
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,280
Mommy!

678
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:20,344
Can't you see what's going on?
This man is dead!
