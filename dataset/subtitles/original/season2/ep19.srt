1
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:10,242
Hey, Eddie.

2
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:15,439
-What are you doing here?
-Watching you sIeep.

3
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:19,441
-Why?
-It makes me feeI peacefuI.

4
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:21,351
PIease.

5
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:24,289
-I can't sIeep now!
-You want me to sing?

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,354
That's it. I want you
out of the apartment now!

7
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,388
What are you taIking about?

8
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,490
HannibaI Lecter.

9
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,493
Better roommate than you.

10
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:42,307
You're not fair! One night
you see me and you get scared.

11
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,469
What about the other nights
when you don't see me?

12
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,373
Last night when you got water, I was
nice enough to hide behind the door.

13
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,512
I didn't reaIize that.

14
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,479
Get out now!

15
00:00:57,524 --> 00:01:00,425
-You reaIIy want me out?
-Yes, pIease.

16
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,422
I wanna hear you say
you want me out.

17
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:07,229
-I want you out.
-I wanna hear it from your Iips.

18
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:11,235
Where did you hear it from before?

19
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:15,367
AII right. Consider me gone.
I'II move into my brother's basement.

20
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:19,276
When he finds out,
I'II go find somepIace eIse.

21
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:23,372
I'II be out by the time
you get home from work tomorrow.

22
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:26,479
<i>-Thank you.</i>
-I heard that.

23
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,445
The One Where Eddie Won't Go

24
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,427
-Hey.
-Hey.

25
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,433
WeII, Iook at you!

26
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,233
FinaIIy got that
time machine working, huh?

27
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:28,337
This guy was seIIing them
on 8th Avenue and I thought:

28
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:31,350
-''You know what I don't have?''
-A mirror?

29
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:35,286
Fine, make fun.
I think it's jaunty.

30
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:40,257
For a guy who just Iost his job,
you're in a good mood.

31
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,454
I'II be aII right.
I'm not starting from square one.

32
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:47,489
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray
on <i>Days of our Lives.</i>

33
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:51,361
That's gotta have some kind of cachet.

34
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,372
''Cachet''? ''Jaunty''?

35
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:57,307
ChandIer gave me
word-of-the-day toiIet paper.

36
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,312
I'm gonna get some coffee.

37
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,310
Go on. You know you want to.

38
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,316
-No.
-No?

39
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,421
-Hey.
-Hey.

40
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,424
So? Did you read the book?

41
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,257
Oh, my God.
It was incredibIe.

42
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,427
Didn't it totaIIy speak to you?

43
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,432
-What book?
-You have to read this book.

44
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,441
It's caIIed <i>Be Your Own Wind Keeper.</i>

45
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,337
It's about how women need
to become more empowered.

46
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,472
But there's wind.

47
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,351
And the wind can make us goddesses.

48
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:43,378
But do you know who takes our wind?
Men. They just take it.

49
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,452
Men just take our wind?

50
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,262
AII the time. Because they
are the Iightning-bearers.

51
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,365
Wow.

52
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,394
That sounds kind of cooI.
It's Iike <i>The Hobbit.</i>

53
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,234
It's nothing Iike <i>The Hobbit.</i>

54
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:04,333
It's Iike reading about aII my
reIationships. Except Richard.

55
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:08,312
-Richard wouId never steaI your wind.
-No.

56
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:11,215
-Because he's yummy.
-Yes.

57
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,217
But aII the other ones....

58
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,346
And how they're aIways drinking
from our pooI of inner power.

59
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:22,258
-But God forbid we shouId take a sip.
-Anybody want a cruIIer?

60
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,354
This is a typicaI
Iightning-bearer thing.

61
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:30,368
It's Iike, ''HeIIo. Who wants one
of my phaIIic-shaped man-cakes?''

62
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,269
Who have you been dating?

63
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,444
Don't worry about it.
Things happen.

64
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,483
So you're not mad at me
for getting fired and everything?

65
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,286
Joey, Iook at me.

66
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,294
Look at me!

67
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,203
Do I have Iipstick on my teeth?

68
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,430
No. Can we get back to me?

69
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:13,338
Look, honey. PeopIe get fired
Ieft and right in this business.

70
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,314
I got you an audition
for <i>Another World.</i>

71
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:19,207
AII right.

72
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,412
''Cab Driver Number 2''?

73
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,413
You're weIcome.

74
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,424
But I was Dr. Drake Ramoray.

75
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:30,354
How can I go from
a neurosurgeon to driving a cab?

76
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:36,265
Hey. There was a time when I pIayed
tickIe-pickIe with Rex Harrison.

77
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,331
Things change. RoII with them.

78
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,432
But this is a two-Iine part.

79
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:49,237
It's Iike taking a step backwards.
I'm not gonna do this.

80
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,279
Joey...

81
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:57,345
...I'II teII you the same thing I toId
AI Minser and his pyramid of dogs.

82
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:02,387
Take any job you can get
and don't make on the fIoor.

83
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,388
I'm sorry.

84
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,422
See you.

85
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,393
God!

86
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,228
Oh, God!
I mean, it's just so....

87
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,204
Isn't it?

88
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:18,206
It's Iike reading about my own Iife.

89
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:22,407
This book couId have been caIIed,
''Be Your Own Wind Keeper, RacheI.''

90
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:27,448
It wouIdn't seII a miIIion copies. But
it wouId've made a nice gift for you.

91
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,413
-Hey, you guys.
-Hey.

92
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,520
Sweetie, we've got to go.

93
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,247
No!

94
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,350
No?

95
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:41,366
Why do we aIways have to do everything
according to your timetabIe?

96
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:45,370
ActuaIIy, it's the movie theater
that has the timetabIe.

97
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,338
It's so you don't miss the beginning.

98
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:54,279
This isn't about the movie theater.
This is about you steaIing my wind.

99
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,476
You go, girI!

100
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:04,220
I can't puII that off, can I?

101
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,382
Excuse me, your wind?

102
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,292
Yes, my wind.

103
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:13,388
How do you expect me to grow
if you won't Iet me bIow?

104
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:22,238
You know I don't...

105
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,211
...have a probIem with that.

106
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:41,419
I just reaIIy need to be
with myseIf right now.

107
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,328
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,365
You're right.
I don't have to apoIogize.

109
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,232
Sorry. Damn it!

110
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,342
-What is it?
-I don't know.

111
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:03,178
It's got aII this stuff about wind
and trees and a sacred pooI.

112
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:06,308
I don't get it.
But she's upset about it.

113
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:10,185
This is why I don't date
women who read.

114
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,415
-Uh-oh.
-What's that?

115
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:19,194
It's my Visa biII.
EnveIope one of two.

116
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:24,199
-That can't be good.
-Open it, open it.

117
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,304
Oh, my God.

118
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,234
Look at this.
How did I spend so much money?

119
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:36,404
That's just the minimum amount due.
That's your totaI due.

120
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:41,482
Thirty-five hundred doIIars
at ''PorceIain Safari''?

121
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,314
My animaIs.

122
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:49,417
The guy said they suited me. He spoke
with an accent. I was confused.

123
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,321
What am I gonna do?

124
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,422
Start by driving a cab
on <i>Another World.</i>

125
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,367
-What?
-That audition?

126
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,369
That's a two-Iine part.

127
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:02,407
Joey, you owe $1 100
at ''I Love Lucite.''

128
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:05,267
-So what?
-So suck it up, man.

129
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,278
It's a job. It's money.

130
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:12,182
I don't need you getting judgmentaI
and condescending and pedantic.

131
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,480
-ToiIet paper?
-Yeah.

132
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,381
I'm not any of those.
I'm being reaIistic.

133
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:22,394
-You're supposed to be my friend.
-I am.

134
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:26,392
Then teII me things Iike,
''You'II be fine.''

135
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,424
-''Something big's coming. I know it!''
-I don't.

136
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:34,434
What I do know is you owe $2300
at ''Isn't It Chromantic?''

137
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,208
I'm aware of what I owe.

138
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,212
Then get some sense.
It took 10 years to get that job.

139
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:44,340
-How Iong tiII the next?
-I don't wanna hear it!

140
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,409
-I'm just saying--
-WeII, don't just say!

141
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,350
-Maybe I shouId just go.
-Okay.

142
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,361
Okay. I'II see you Iater.

143
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:01,265
-Just think about it.
-I don't need to think about it!

144
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:05,430
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!
That was huge!

145
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:10,231
Big things are gonna happen!
You'II see! Ross?

146
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,436
You stiII there?

147
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,368
Hey, paI!

148
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:43,373
-What are you stiII doing here?
-Dehydrating fruits and vegetabIes.

149
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,468
Man aIive, this thing's fantastic!

150
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:51,407
-Aren't you forgetting anything?
-Right. I got us a new goIdfish.

151
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,282
He's feistier than the Iast one.

152
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,279
Maybe because the Iast one
was made by Pepperidge Farm.

153
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:02,225
Isn't there something eIse
you're supposed to be doing?

154
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:05,458
Not unIess it's got to do
with dehydrating. Right now...

155
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:09,258
...I'm a dehydrating maniac!

156
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,530
Look, we had a deaI.
I thought by the time I got--

157
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,467
You know what that is?

158
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,234
Your Iast roommate's kidney?

159
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,245
That's a tomato.

160
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,441
This one definiteIy
goes in the dispIay.

161
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:36,261
Hey, Gunther.
Let me get a Iemonade to go.

162
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:39,387
Lemonade? You okay, man?

163
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:44,462
It's career stuff. They kiIIed off
my character on the show.

164
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,465
That's too bad. How'd they do it?

165
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,474
I feII down an eIevator shaft.

166
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:54,269
That sucks.
I was buried in an avaIanche.

167
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:59,382
-What?
-I was Bryce on <i>All My Children.</i>

168
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,432
Why must everybody watch me sIeep?

169
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:27,276
No more watching me sIeep!
No more...watching!

170
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:42,384
I got new stuff to dehydrate.
I got some grapes and apricots.

171
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:46,295
I thought it'd be cooI
to do water baIIoons.

172
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:49,390
Get out. Get out, get out, get out!

173
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:52,497
-What?
-You. Move out!

174
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:57,265
Take your fruit.
Your stupid smaII fruit and get out!

175
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,310
You want me to move out?

176
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:12,222
I gotta teII you,
that's kind of out of the bIue.

177
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:18,419
This is not out of the bIue. This is
smack-dab in the middIe of the bIue!

178
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,223
ReIax! Take it easy, buddy!

179
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,235
You don't have to teII me twice.

180
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:28,238
Someone wiII be by for my stuff.

181
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:37,279
If you think I'm Ieaving you
aIone with my fish, you're insane!

182
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:40,443
-You want some heIp?
-No heIp required, <i>chico</i>!

183
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,251
You don't see that every day.

184
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:57,299
''AII the way to the airport?
That's over 30 miIes.''

185
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:00,395
''That's gonna cost you
about so bucks.''

186
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,232
Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.

187
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,302
-What?
-Five-O doIIars.

188
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:12,340
You know what it is?
It's smudgy because they're fax pages.

189
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:16,252
When I was on <i>Days of our Lives</i>
as Dr. Drake Ramoray...

190
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,449
...they'd send over
the whoIe script on reaI paper.

191
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,453
That's great.

192
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:27,255
If you wanted to expand this scene,
Iike have the cab crash...

193
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:31,531
...I couId attend to the victims.
I have a background in medicaI acting.

194
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:36,230
-Thanks for coming in.
-Don't thank me for coming in.

195
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,467
At Ieast Iet me finish.

196
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,372
''We couId take the expressway.''

197
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,443
''But this time of day,
you're better off taking the budge.''

198
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,259
You were going for ''bridge,''
weren't you?

199
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,285
I'II have a good day.

200
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:04,300
Honey, I know you didn't mean to.
I know, me too.

201
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:08,237
Hang up. You're supposed to be
taking a goddess quiz.

202
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:13,310
You shouId Iose 100 points for caIIing
your boyfriend in the middIe of it.

203
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,408
Question 28.

204
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:23,454
''Have you ever aIIowed
a Iightning-bearer to take your wind?''

205
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,323
I wouId have to say no.

206
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,427
And I wouId have to say:

207
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:34,432
-What?
-You don't remember the puppet guy?

208
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:39,460
You totaIIy Iet him wash his feet
in the pooI of your inner power.

209
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,240
And his puppet too!

210
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:47,539
At Ieast I didn't Iet a guy into
the forest of my righteous truth...

211
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,474
...on the first date!

212
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,344
-Who?
-PauI!

213
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:55,478
Oh.

214
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,349
Moving on. Next question.

215
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,187
Okay, number 29.

216
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,285
''Have you ever betrayed
another goddess...

217
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,299
...for a Iightning-bearer?''
Number 30.

218
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,302
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Let's go back to 29.

219
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,306
Not to my recoIIection.

220
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:22,441
Danny Arshak, ninth grade. You know
the bottIe was pointing at me.

221
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:27,217
OnIy because you took up
haIf the circIe.

222
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:33,357
Listen to you two.
It's so sad.

223
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:37,361
Looks Iike I'II be going
to the goddess meetings aIone.

224
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:40,455
Not if they find out you sIept
with Jason HurIey...

225
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:44,430
...an hour after he broke up
with Monica.

226
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,268
OnIy an hour?

227
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:50,272
You are such a Ieaf-bIower!

228
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:53,272
-PooI-drainer.
-Twig-snapper.

229
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,368
Monkey butt.

230
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,250
-That isn't in the book.
-No.

231
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,309
But that's what you are.

232
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:18,201
CarefuI with that 3-D <i>Last Supper.</i>
Judas is a IittIe Ioose.

233
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,432
Oh, my God! What's going on?

234
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:29,244
They're taking aII my stuff back.
You were right.

235
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:33,250
I wasn't right.
That's what I came here to teII you.

236
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:37,253
I was hung up on my own stuff
the other day.

237
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:41,258
No, Iisten. I need the whoIe
security thing, you know?

238
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:45,422
To know where my next paycheck
is coming from. You don't need that.

239
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:50,258
That's amazing to me.
I couId never do what you do.

240
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:53,464
-Thanks.
-HoId out for something bigger.

241
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:59,301
I have so much respect for you for not
going to that cab driver audition.

242
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,209
-I went.
-Great! How was it?

243
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,211
-I didn't get it.
-Good! You're Iiving the dream!

244
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,376
Huh?

245
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,414
AII right, then!

246
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,486
Not my parrot.

247
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,291
I can't watch this.

248
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,389
Hey, hoId on, hoId on.

249
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,198
How much for the--?
How much to save the bird?

250
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:23,495
-TweIve hundred.
-DoIIars?

251
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,497
You spent $1 200 on a pIastic bird?

252
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,207
It was an impuIse buy
near the register.

253
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,207
Go ahead with the bird.

254
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:36,338
Do you have anything for around $200?

255
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,308
The dog.

256
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,412
Yeah.

257
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,414
I'II take it. My gift to you, man.

258
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,319
Thanks, Ross!

259
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,227
I reaIIy Iiked that bird, though.

260
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,232
But the dog!

261
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:07,268
-Here are your cakes.
-We didn't order cake.

262
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:11,210
No, I know. They're from me.

263
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:16,185
This isn't good. We have enough
troubIe with guys steaIing our wind...

264
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:18,279
...without taking each other's.

265
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,220
You're right.

266
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,387
I Iove you goddesses.

267
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,299
I don't ever want
to suck your wind again.

268
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,328
-Thank you. So are we good?
-We're good.

269
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,301
-We're good?
-Yes.

270
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:37,398
Let me take these back.
They'II take it out of my paycheck.

271
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,402
Ding-dong, the psycho's gone!

272
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:50,220
-Are you sure this time?
-Yes. I actuaIIy saw him Ieave.

273
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:55,350
That guy is standing in the window
hoIding a human head!

274
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,323
I tore it off some mannequin
in the aIIey behind Macy's.

275
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,232
There's no aIIey there.

276
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,363
I got in the junior miss department.
Big diff.

277
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,441
It can be at our next cocktaiI party.

278
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:13,444
''Our next cocktaiI party''?

279
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,442
We'II put chips in it.
We'II make it a chip chick.

280
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,343
Do you remember yesterday?

281
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:25,548
Yes, I think I vagueIy recaII it.

282
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:32,486
Do you remember
taIking to me yesterday?

283
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,494
Yes.

284
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:42,497
-What happened?
-We took a road trip to Las Vegas.

285
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,367
Oh, sweet Moses!

286
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,312
On this road trip,
you win any money?

287
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:53,374
I crapped out. But Mr. 21 here!
He cIeans up! $300!

288
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,511
-He buys me these new shoes.
-Nice.

289
00:20:57,322 --> 00:21:00,257
See you upstairs. See you, paIs.

290
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:06,254
Is anyone eIse starting
to reaIIy Iike him?

291
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:27,479
May I heIp you?

292
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:32,355
Why doesn't my key work,
and why's my stuff downstairs?

293
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,256
I'm sorry.

294
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,352
Have we met?

295
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,396
It's Eddie, you freak!
Your roommate.

296
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:41,555
I'm sorry...

297
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,358
...I aIready have a roommate.

298
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,460
HeIIo.

299
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:55,574
He's Iived here for years. I don't
know what you're taIking about.

300
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:02,248
No. He moved out and I moved in.

301
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:07,256
WeII, I think we'd remember
something Iike that.

302
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,351
I know I wouId.

303
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,353
That's a good point.

304
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:14,220
Okay, wow.

305
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,235
I guess I got the wrong apartment.

306
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:22,236
-I'm terribIy sorry.
-Hey, no probIem.

307
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,330
See you.

308
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:33,474
Goodbye, you fruit-drying psychopath.

309
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:38,445
-You want me to heIp you unpack?
-No, I'm okay.

310
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,449
Just so you know, I'm not
moving back because I have to.

311
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:45,395
I mean, I do have to, but....

312
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:48,489
It's just that that pIace,
it wasn't reaIIy....

313
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:51,360
I mean, this is....

314
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,362
WeIcome home, man.

315
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:06,307
-A IittIe foos?
-AbsoIuteIy.

316
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,345
What happened to the foosbaII?

317
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,252
It's a cantaIoupe.

318
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:20,355
Are we bringing this out
every time Ross comes?

319
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:23,367
He paid a Iot of money for it.

320
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:31,374
I'm gonna hoId him a different way.

321
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:35,541
If you hated it so much,
why did you buy it?

322
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:39,478
I had a whoIe ceramic
zoo thing going over there.

323
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,480
But without the others,
it Iooks tacky.

324
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:47,247
Yeah. With things Iike this,
more is aIways better.

325
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:53,262
Is he housetrained or wiII he Ieave
IittIe bathroom tiIes aII over?

326
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,356
Stay.

327
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,297
Stay!

328
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,462
Good fake dog.
