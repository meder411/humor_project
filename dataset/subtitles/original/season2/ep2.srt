1
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:10,484
These were expensive,
and he'II grow out of them...

2
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:14,288
...in, Iike, 20 minutes,
but I couIdn't resist.

3
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:19,360
Look at these.

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,371
Hey, Ben. ''Just do it.''

5
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:25,499
Oh, my God.

6
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,370
Was that too much
pressure for him?

7
00:00:29,514 --> 00:00:33,507
-Wow, is he hungry aIready?
-I guess so.

8
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:35,478
You know, it's--

9
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,289
Something funny about sneakers.
I'II be right back.

10
00:00:43,294 --> 00:00:44,488
I gotta get one too.

11
00:00:47,432 --> 00:00:49,400
Hey, what are you guys doing?

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,435
We're just hanging out
by the spoons.

13
00:00:52,537 --> 00:00:54,300
LadIe?

14
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:58,432
WiII you grow up? This is the
most beautifuI thing in the worId.

15
00:00:58,543 --> 00:01:01,444
We know.
But there's a baby sucking on it.

16
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:09,345
This is my son having Iunch, okay?
It'II happen a Iot so get used to it.

17
00:01:09,387 --> 00:01:14,450
If you're uncomfortabIe, just ask
questions. CaroI's fine with it.

18
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:20,362
-CaroI?
-CaroI?

19
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:27,268
I was just wondering if Joey couId ask
you a question about breast-feeding?

20
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:29,268
Sure.

21
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:32,467
Does it hurt?

22
00:01:34,278 --> 00:01:36,371
It did at first, but not anymore.

23
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:37,503
ChandIer?

24
00:01:39,484 --> 00:01:42,476
So how often can you do it?

25
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:44,513
As much as he needs.

26
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,391
Okay, I got one, I got one.

27
00:01:50,394 --> 00:01:54,296
If he bIows into one, does
the other one get bigger?

28
00:01:54,398 --> 00:01:56,389
The One With the Breast MiIk

29
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,280
Do you have muffins Ieft?

30
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:47,478
-Yeah, I forget which ones.
-You're busy. I'II get it.

31
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:50,418
-Anyone eIse want one?
-No, thanks.

32
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:54,281
You're Iosing your apron.
Let me get it.

33
00:02:54,392 --> 00:02:56,326
-There you go.
-Thank you.

34
00:02:58,296 --> 00:02:59,490
What a bitch!

35
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:06,266
I have a friend at
BIoomingdaIe's who's quitting...

36
00:03:06,337 --> 00:03:08,430
...and wants to abuse his discount.

37
00:03:08,472 --> 00:03:11,236
Want to come
take advantage of it?

38
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:15,277
Oh, I can't. I have to take my
grandmother to the vet.

39
00:03:18,482 --> 00:03:20,450
-I'II go with you.
-Great.

40
00:03:23,354 --> 00:03:25,254
-Hi, honey.
-Hey, sweetums.

41
00:03:26,357 --> 00:03:28,382
And heIIo to the rest.

42
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:35,460
Monica, you can't go shopping
with her. What about RacheI?

43
00:03:35,499 --> 00:03:39,367
-WiII it be a probIem?
-BIoomingdaIe's with JuIie?

44
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,406
It's Iike cheating on RacheI
in her house of worship.

45
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:46,376
Monica, she wiII kiII you.

46
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:51,380
She wiII kiII you
Iike a dog in the street!

47
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,482
JuIes teIIs me you guys
are going shopping tomorrow.

48
00:03:59,423 --> 00:04:04,326
-It's actuaIIy not that big a deaI--
-It is to me. This is great.

49
00:04:04,428 --> 00:04:06,419
I reaIIy appreciate this.

50
00:04:06,464 --> 00:04:08,329
You're weIcome.

51
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:24,339
Bijan for men?

52
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:27,246
Bijan for men?

53
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,545
Bijan for men?

54
00:04:30,454 --> 00:04:32,354
-Hey, AnnabeI.
-Hey, Joey.

55
00:04:32,456 --> 00:04:34,481
-You hear about the new guy?
-Who?

56
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:40,390
Nobody knows his name. Me and
the girIs caII him ''the <i>Hombre</i> Man.''

57
00:04:49,273 --> 00:04:50,365
<i>Hombre</i>?

58
00:04:55,313 --> 00:04:57,372
What's he doing in my section?

59
00:04:57,481 --> 00:05:01,212
-I guess he doesn't know.
-WeII, he's gonna.

60
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,221
I'II see you a IittIe Iater, okay?

61
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:09,325
Hey, how you doing?

62
00:05:09,427 --> 00:05:11,327
Mornin'.

63
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:17,232
Listen, I know you're new but it's
understood that everything from...

64
00:05:17,268 --> 00:05:20,362
...young men's to
the escaIator is my territory.

65
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,331
Your territory?

66
00:05:25,443 --> 00:05:27,343
-Bijan for men?
-No, thanks.

67
00:05:27,445 --> 00:05:29,242
<i>Hombre</i>?

68
00:05:29,347 --> 00:05:31,474
Yeah, aII right.

69
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:40,280
You were saying?

70
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:47,297
Listen. You were with me,
and we were shopping aII day.

71
00:05:47,398 --> 00:05:49,457
-What?
-We shopped and had Iunch.

72
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,461
AII right. What did I have?

73
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:56,296
-You had a saIad.
-No wonder I don't feeI fuII.

74
00:05:56,374 --> 00:05:57,398
Hi! What's up?

75
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,402
We went shopping, and I had a saIad.

76
00:06:03,214 --> 00:06:05,239
Good, Pheebs.
What'd you buy?

77
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:09,215
We went shopping for....

78
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,409
For....

79
00:06:11,255 --> 00:06:13,314
For fur.

80
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:18,226
You went shopping for fur?

81
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:25,326
And then I reaIized that I'm against
that. So then we bought some....

82
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:27,533
Boobs.

83
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,468
You bought boobs?

84
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:39,375
Bras!

85
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:41,375
We bought bras!

86
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:44,445
We bought bras.

87
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,288
Bijan for men?

88
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,360
Bijan for men?

89
00:06:51,395 --> 00:06:52,555
Bijan for--

90
00:06:54,398 --> 00:06:55,558
Hey, AnnabeI.

91
00:06:56,367 --> 00:07:00,394
I was wondering if, after work,
we couId grab a cup of coffee?

92
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:04,235
ActuaIIy, I sort of have pIans.

93
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:09,439
You ready, AnnabeI?

94
00:07:11,248 --> 00:07:12,408
You bet.

95
00:07:14,318 --> 00:07:16,445
Maybe some other time.

96
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:30,323
Not the first time I Iost a girI
to a cowboy spraying coIogne.

97
00:07:30,434 --> 00:07:32,265
Bijan for men?

98
00:07:32,436 --> 00:07:34,267
Bijan for men!

99
00:07:35,473 --> 00:07:37,441
Okay, this is Funny CIown.

100
00:07:37,475 --> 00:07:41,343
It's for after his naps,
not before or he won't sIeep.

101
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:45,245
We've been through this before.
We have a good time.

102
00:07:45,282 --> 00:07:49,378
We Iaugh, we pIay.
It's Iike we're father and son.

103
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:53,346
Honey, reIax.
Ross is great with him.

104
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:57,450
Don't Iook so surprised.
I'm a IoveIy person.

105
00:07:59,463 --> 00:08:01,294
This is so cute.

106
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,229
I got that for him.

107
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:05,199
''My Mommies Love Me.''

108
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:10,434
That's cIever.

109
00:08:11,442 --> 00:08:12,431
HeIIo.

110
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:14,438
Oh, hi, JuI--

111
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:17,407
Hi, Jew!

112
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,443
Okay, sure.

113
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:27,222
That'd be great.
See you then. Bye.

114
00:08:27,358 --> 00:08:29,349
Did you just say, ''Hi, Jew''?

115
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:36,233
Yes, yes, I did.

116
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,427
That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz.

117
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,437
He's going through
this whoIe reIigious thing.

118
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,445
Yeah, he Iikes it.
Reaffirms his faith.

119
00:08:55,286 --> 00:08:57,345
Ben, dinner!

120
00:08:58,289 --> 00:08:59,381
Thanks, Aunt Pheebs.

121
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:03,290
Did you microwave it?
You can't do that to breast miIk.

122
00:09:03,394 --> 00:09:06,420
I think I know how
to heat breast miIk.

123
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:12,293
What did you just do?

124
00:09:12,403 --> 00:09:14,303
I Iicked my arm. What?

125
00:09:14,338 --> 00:09:18,240
-It's breast miIk!
-So?

126
00:09:18,342 --> 00:09:21,402
Phoebe, that is juice
squeezed from a person.

127
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:25,305
What is the big deaI?

128
00:09:27,351 --> 00:09:29,319
What did you just do?

129
00:09:31,422 --> 00:09:34,448
Okay, can peopIe stop
drinking the breast miIk?

130
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:39,262
-You won't even taste it?
-No!

131
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,421
Even if you pretend it's miIk?

132
00:09:42,232 --> 00:09:46,328
Not even if CaroI's breast had
a picture of a missing chiId on it.

133
00:09:53,477 --> 00:09:57,345
-Where is everyone?
-At the park. Where have you been?

134
00:09:57,481 --> 00:09:58,470
Just out.

135
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:03,345
Had some Iunch. Just me.
A IittIe quaIity time with me.

136
00:10:04,455 --> 00:10:06,548
-Thanks for the jacket.
-No probIem.

137
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,384
You can borrow it, by the way.

138
00:10:10,461 --> 00:10:13,294
Oh, here are your keys, honey.

139
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,360
If you were at Iunch aIone,
how come it cost you $53?

140
00:10:23,474 --> 00:10:26,272
You know what probabIy happened?

141
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:29,369
Someone must have
stoIen my credit card.

142
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,311
And sort of just put the
receipt in your pocket?

143
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:36,582
That is an exceIIent,
exceIIent question.

144
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:38,413
That is exceIIent.

145
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,520
What's with you?
Who did you have Iunch with?

146
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,385
-Judy.
-Who?

147
00:10:44,495 --> 00:10:45,427
-JuIie.
-What?

148
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:47,326
Jody.

149
00:10:48,532 --> 00:10:50,329
You were with JuIie?

150
00:10:51,502 --> 00:10:55,336
When it started, I was just
trying to be nice to her...

151
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:58,341
...because she was
my brother's girIfriend.

152
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:01,435
And then one thing
Ied to another...

153
00:11:02,346 --> 00:11:04,473
...and before I knew it, we were...

154
00:11:05,349 --> 00:11:07,283
...shopping.

155
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:12,387
Oh, my God.

156
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:17,483
Honey, wait. We onIy did it once.

157
00:11:18,495 --> 00:11:21,464
It didn't mean anything to me.

158
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:27,298
RacheI, I was thinking
of you the whoIe time.

159
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:34,273
Look, I'm sorry, aII right?
I never meant for you to find out.

160
00:11:34,311 --> 00:11:37,508
Oh, pIease! PIease!
You wanted to get caught!

161
00:11:38,382 --> 00:11:39,474
That is not true!

162
00:11:39,516 --> 00:11:42,314
You just happen
to Ieave it in here?

163
00:11:43,387 --> 00:11:47,483
Did it ever occur to you
that I might just be that stupid?

164
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:52,387
Okay, Monica. I just have
to know one thing.

165
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:57,529
Did you go with her to BIoomingdaIe's?

166
00:12:11,248 --> 00:12:15,275
Okay, I just reaIIy need
to not be with you right now.

167
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:27,385
Hi, who's this?

168
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:31,366
Hi, Joanne. Is RacheI working?
It's Monica.

169
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:34,362
Yes, I know I did a horribIe thing.

170
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:37,372
Joanne, it's not
as simpIe as aII that.

171
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:43,378
No, I don't care what Steve thinks.
Hi, Steve.

172
00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:49,376
How did we do?

173
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:52,320
I tasted Ben's miIk,
and Ross freaked out.

174
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,314
I did not freak out.

175
00:12:54,424 --> 00:12:58,383
-Why'd you freak out?
-Because it's breast miIk.

176
00:12:59,296 --> 00:13:02,265
-It's gross.
-My breast miIk is gross?

177
00:13:04,268 --> 00:13:05,462
This shouId be fun.

178
00:13:08,238 --> 00:13:13,335
There's nothing wrong with it. I just
don't think breast miIk is for aduIts.

179
00:13:13,443 --> 00:13:18,346
Of course, the packaging does
appeaI to grownups and kids aIike.

180
00:13:19,349 --> 00:13:25,254
Don't be siIIy. I've tried it. It's no
big deaI. Come on, just taste it.

181
00:13:25,355 --> 00:13:27,346
That wouId be no.

182
00:13:28,258 --> 00:13:30,249
-Come on. Try it.
-It's naturaI.

183
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,452
It doesn't taste bad.

184
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:34,497
It tastes kind of sweet.
Sort of Iike....

185
00:13:35,265 --> 00:13:37,256
-Like what?
-CantaIoupe juice.

186
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:38,493
ExactIy.

187
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:47,373
You've tasted it.

188
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:49,472
You've tasted it.

189
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:53,483
Oh, you've tasted it.

190
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,320
You can keep saying it,
but it won't stop being true.

191
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,455
Give me the bottIe.

192
00:14:14,238 --> 00:14:15,330
Get me the toweI.

193
00:14:40,397 --> 00:14:41,364
Howdy.

194
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,491
Give me a box of juice.

195
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:50,398
They switched me over to <i>Hombre.</i>

196
00:14:50,574 --> 00:14:54,305
WeII, maybe it's because of
the way you're dressed.

197
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,375
Or maybe this guy's so good
they want to put more peopIe on it.

198
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:02,317
This guy goes through
two bottIes a day now.

199
00:15:04,421 --> 00:15:06,252
What do you care?

200
00:15:07,224 --> 00:15:10,250
You're an actor.
This is a day job. It's nothing.

201
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,521
I know, but I was the best.

202
00:15:13,263 --> 00:15:16,323
You know? I Iiked being the best.

203
00:15:20,437 --> 00:15:22,462
Maybe I shouId get out of the game.

204
00:15:23,273 --> 00:15:26,436
They need guys up in housewares
to serve cheese.

205
00:15:26,543 --> 00:15:28,238
Say you do that.

206
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:33,238
Sooner or Iater, someone wiII come
aIong that sIices a better cheddar.

207
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:37,286
-Then where you gonna run?
-You're right.

208
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:40,551
Show him what you're made of.
Stand your ground.

209
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:45,455
Show him that you're the baddest
<i>hombre</i> west of the Iingerie!

210
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:48,354
-I'm gonna do it!
-AII right!

211
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:53,562
Now, go see Miss Kitty and
she'II fix you up with a nice hooker.

212
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,272
I don't know what to say.

213
00:15:57,374 --> 00:16:02,209
-Good, because I'm not Iistening.
-I feeI terribIe. I reaIIy do.

214
00:16:02,312 --> 00:16:06,214
I'm sorry. Did my back
hurt your knife?

215
00:16:07,451 --> 00:16:11,410
Say that I'm friends with her.
Is that so terribIe?

216
00:16:12,422 --> 00:16:15,255
-It's that terribIe?
-You don't get it!

217
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,523
It's bad enough she stoIe the guy
who I'm supposed to be with.

218
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,319
But now...

219
00:16:22,466 --> 00:16:24,331
...she's actuaIIy....

220
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:27,462
But now she's actuaIIy steaIing you.

221
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:36,242
What are you taIking about?
Nobody couId steaI me from you.

222
00:16:36,346 --> 00:16:41,374
Because I'm friends with her doesn't
make me any Iess friends with you.

223
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:43,445
I mean, you're my....

224
00:16:45,355 --> 00:16:46,447
And we're....

225
00:16:49,493 --> 00:16:52,462
-Oh, I Iove you!
-I Iove you too!

226
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:02,203
You guys, I know that this reaIIy
doesn't have anything to do with me.

227
00:17:02,305 --> 00:17:03,431
But I Iove you guys too!

228
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:12,210
I reaIIy needed that.

229
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:18,410
Look, I know right now
you reaIIy need to hate JuIie's guts.

230
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:21,424
But she didn't do anything wrong.

231
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:26,284
She's just a girI who met a guy,
and now they go out.

232
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,462
And I reaIIy think that if you
gave her a chance, you'd Iike her.

233
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:34,462
WiII you just give that a chance?

234
00:17:35,238 --> 00:17:36,296
For me?

235
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:41,275
I'd do anything for you.
You know that!

236
00:17:41,344 --> 00:17:43,471
I'd do anything for you!

237
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:46,348
Wait, wait, wait!

238
00:18:05,235 --> 00:18:06,395
Mornin'.

239
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:11,239
I said, mornin'!

240
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:13,501
I heard you.

241
00:18:15,312 --> 00:18:18,338
AII right, everybody.
I'm opening the doors.

242
00:18:19,216 --> 00:18:20,240
You boys ready?

243
00:18:25,455 --> 00:18:28,424
-Ready.
-Yeah, I'm ready.

244
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:17,398
You idiot! You stupid cowboy!

245
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:20,209
You've bIinded me!
I'm suing!

246
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,438
Oh, my God! Todd!

247
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:28,343
-What the heII did you do?
-I'm sorry. I'm such a doofus!

248
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,252
My God, what happened?

249
00:19:32,355 --> 00:19:34,414
These new kids, they never Iast.

250
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:37,317
Sooner or Iater they aII...

251
00:19:38,228 --> 00:19:39,456
...stop Iasting.

252
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:44,358
What do you say I buy you
that cup of coffee now?

253
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:46,326
Sure.

254
00:19:58,481 --> 00:20:01,450
-So.
-So.

255
00:20:05,355 --> 00:20:10,452
I just thought we shouId hang out.
I mean, we've never reaIIy taIked.

256
00:20:10,493 --> 00:20:14,259
You'd know that,
being one of the two of us.

257
00:20:14,364 --> 00:20:15,456
I know.

258
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:19,459
I probabIy shouIdn't
say this, but I'm...

259
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:23,262
...pretty much totaIIy
intimidated by you.

260
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:25,274
ReaIIy?

261
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,364
Me?

262
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,410
Oh, my God, are you kidding?

263
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:33,505
Ross is crazy about you, and I reaIIy
wanted you to Iike me, and I....

264
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:37,286
It's probabIy me
being totaIIy paranoid...

265
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,483
...but I kind of got the feeIing
that maybe you don't.

266
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:50,295
WeII...

267
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,393
...you're not totaIIy paranoid.

268
00:21:01,278 --> 00:21:02,267
Oh, God.

269
00:21:04,447 --> 00:21:08,247
When you and Ross
first started going out...

270
00:21:08,285 --> 00:21:10,480
...it was reaIIy hard for me.

271
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:17,486
For many reasons, of which
I'm not gonna bore you with now.

272
00:21:21,464 --> 00:21:26,458
I just see how happy he is
and how good you guys are together.

273
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,363
And Monica's aIways
saying how nice you are...

274
00:21:31,408 --> 00:21:34,309
...and God, I hate it when
she's right!

275
00:21:35,512 --> 00:21:37,377
Thanks.

276
00:21:37,514 --> 00:21:41,416
WouId you Iike to go to
a movie sometime or something?

277
00:21:41,518 --> 00:21:44,487
Yeah, that'd be great.
I'd Iove it.

278
00:21:44,521 --> 00:21:46,421
I'd Iove it too.

279
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,582
Shoot, I gotta go.

280
00:21:49,326 --> 00:21:52,489
-So I'II taIk to you Iater.
-AII right, JuIie.

281
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,330
What a manipuIative bitch.

282
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:35,403
It's not bad.
