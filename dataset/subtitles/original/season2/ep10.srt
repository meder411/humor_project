00:00:05,391 --> 00:00:09,452
SIow down! The paper won't be
soId-out at 1 :00 in the morning.

2
00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:12,359
I'm excited!
I've never been reviewed!

3
00:00:12,464 --> 00:00:16,366
You were so amazing as the king.
I was reaIIy impressed.

4
00:00:16,468 --> 00:00:17,492
But you know what?

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,500
You might wanna wear
underwear next time.

6
00:00:21,306 --> 00:00:24,400
When you sat on the throne,
you couId see your...

7
00:00:24,476 --> 00:00:28,503
-...royaI subjects.
-No one wore underwear back then.

8
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:32,478
I'm sure the critics
appreciated your authenticity.

9
00:00:32,518 --> 00:00:34,486
Nice genitaIs, by the way.

10
00:00:35,387 --> 00:00:36,479
Thanks, man.

11
00:00:37,322 --> 00:00:38,414
Here it is!

12
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,324
''The onIy thing worse than
the mindIess direction...

13
00:00:42,394 --> 00:00:47,331
...was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingIy
unskiIIed portrayaI of the king.''

14
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:49,524
Look, that is one guy's opinion.

15
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:52,496
AII right?
Pheebs, read yours.

16
00:00:53,305 --> 00:00:56,433
''The onIy thing worse
than the mindIess--''

17
00:00:56,542 --> 00:01:00,273
Does anybody have one
from a different paper?

18
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:04,247
-Ross, read yours.
-I don't want to.

19
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:10,445
''The one enjoyabIe moment is when the
king is beheaded and speaks no more.''

20
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,484
Joey, they don't know
what they're taIking about.

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,349
Maybe they do.

22
00:01:16,462 --> 00:01:20,489
I've done this 10 years
and I'm nowhere. There's a reason.

23
00:01:21,266 --> 00:01:23,359
Come on, you're just paying dues.

24
00:01:23,402 --> 00:01:27,463
No, no, no. It's too hard.
It's not worth it. I quit.

25
00:01:28,273 --> 00:01:29,297
Come on, Joey!

26
00:01:29,408 --> 00:01:31,501
Wait, wait one minute.
Wait a minute.

27
00:01:32,277 --> 00:01:34,472
I beIieve this wiII change your mind.

28
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,478
''In a mediocre pIay, Joseph Tribbiani

00:01:42,521 --> 00:01:44,284
--sucking.''

31
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,381
The One With Russ

32
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:33,404
Is there anything eIse you
wanted to be?

33
00:02:33,472 --> 00:02:34,496
I don't know.

34
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:37,365
I used to want to be a vet.

35
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:41,470
Then I found out you have to put
your hands into cows and stuff.

36
00:02:46,385 --> 00:02:47,317
Are you okay?

37
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:50,286
Just a tough day at work, you know?

38
00:02:50,322 --> 00:02:53,485
Stegosaurus feII and trapped a kid.

39
00:02:55,427 --> 00:02:59,488
I know this jacket. This is Fun
Bobby's jacket! Where is he?

40
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:01,260
-Is he here?
-Maybe.

41
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:02,526
Don't toy with me.

42
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:05,429
-GeIIer!
-Hey, Fun Bobby!

43
00:03:06,238 --> 00:03:07,535
Hey! You been working out?

44
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:09,262
Not at aII.

45
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:10,467
I Iove this guy!

46
00:03:12,277 --> 00:03:14,370
I'm psyched you're back with Monica.

47
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,380
-You and me both!
-So what'd I miss?

48
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:20,247
We're making Joey feeI better.

49
00:03:20,352 --> 00:03:23,344
-Want me to pick you up?
-I'm aII right, man.

50
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:25,252
I'm picking you up!

51
00:03:25,357 --> 00:03:28,349
No, seriousIy.
I don't need you to--

52
00:03:30,362 --> 00:03:31,454
It stiII works!

53
00:03:32,264 --> 00:03:36,291
Okay, now before I go, does
anybody eIse need to be picked up?

54
00:03:36,368 --> 00:03:37,460
I'm stiII gonna go.

55
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,371
Okay, I'II see you Iater, baby.

56
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:46,403
PubIic dispIay of affection coming up.
You can avert your eyes.

57
00:03:53,385 --> 00:03:55,285
-See you.
-See you Iater.

58
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,480
-Fun Bobby is so great.
-Oh, isn't he?

59
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:03,352
I think this time it may work
with him. He makes me feeI so good.

60
00:04:03,428 --> 00:04:07,262
I've been feeIing Iousy IateIy.
No job, no boyfriend.

61
00:04:07,332 --> 00:04:09,425
At Ieast my cup is haIf-fuII.

62
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:12,326
HaIf-fuII of Iove.

63
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,437
For our two-week anniversary,
we're going to a cabin.

64
00:04:18,477 --> 00:04:21,241
Cabin of Iove.

65
00:04:23,248 --> 00:04:26,479
-We had a Iot of wine tonight.
-I onIy had two gIasses.

66
00:04:27,286 --> 00:04:29,254
-I just had a gIass.
-Two.

67
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:31,481
-I had one.
-I had a mug fuII in this...

68
00:04:32,357 --> 00:04:36,259
...''I got boned at the
Museum of NaturaI History'' mug.

69
00:04:37,262 --> 00:04:39,457
Okay, so that's what?
Two bottIes.

70
00:04:39,498 --> 00:04:42,399
And yet somehow we went through five?

71
00:04:55,314 --> 00:04:57,475
So what?
So he drank a Iot tonight.

72
00:04:57,582 --> 00:05:01,348
Now that I think of it, I don't
think I've seen...

73
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,218
...Fun Bobby without a drink.

74
00:05:05,424 --> 00:05:09,417
And did you notice how
he aIways starts his stories with:

75
00:05:09,528 --> 00:05:14,363
''Okay, I was so wasted!''
or ''Oh, we were so bombed!''

76
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:19,234
''So I wake up and I'm in
this dumpster in Connecticut!''

77
00:05:19,438 --> 00:05:22,430
Have you been with him
when he wasn't drinking?

78
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:26,341
We go to a Iot of pIaces where
you might drink.

79
00:05:26,378 --> 00:05:29,472
How do you go to a winetasting
without drinking?

80
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:32,478
Or to a cIub, or to the...

81
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:34,445
...zoo.

82
00:05:39,358 --> 00:05:41,451
Rach, does this have nonfat miIk?

83
00:05:42,294 --> 00:05:44,262
I don't know, taste it.

84
00:05:46,465 --> 00:05:47,454
No.

85
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:51,463
Oh, weII, too Iate.
Sorry, you aIready had some.

86
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:56,398
What do you say
we make these coffees Irish?

87
00:06:00,312 --> 00:06:01,404
Cake!

88
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:05,314
Yeah, we're gonna get some cake.

89
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:11,445
It seems you've been making
a Iot of stuff ''Irish'' IateIy.

90
00:06:12,257 --> 00:06:17,354
I'd make them BeIgian, but the waffIes
are hard to get into that fIask.

91
00:06:18,363 --> 00:06:19,421
Yeah, okay.

92
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:25,333
Look, maybe it's none of my business.
Or maybe it is, I don't know.

93
00:06:25,437 --> 00:06:27,428
I'm kind of worried about you.

94
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,336
This isn't the first time somebody
said something to me about this.

95
00:06:32,444 --> 00:06:36,278
But I aIways made excuses,
Iike ''I'm a sociaI drinker.''

96
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:38,474
Or ''Come on, it's FIag Day!''

97
00:06:41,253 --> 00:06:43,483
So, what are you saying now?

98
00:06:44,356 --> 00:06:46,347
I guess I'm saying...

99
00:06:46,391 --> 00:06:48,291
...I'II try and quit.

100
00:06:48,393 --> 00:06:51,362
I kind of Iike
that you worry about me.

101
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:55,489
So, what's going on?

102
00:06:56,368 --> 00:07:00,236
-I am gonna try and quit drinking.
-Oh! Why?

103
00:07:07,312 --> 00:07:09,439
Guess who's back in show business.

104
00:07:10,248 --> 00:07:11,510
Lorne Greene?

105
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:15,516
No. You know why? He's dead.

106
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:17,345
Oh, no.

107
00:07:19,424 --> 00:07:24,418
This is gonna seem bittersweet now,
but Joey, that's who!

108
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:29,231
My agent caIIed with an audition
for <i>Days of Our Lives</i>!

109
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:32,428
-Kick ass!
-Here's to Joey!

110
00:07:33,438 --> 00:07:35,235
Here Joey.

111
00:07:38,443 --> 00:07:42,379
We have to ceIebrate.
We shouId do a soap opera theme.

112
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:47,441
We couId aII sIeep together,
then one of us couId get amnesia!

113
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:54,256
When do you get off?
We'II do something tonight.

114
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:58,456
WeII, actuaIIy, I'm aIready done.
But I kind of got pIans.

115
00:07:58,497 --> 00:08:01,295
You have other friends?

116
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:05,301
-Yeah, I.... I have a date.
-What?

117
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:08,338
-You have a date?
-Yes! I have a date.

118
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:10,435
With a man?

119
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:13,300
No, with a crouton.

120
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:18,212
-What's strange about me dating?
-With a crouton?

121
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,441
Rach, what about Ross?

122
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:23,346
You're stiII mad he made that Iist?

123
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:26,219
No, no, I'm not mad at him.

124
00:08:26,324 --> 00:08:29,225
I'm not reaIIy ''anything''
at him anymore.

125
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:33,229
-What are you taIking about?
-I don't know.

126
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:35,426
Whatever I was feeIing, I'm...

127
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,467
...not.

128
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:38,429
You guys came so cIose.

129
00:08:38,503 --> 00:08:42,234
I'm sorry. You'II have
to get used to the fact...

130
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,332
...that I wiII not be dating Ross.

131
00:08:46,344 --> 00:08:47,470
Here he is.

132
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:51,272
Guys, this is Russ.

133
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,274
Hi.

134
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,324
EsteIIe Leonard TaIent Agency.

135
00:09:09,334 --> 00:09:12,303
Sammy wouId you
stop caIIing me aIready.

136
00:09:12,404 --> 00:09:16,340
I'm not saying you're not taIented.
You're very taIented.

137
00:09:16,408 --> 00:09:20,435
But with the bird dead and aII,
there's very IittIe act Ieft.

138
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:23,305
Honey, give me a break, wiII you?

139
00:09:23,348 --> 00:09:25,248
I'II taIk to you Iater.

140
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:29,447
There's my favorite cIient. TeII me,
darIing, how was the audition?

141
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:34,248
I think it went weII.
I got a caIIback for Thursday.

142
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:38,318
-Joey! Have you ever seen me ecstatic?
-No.

143
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,331
WeII, here it is.

144
00:09:44,436 --> 00:09:48,372
Listen, there's something
I want to taIk to you about.

145
00:09:48,473 --> 00:09:52,273
-The casting Iady--
-Oh, isn't Lori a doII?

146
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:54,471
Yeah, she's great, but...

147
00:09:55,246 --> 00:09:59,376
...I kind of got the feeIing that
she was sort of coming on to me.

148
00:09:59,451 --> 00:10:04,252
And I definiteIy wouId get the part
if I were to, you know....

149
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,487
If I sent the IittIe generaI in.

150
00:10:13,298 --> 00:10:17,257
I see! WeII, I'm just gonna
put in a caII here...

151
00:10:17,302 --> 00:10:21,466
...and we'II find out what's going on
and straighten it out.

152
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:23,501
Lori, pIease.

153
00:10:25,477 --> 00:10:27,377
Hi, darIing!

154
00:10:27,412 --> 00:10:33,317
How about Joey Tribbiani for the part
of the cabdriver? Isn't he terrific?

155
00:10:37,322 --> 00:10:39,381
Okay, doII, taIk to you Iater.

156
00:10:39,491 --> 00:10:42,483
You're gonna have to sIeep with her.

157
00:10:45,497 --> 00:10:47,488
-What's the matter?
-Fun Bobby.

158
00:10:47,532 --> 00:10:50,524
-What? Isn't he sober?
-He's sober, aII right.

159
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:54,430
Just turns out that Fun Bobby
was fun for a reason.

160
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,240
AII right, here you go, sweetie.

161
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:04,347
Thanks.
You wanna hear something funny?

162
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:06,440
Oh, God, yes!

163
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:13,253
There are no hardware stores
open past midnight in the ViIIage.

164
00:11:15,293 --> 00:11:17,261
That is funny.

165
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:22,398
I needed to buy a hammer and I'm out
waIking around the neighborhood.

166
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:25,402
And I'm waIking, and I'm waIking...

167
00:11:25,503 --> 00:11:28,370
...and I'm waIking, and I'm waIking--

168
00:11:28,473 --> 00:11:31,374
So you're saying you were waIking.

169
00:11:31,476 --> 00:11:37,381
ApparentIy, no hardware stores
are open past midnight in the ViIIage.

170
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,386
So it's a heIpfuI fact...

171
00:11:44,489 --> 00:11:46,514
...as weII as funny.

172
00:11:51,496 --> 00:11:54,294
Don't you have your interview?

173
00:11:54,332 --> 00:11:55,492
Oh, yeah.

174
00:11:58,436 --> 00:12:01,337
-See you guys.
-Bye...

175
00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:04,374
...ridicuIousIy duII Bobby.

176
00:12:05,276 --> 00:12:06,334
Oh, my God.

177
00:12:06,478 --> 00:12:10,244
-He's not that bad.
-Not that bad?

178
00:12:10,281 --> 00:12:14,377
-Did you not hear the hammer story?
-Okay, don't get aII squinky.

179
00:12:16,287 --> 00:12:19,256
Maybe you had to be there.

180
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,283
But I'm gonna be there!
For the rest of my Iife.

181
00:12:24,462 --> 00:12:28,364
I made him quit drinking.
He's duII because of me.

182
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,491
Don't say that.

183
00:12:30,268 --> 00:12:34,500
He's probabIy aIways been duII.
You just, you know, set it free.

184
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:39,266
-Hi.
-Hey, Ross.

185
00:12:40,512 --> 00:12:45,313
Hi, Russ. I've got two more tabIes
to cIean, and then we'II go.

186
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:47,510
I'II just sit here and...

187
00:12:48,286 --> 00:12:50,481
...chat with your...

188
00:12:50,522 --> 00:12:54,390
...friend-type peopIe.

189
00:12:59,397 --> 00:13:00,455
RacheI?

190
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,359
You know what you're doing, right?

191
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,429
-Waitressing?
-WeII, yeah. But, no. I mean....

192
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:12,471
Doesn't Russ just
remind you of someone?

193
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:16,344
Bob Saget?

194
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:18,347
Oh, yeah!

195
00:13:18,483 --> 00:13:20,348
No, no, no!

196
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:24,387
-Oh, my, oh!
-What's wrong?

197
00:13:26,257 --> 00:13:30,489
She's upset because she buttered a
spider into her toast this morning.

198
00:13:32,497 --> 00:13:34,362
AII right.

199
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:38,462
Listen, Pheebs.
This is gonna be okay.

200
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,271
Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.

201
00:13:42,507 --> 00:13:44,498
-Hi.
-Hi.

202
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:48,470
-Are you a friend of RacheI's?
-Yes. Yes, I am.

203
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,413
Are you a friend of RacheI's?

204
00:13:51,482 --> 00:13:54,474
ActuaIIy, I'm kind of a...

205
00:13:55,286 --> 00:13:56,378
...you know...

206
00:13:56,421 --> 00:13:59,481
...a date-type thing...

207
00:14:00,258 --> 00:14:01,418
...of RacheI's.

208
00:14:02,227 --> 00:14:04,422
-A date?
-I'm her date.

209
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,424
Oh! Oh, you're a....

210
00:14:07,232 --> 00:14:09,359
Oh, you're the date.

211
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:14,228
This is actuaIIy good because if we
Iose Ross, we have a spare.

212
00:14:15,273 --> 00:14:17,434
You are the paIeontoIogist.

213
00:14:18,343 --> 00:14:24,282
-Yes. Yes, I am. And you are a....
-Periodontist.

214
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:28,283
See? Now they're as
different as night and...

215
00:14:28,353 --> 00:14:29,479
...Iater that night.

216
00:14:30,355 --> 00:14:34,257
WeII, I am going to get a beverage.

217
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:38,295
-It was nice meeting you.
-Ditto.

218
00:14:43,501 --> 00:14:46,299
WeII, I met Russ.

219
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:50,468
I didn't know we were
seeing other peopIe.

220
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:54,301
WeII, we're not
seeing each other, so....

221
00:14:54,512 --> 00:14:59,506
For your information, a woman at
the museum who's curator of moths...

222
00:15:00,251 --> 00:15:03,243
...and other winged things...

223
00:15:04,455 --> 00:15:10,416
...Iet it be known that she is
drawn to me, much Iike a...you know.

224
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,424
I've kept her at bay...

225
00:15:13,464 --> 00:15:16,365
...but if this is the deaI--
-It is.

226
00:15:16,434 --> 00:15:18,425
WeII, have a nice evening.

227
00:15:19,437 --> 00:15:22,270
-Russ, you ready?
-Yeah.

228
00:15:23,341 --> 00:15:25,275
-Bye.
-Bye.

229
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,247
She's dating?

230
00:15:30,281 --> 00:15:31,339
She's dating?

231
00:15:31,382 --> 00:15:34,442
Yes, but did you see
who she was dating?

232
00:15:35,386 --> 00:15:38,253
-What do you mean?
-Do you not see it?

233
00:15:38,356 --> 00:15:42,486
See what? I don't know
what she sees in that goober.

234
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:47,457
It takes him, what?
Like, I don't know...

235
00:15:47,565 --> 00:15:50,466
...heIIo, a week
to get out a sentence?

236
00:15:51,402 --> 00:15:53,563
Annoying, isn't it?

237
00:15:56,274 --> 00:15:57,468
Yeah.

238
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,448
You didn't get the part...

239
00:16:11,222 --> 00:16:13,417
...or ItaIy caIIed
and said it was hungry?

240
00:16:14,325 --> 00:16:17,453
-The part's mine if I want it.
-Oh, my God!

241
00:16:18,229 --> 00:16:20,424
If I sIeep with the casting Iady.

242
00:16:21,232 --> 00:16:22,290
Oh, my...

243
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,459
...God?

244
00:16:24,435 --> 00:16:28,337
Ten years I've been waiting
for a break. Ten years!

245
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:33,240
I mean, <i>Days of Our Lives.</i>
That's actuaIIy on teIevision!

246
00:16:33,344 --> 00:16:34,436
What are you gonna do?

247
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:37,441
I guess I couId sIeep with her.
I mean....

248
00:16:37,482 --> 00:16:39,245
How can I do that?

249
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:43,446
I've got a pop-up book that toId me
aII I needed to know.

250
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:48,351
-I never sIept with anyone for a part.
-WeII, is she--?

251
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:52,293
-Sorry.
-It's aII right.

252
00:16:52,363 --> 00:16:56,356
-Is she good-Iooking?
-Yeah. She's totaIIy good-Iooking.

253
00:16:56,401 --> 00:17:00,337
If I met her in a bar,
I'd be buying her breakfast.

254
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:04,436
You know, after having sIept with her.

255
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,339
Maybe this isn't such a big deaI.

256
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:17,252
The way that I see it is, you get a
great job, and you get to have sex!

257
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:21,348
Throw in a tree and a fat guy,
and you've got Christmas!

258
00:17:24,228 --> 00:17:28,221
I just don't think that I want it
that way, you know?

259
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:30,460
I mean, Iet's say I do make it.

260
00:17:31,235 --> 00:17:35,365
I'II aIways Iook back and wonder
if it was because of my taIent or...

261
00:17:35,473 --> 00:17:38,340
...you know, the IittIe generaI.

262
00:17:40,244 --> 00:17:42,542
Didn't you used to caII it
''the IittIe major''?

263
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:47,240
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco,
I had to promote it.

264
00:17:51,456 --> 00:17:55,256
-Something from the bar?
-Yes, I wouId Iike something.

265
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,328
No. No, thank you.

266
00:17:58,362 --> 00:18:02,230
If you wanna drink, it's okay.
I've gotta get used to it.

267
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:07,294
No, reaIIy. I wouIdn't feeI
right about it. Just some water.

268
00:18:07,405 --> 00:18:12,240
-So my refrigerator Iight's out.
-Scotch on the rocks with a twist!

269
00:18:13,211 --> 00:18:13,506
I'm sorry.

270
00:18:14,245 --> 00:18:16,338
We're having fun now, huh, Ross?

271
00:18:16,414 --> 00:18:19,212
Wanna do another one? Huh, Russ?

272
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:23,412
Okay. EIeven Ietters...

273
00:18:23,454 --> 00:18:27,322
...atomic eIement number 101 ,
ends in ''-ium.''

274
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:30,427
-Dysprosium.
-Dysprosium.

275
00:18:31,229 --> 00:18:35,222
-Try mendeIevium.
-And weenie number two has it.

276
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:40,427
UnIess ''Nights in White Satin''
was sung by the Doody BIues.

277
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:47,333
-You actuaIIy don't see it?
-What?

278
00:18:47,445 --> 00:18:49,345
Honey, you're dating Ross.

279
00:18:49,447 --> 00:18:54,248
-No, Pheebs, I'm dating Russ.
-Russ is Ross. Russ, Ross.

280
00:18:54,285 --> 00:18:55,377
Steve, sIeeve.

281
00:18:55,486 --> 00:19:01,186
-Okay, no one is named sIeeve.
-What are you taIking about?

282
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:05,286
Other than their names being simiIar,
I do not see what you see.

283
00:19:05,396 --> 00:19:09,389
For your information,
it's a cardsharp, not a card shark.

284
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:11,395
You couIdn't be more wrong.

285
00:19:12,203 --> 00:19:15,195
You couId try,
but you wouIdn't be successfuI.

286
00:19:15,306 --> 00:19:19,333
I'II get more coffee before
the pinching and eye-poking begins.

287
00:19:21,312 --> 00:19:24,213
-I know your probIem.
-Oh, you do, do you?

288
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:26,439
You're jeaIous.

289
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:29,513
Of what?

290
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:33,417
You're jeaIous
because I'm a reaI doctor.

291
00:19:34,425 --> 00:19:36,359
You're a doctor of gums.

292
00:19:36,427 --> 00:19:40,363
That's the smaIIest body part
you can major in.

293
00:19:41,232 --> 00:19:43,359
Day one, fIoss.
Day two, your dipIoma.

294
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:45,425
-Listen here--
-Let me finish.

295
00:19:45,469 --> 00:19:50,270
-No, Iet me finish.
-No, you Iet me fin--

296
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:07,254
-Did Joey say what he was gonna do?
-I don't even think he knew.

297
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:09,451
WouId you sIeep with someone
for a job?

298
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:12,387
Who wouId I have to sIeep with?

299
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:14,361
Me.

300
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,265
Why with you?

301
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:20,462
It's my game. Want the job or not?

302
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:26,400
-Good morning.
-Where you going?

303
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:30,379
Bobby and I are going away
for the weekend. Remember?

304
00:20:31,282 --> 00:20:34,410
-What's with aII the Iiquor?
-Excuse me, miss.

305
00:20:34,518 --> 00:20:39,478
In a water Ianding, can this seat
be used as a fIotation device?

306
00:20:40,491 --> 00:20:43,289
Is Bobby drinking again?

307
00:20:43,394 --> 00:20:46,488
This is not for him. This is for me.

308
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:51,529
That way, he's sober but I find his
shoeIace stories more amusing.

309
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,501
God! Even his knock is boring!

310
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:04,439
-I'II be ready in a second.
-CouId I taIk to you?

311
00:21:04,482 --> 00:21:05,471
Sure.

312
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:09,282
This is hard to say.

313
00:21:09,387 --> 00:21:13,255
-You feII off the wagon!
-Oh, no, no.

314
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:15,484
-It's about you.
-What about me?

315
00:21:16,394 --> 00:21:19,454
I think you may have
a drinking probIem.

316
00:21:22,266 --> 00:21:23,358
What, these?

317
00:21:23,467 --> 00:21:26,459
No, these are for cuts and scrapes.

318
00:21:28,306 --> 00:21:33,369
Look, I'm not strong enough to be in
a codependent reIationship right now.

319
00:21:33,477 --> 00:21:35,502
Oh, shoot.

320
00:21:37,481 --> 00:21:40,416
WeII, anyway,
I hope we can be friends.

321
00:21:40,484 --> 00:21:42,418
Okay.

322
00:21:45,323 --> 00:21:47,314
-Take care.
-Okay. You too.

323
00:21:47,425 --> 00:21:48,483
Bye.

324
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:56,426
-What happened?
-WeII, we kind of broke up.

325
00:22:03,441 --> 00:22:07,377
-Does anybody want these?
-I'II take one.

326
00:22:07,445 --> 00:22:12,280
Sometimes I hoId stuff Iike this
and pretend I'm a giant.

327
00:22:15,486 --> 00:22:18,353
-Hey.
-How'd the caIIback go?

328
00:22:18,456 --> 00:22:22,358
It was unbeIievabIe. I waIked in
and she was aII over me.

329
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,451
-So?
-I couIdn't do it.
