1
00:00:01,476 --> 00:00:07,415
Okay, here's his diaper bag
and his Mr. Winky.

2
00:00:08,316 --> 00:00:09,578
And...

3
00:00:10,485 --> 00:00:12,385
...him. Hi!

4
00:00:13,288 --> 00:00:15,313
-How did everything go?
-Great!

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:20,418
There was a projectiIe throwing up
incident, but he started it.

6
00:00:21,496 --> 00:00:23,430
We've gotta go.

7
00:00:24,499 --> 00:00:26,399
Oh, right.

8
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:28,528
I've got some news.
It's about us.

9
00:00:29,304 --> 00:00:32,296
-You and me?
-No. Susan and me.

10
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,307
The other ''us.''

11
00:00:38,447 --> 00:00:40,506
We're getting married.

12
00:00:45,554 --> 00:00:49,422
As in, ''I now pronounce you
wife and wife'' married?

13
00:00:50,325 --> 00:00:53,556
We'd Iike you to come.
We understand if you don't want to.

14
00:00:54,362 --> 00:00:58,355
Why wouIdn't I want to come?
I had fun at the first wedding.

15
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,458
I just thought that--

16
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:05,365
Why shouIdn't I be happy for you?
What wouId it say about me...

17
00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:08,466
...if I couIdn't reveI
in your joy?

18
00:01:08,577 --> 00:01:11,375
And I'm reveIing, baby!
BeIieve me!

19
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,374
Is your finger caught in that chair?

20
00:01:16,485 --> 00:01:18,476
Want us to go?

21
00:01:20,388 --> 00:01:22,413
The One With the Lesbian Wedding

22
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,500
This is cooI.
You're actuaIIy on teIevision.

23
00:02:11,273 --> 00:02:17,303
I know. It reaIIy hit me Iast night.
I'm gonna be on <i>Days of Our Lives.</i>

24
00:02:17,412 --> 00:02:23,282
Then I started thinking about us,
and how these are the days of our Iives.

25
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,419
-Yes!
-What?

26
00:02:26,488 --> 00:02:30,288
CaroI and Susan's caterer
had a bike accident...

27
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:32,486
...and she's in a fuII-body cast.

28
00:02:33,428 --> 00:02:35,396
Yes!

29
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,296
They asked me, which is cooI
since I've never catered...

30
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:41,494
...and I need money.
Is this a probIem?

31
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,432
-WouId it matter?
-You're so great! Thank you!

32
00:02:45,507 --> 00:02:48,408
-You're reaIIy not going?
-I'm reaIIy not.

33
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:52,402
They aIready Iive together.
Why do they need to get married?

34
00:02:52,514 --> 00:02:54,311
They Iove each other.

35
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:58,409
They wanna ceIebrate that Iove
with the peopIe cIose to them.

36
00:02:58,453 --> 00:03:01,354
If you wanna caII that a reason.

37
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:05,357
<i>Who's the bitterest man</i>
<i>In the living room?</i>

38
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,358
<i>The bitterest man</i>
<i>In the living room?</i>

39
00:03:09,497 --> 00:03:11,465
Hi, neighbor.

40
00:03:13,368 --> 00:03:17,361
-I thought you were over this.
-That has nothing to do with it.

41
00:03:17,472 --> 00:03:21,374
If she were marrying a guy,
you wouIdn't expect me to go.

42
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:26,278
If she were marrying a guy,
she'd be the worst Iesbian ever.

43
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:29,475
Did I miss it?

44
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:33,385
No, I'm on right after this guy
shoots himseIf.

45
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:36,280
She's pretty.

46
00:03:36,324 --> 00:03:40,488
And she's nice. She taught me
about how to work with the cameras...

47
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,496
...and smeII-the-fart acting.

48
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:48,400
-I'm sorry, what?
-Excuse me?

49
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:51,303
SmeII-the-fart acting.

50
00:03:51,506 --> 00:03:55,306
You got so many Iines
to Iearn that sometimes...

51
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,345
...you need a minute
to remember your next.

52
00:03:58,413 --> 00:04:00,278
So whiIe you're thinking...

53
00:04:00,348 --> 00:04:03,442
...you take this big pause
where you Iook aII intense.

54
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:05,446
Like this....

55
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,387
Here's my scene!
Here's my scene!

56
00:04:16,498 --> 00:04:18,363
<i>Mrs. Wallace?</i>

57
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,301
<i>Dr. Drake Ramoray,</i>
<i>your sister's neurosurgeon.</i>

58
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:23,394
<i>Is she going to be all right?</i>

59
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:27,407
<i>I'm afraid the situation is</i>
<i>much more dire than we'd expected.</i>

60
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,467
<i>Your sister's suffering from a...</i>

61
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:38,275
<i>...subcranial hematoma.</i>

62
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:43,480
<i>Perhaps we can discuss this</i>
<i>further over coffee.</i>

63
00:04:49,597 --> 00:04:51,394
Nice!

64
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,493
For a minute, I thought you were
actuaIIy smeIIing something.

65
00:04:58,606 --> 00:05:00,335
<i>-Again!</i>
<i>-All right!</i>

66
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,434
-That was so good!
-Do it again.

67
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:07,245
Damn it, Braverman!
It's right there on the chart!

68
00:05:08,283 --> 00:05:12,276
I gotta get to work.
I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.

69
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:15,482
-No, no, that's me.
-Oh, right.

70
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:22,262
Oh, thanks. CouIdn't....

71
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:26,392
-Is everything okay?
-No.

72
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:32,498
One of my cIients died
on the massage tabIe today.

73
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:34,468
Oh, my God!

74
00:05:35,276 --> 00:05:38,268
That's a IittIe more reIaxed
than you want them.

75
00:05:40,482 --> 00:05:43,383
She was, you know,
82 years oId...

76
00:05:43,485 --> 00:05:46,511
...and her name was
Mrs. AdeIman.

77
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:50,485
-Oh, honey.
-It's just so strange.

78
00:05:50,525 --> 00:05:53,426
She probabIy woke up today
and thought...

79
00:05:53,495 --> 00:05:57,431
...I'II have breakfast,
take a waIk, then have my massage.

80
00:05:57,499 --> 00:06:02,232
LittIe did she know God was thinking,
''Okay, but that's it.''

81
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:07,340
Oh, but the weirdest thing was...

82
00:06:07,442 --> 00:06:10,468
...I was cIeansing her aura
when it happened.

83
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:17,240
And when her spirit Ieft her body,
I don't think it went very far.

84
00:06:17,352 --> 00:06:21,448
-What do you mean?
-I think it went into me.

85
00:06:30,365 --> 00:06:33,493
This is so hard.
I can't decide between Iamb or duck.

86
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,463
Lambs are scarier.

87
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:39,468
Or the movie wouId have been caIIed
<i>Silence of the Ducks.</i>

88
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,470
Okay, who ordered what?

89
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:47,413
I had the haIf-drunk cappuccino
with the Iipstick on the rim.

90
00:06:47,482 --> 00:06:51,282
This with the cigarette butt
in it, that's decaf?

91
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,513
Oh, God.

92
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,313
You're so uptight
about your mom coming.

93
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,517
I just don't want her to think that...

94
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:01,319
...because I didn't marry Barry,
my Iife is crap.

95
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:04,330
TaIk about crap,
Iisten to SteIIa Neidman...

96
00:07:04,432 --> 00:07:09,335
...teII her story about Rod Steiger
for the hundredth time.

97
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:18,344
I'm sorry. At Ieast you guys don't
have to hear what she says in my head.

98
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:25,250
Pheebs? How Iong do you think
this Iady wiII be with us?

99
00:07:25,353 --> 00:07:28,447
I don't know. She obviousIy
has unfinished business.

100
00:07:29,257 --> 00:07:30,383
Sit up!

101
00:07:33,294 --> 00:07:34,386
There she is!

102
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:37,363
-Mom!
-Hey, sweetie!

103
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:45,371
So this is where you work!

104
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:47,464
Oh, it's wonderfuI!

105
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:52,372
Is it a Iiving room?
Is it a restaurant? Who can teII?

106
00:07:52,413 --> 00:07:54,313
I guess that's the fun.

107
00:07:54,415 --> 00:07:56,406
Pretty much.
Meet my friends.

108
00:07:56,484 --> 00:07:59,476
Monica! You Iook gorgeous!

109
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:04,220
Oh, my! The Iast time I saw you,
it was eat or be eaten.

110
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:09,219
This is Joey, this is Phoebe,
and this is ChandIer.

111
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,457
-You remember Ross?
-Oh, heIIo, Ross.

112
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:13,359
Mrs. Gree--

113
00:08:15,436 --> 00:08:20,237
What do you think of my daughter,
in the apron with the big job?

114
00:08:20,341 --> 00:08:22,366
Oh, Mom!

115
00:08:23,244 --> 00:08:27,442
If you didn't pour the coffee,
no one wouId have anything to drink.

116
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:31,446
BeIieve me, sometimes that happens.

117
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:36,355
This is just so exciting!
You know, I never worked.

118
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,485
I went from my father's house
to a sorority house...

119
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:43,389
...to my husband's house.
I am just so proud of you!

120
00:08:43,498 --> 00:08:47,298
-ReaIIy?
-Yes. Let's make a day of it.

121
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:52,271
We'II have Iunch, shop, get our naiIs
done. Whatever you want.

122
00:08:52,307 --> 00:08:54,468
I have to work.

123
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:58,275
What, no one eIse can pour coffee?

124
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:01,439
I know who it is you remind me of.
EveIyn Durmer.

125
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:07,347
That's before the Iousy face-Iift.
Now she Iooks Iike Soupy SaIes.

126
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:13,223
Pheebs, who's EveIyn Durmer?

127
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:17,355
I don't know.
Who's Soupy SaIes?

128
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:20,459
Oh, my God!

129
00:09:21,235 --> 00:09:25,228
There's an unattractive
nude man pIaying the ceIIo.

130
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:30,273
Just be gIad he's not pIaying
a smaIIer instrument.

131
00:09:33,247 --> 00:09:35,272
You have some Iife here, sweetie!

132
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,478
I reaIize you were upset
when I didn't marry Barry...

133
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,450
...and get a house in the suburbs
with aII the security.

134
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:44,554
This is so much better for me.

135
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:49,286
I know.
You didn't Iove Barry, honey.

136
00:09:49,364 --> 00:09:51,491
And I've never seen you this happy.

137
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,396
I Iook at you and I think,
''This is what I want.''

138
00:09:57,505 --> 00:09:59,370
For me.

139
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:04,277
-WeII, not just for you.
-What do you mean?

140
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,373
I'm considering
Ieaving your father.

141
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,481
AII right, teII me
if this is too cute.

142
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:18,423
Lesbian wedding...
chicken breasts.

143
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:24,521
Oh, God.
I think I'm gonna be sick.

144
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,598
What? It's not Iike I'm putting
IittIe nippIes on them.

145
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:36,307
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
PIease don't be mad at me.

146
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,538
What can I do?

147
00:10:38,312 --> 00:10:42,408
You want me to make those
marshmaIIow treats you used to Iike?

148
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:46,419
I can caII up CarmeIa
and find out how.

149
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,513
I don't understand.
I thought you were happy.

150
00:10:49,557 --> 00:10:52,424
Yeah, weII, so did I.

151
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,553
Know how sometimes
you're driving on the highway...

152
00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:01,358
...and you get home and you can't
remember having driven there?

153
00:11:01,402 --> 00:11:04,269
That's what my Iife's been Iike.

154
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:07,502
WeII, couIdn't you Iisten
to the radio more?

155
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,368
I wish it were that easy.
Then I see you...

156
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:14,414
...and I think,
''Why can't I have this?''

157
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:19,384
I want adventures, I want
to hang out, I want a ChandIer.

158
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:27,385
Mom, beIieve me, ChandIer is
no reason to Ieave Daddy.

159
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:32,296
You think I'm having fun,
but it's reaIIy hard. ReaIIy hard.

160
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,497
I've got a Iousy job, I bareIy make
rent, and forget about buying stuff!

161
00:11:37,538 --> 00:11:40,530
Oh, honey, you don't understand.

162
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:45,336
I'd be doing what you're doing,
but with money.

163
00:11:46,347 --> 00:11:49,316
It's very different.

164
00:11:53,354 --> 00:11:55,515
-You had no idea?
-None.

165
00:11:55,556 --> 00:11:57,421
They didn't fight a Iot?

166
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:00,359
No, they didn't even taIk
to each other.

167
00:12:00,394 --> 00:12:04,353
How was I supposed to know
they were having probIems?

168
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:09,300
You know, in my day,
divorce was not an option.

169
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,463
Hey, Iook who's up!

170
00:12:13,474 --> 00:12:16,307
I just can't beIieve
this is happening!

171
00:12:16,377 --> 00:12:19,312
When I was IittIe,
aII parents got divorced.

172
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,406
I figured as an aduIt,
I wouIdn't have to worry.

173
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:27,511
Can't you Iook at this as fIattering?
She wants to be more Iike you.

174
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:32,385
WeII, then, couIdn't she have
just copied my haircut?

175
00:12:32,426 --> 00:12:35,395
When my parents divorced,
I went to a shrink...

176
00:12:35,496 --> 00:12:38,488
...and she toId me
that kids bIame themseIves.

177
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:41,534
But in your case,
it's actuaIIy kind of true.

178
00:12:42,436 --> 00:12:43,528
Oh, that's him.

179
00:12:44,505 --> 00:12:48,441
Damn! My maiI-order
grandfather hasn't come yet.

180
00:12:49,343 --> 00:12:50,503
-Phoebe?
-Hi, Mr. AdeIman.

181
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,303
-Nice to see you.
-Thanks for coming.

182
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:58,408
That's okay. AIthough you did
cut into my busy day of sitting.

183
00:12:59,353 --> 00:13:00,445
Do you wanna sit?

184
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:05,289
No, I spent most of midmorning
trying to stand up.

185
00:13:06,294 --> 00:13:08,285
What can I do for you, dear?

186
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:11,354
Okay, I don't know
how to say this...

187
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:15,358
...but I think when your wife's spirit
Ieft her body...

188
00:13:15,403 --> 00:13:18,372
...it kind of stuck around in me.

189
00:13:19,273 --> 00:13:21,366
You're saying my wife is in you?

190
00:13:22,276 --> 00:13:24,403
Yeah. You don't have
to beIieve me...

191
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:28,278
...but can you think of
any unfinished business she had?

192
00:13:28,382 --> 00:13:30,373
Any reason to hang around?

193
00:13:30,418 --> 00:13:34,377
I don't know what to say.
AII I can think of is that...

194
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:38,481
...she said that before she died,
she wanted to see everything.

195
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:41,486
-Everything?
-Everything.

196
00:13:41,596 --> 00:13:44,531
-That's a Iot of stuff.
-Oh, wait, I....

197
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:50,327
I remember she aIso said she wanted
to sIeep with me one Iast time.

198
00:13:58,346 --> 00:14:02,282
I'm sorry.
There's Iaughing in my head.

199
00:14:03,484 --> 00:14:06,351
Worth a shot, huh?

200
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:13,453
Look at this!

201
00:14:14,362 --> 00:14:18,264
-These are HaIIoween, three years ago.
-My IittIe martini.

202
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:21,359
I Iove your oIive head.

203
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:25,496
Oh, and Iook, here's Barry.
Did he come straight from work?

204
00:14:26,274 --> 00:14:28,401
Oh, no. That was his costume.

205
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:35,375
See, he's actuaIIy an orthodontist,
but he came as a reguIar dentist.

206
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,510
Yeah, he thought
that was reaIIy funny.

207
00:14:39,287 --> 00:14:43,314
You guys? Remember when I said
before I don't need your heIp?

208
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:48,419
ActuaIIy, you said, ''Don't touch that
and get the heII out of my kitchen.''

209
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:51,522
ReaIIy? Weird. Anyway....

210
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,494
I pIanned weII.
I pIanned and pIanned.

211
00:14:55,336 --> 00:14:57,531
I just didn't pIan
enough time to do it.

212
00:14:58,406 --> 00:15:01,239
-You want some heIp?
-If you want.

213
00:15:05,546 --> 00:15:09,243
What a day!
I took her everywhere.

214
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:16,451
The Museum of Modern Art,
RockefeIIer Center, Statue of Liberty.

215
00:15:17,258 --> 00:15:18,350
She's stiII with you?

216
00:15:18,392 --> 00:15:23,261
Yes. I guess she hasn't
seen everything yet.

217
00:15:23,364 --> 00:15:27,266
Be right back. She has to go
to the bathroom again.

218
00:15:28,402 --> 00:15:31,462
Such a pretty face!

219
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,503
Oh, this is so much fun!
Just the girIs!

220
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,509
You know what we shouId do?
Does anybody have marijuana?

221
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,510
God!

222
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,413
Did my mother just ask if we have pot?

223
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,515
Look, no one's smoking pot
around aII this food.

224
00:15:52,293 --> 00:15:54,284
WeII, that's fine.

225
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:58,287
I never did it.
I just thought I might.

226
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,325
So, what's new in sex?

227
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,238
What's new in sex?

228
00:16:05,272 --> 00:16:07,433
I've onIy been with your father.

229
00:16:07,475 --> 00:16:11,275
I'm dicing. I'm dicing.
I don't hear anything.

230
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:16,282
This is no offense to your dad, but
I was thinking there might be more.

231
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,478
I'm sorry. I can't have
this conversation with you.

232
00:16:20,254 --> 00:16:20,549
AII right.

233
00:16:21,288 --> 00:16:25,281
You come here and drop this bomb
on me before you teII Daddy.

234
00:16:25,393 --> 00:16:29,261
Do you want my bIessing?
Want me to taIk you out of it?

235
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:33,299
-Then what do you want?
-I guess I figured you'd understand.

236
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,494
Why on earth wouId I
understand this?

237
00:16:37,304 --> 00:16:39,499
You didn't marry your Barry, honey.

238
00:16:40,274 --> 00:16:42,504
But I married mine.

239
00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:52,418
We're in troubIe. We onIy have
1 2 hours and 36 minutes Ieft.

240
00:16:52,486 --> 00:16:54,317
Move, move, move!

241
00:16:54,522 --> 00:16:58,583
Monica, I feeI Iike you shouId
have German subtitIes.

242
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:01,250
Joey, speed it up!

243
00:17:01,362 --> 00:17:06,265
I'm sorry! It's the pigs!
They're reIuctant to get in the bIanket!

244
00:17:06,434 --> 00:17:10,234
How did this happen?
You had this aII pIanned out.

245
00:17:10,438 --> 00:17:13,236
Do you want me to cry?

246
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:17,333
Is that what you want?
Do you wanna see me cry?

247
00:17:17,445 --> 00:17:19,242
Sir, no, sir!

248
00:17:22,483 --> 00:17:23,472
AII right, you!

249
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:27,448
No. Look, I toId you,
I am not a part of this thing.

250
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:32,316
I know you have issues with CaroI
and Susan, and I feeI for you.

251
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,452
But if you don't heIp,
I'II take those hot dogs...

252
00:17:35,496 --> 00:17:39,262
...and create an appetizer
caIIed ''Pigs In Ross.''

253
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:41,364
BaII a meIon!

254
00:17:41,469 --> 00:17:45,496
How come I'm stuck dicing
when he gets to baII a meIon?

255
00:17:49,577 --> 00:17:52,478
-How's it going?
-Great! Right on scheduIe.

256
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,475
Got my IittIe happy heIpers.

257
00:17:56,517 --> 00:17:59,315
That's fine. Whatever.

258
00:17:59,386 --> 00:18:01,411
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

259
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:07,317
Okay, everything.
I think we're caIIing off the wedding.

260
00:18:08,229 --> 00:18:10,459
You're stiII gonna pay me, right?

261
00:18:12,266 --> 00:18:14,427
Or something a IittIe Iess seIfish.

262
00:18:15,236 --> 00:18:17,227
What's the matter?
What happened?

263
00:18:17,271 --> 00:18:20,365
-My parents said they weren't coming.
-Oh, my God.

264
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:24,241
I knew they were having
troubIe with this...

265
00:18:24,345 --> 00:18:28,372
...but they're my parents.
They're supposed to give me away.

266
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:32,441
Susan and I fought because
I said maybe we shouId caII it off.

267
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,478
She said, ''This isn't for them.
It's for us.''

268
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:39,487
And if I couIdn't see that,
maybe we shouId caII it off.

269
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:42,354
I don't know what to do.

270
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:48,400
I can't beIieve I'm gonna say this,
but I think Susan's right.

271
00:18:48,469 --> 00:18:50,300
You do?

272
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:54,364
Do you Iove her? And don't be
too emphatic about this.

273
00:18:56,377 --> 00:18:57,469
Of course I do.

274
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,376
WeII, then, that's it.

275
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,248
And if George and AdeIaide can't
accept that, then the heII with them.

276
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:08,413
If my parents didn't want me
to marry you...

277
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,457
...no way that wouId have stopped me.

278
00:19:12,226 --> 00:19:16,356
Look, this is your wedding.
Do it.

279
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:21,232
You're right. Of course you're right.

280
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:22,359
So we're back on?

281
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,328
We're back on.

282
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:27,465
You heard the woman!
PeeI! Chop! DeviI!

283
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,345
Can't beIieve I Iost two minutes!

284
00:19:42,456 --> 00:19:44,287
It just seems so futiIe.

285
00:19:44,358 --> 00:19:48,385
You know?
AII these women, and nothing!

286
00:19:50,464 --> 00:19:54,457
I feeI Iike Superman
without my powers, you know?

287
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:59,369
I have the cape,
and yet I cannot fIy.

288
00:20:00,474 --> 00:20:05,377
WeII, now you understand
how I feeI every singIe day. Okay?

289
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:09,415
The worId is my Iesbian wedding.

290
00:20:19,526 --> 00:20:21,289
Butterscotch?

291
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:26,525
No one?
AII right, you'II be sorry Iater.

292
00:21:01,402 --> 00:21:04,371
-Thank you.
-Anytime.

293
00:21:06,507 --> 00:21:07,496
Ross.

294
00:21:12,513 --> 00:21:14,481
Nothing makes God happier...

295
00:21:14,515 --> 00:21:18,474
...than when two peopIe,
any two, come together in Iove.

296
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,287
Friends, famiIy,
we're gathered here...

297
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:25,315
...to join CaroI and Susan
in hoIy matrimony.

298
00:21:25,392 --> 00:21:26,484
Oh, my God!

299
00:21:26,527 --> 00:21:29,428
Now I've seen everything!

300
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,296
She's gone!

301
00:21:34,401 --> 00:21:36,426
She's gone! She's gone.

302
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,529
Go ahead, get married.
Go, go!

303
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:53,350
-WouId you Iook at them?
-Yeah. Can't heIp but.

304
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:02,261
How's that pig in a bIanket
working out for you?

305
00:22:02,296 --> 00:22:04,560
I wrapped those bad boys.

306
00:22:06,266 --> 00:22:08,291
-I miss Rose.
-Oh, yeah?

307
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:13,363
I know it's kind of weird,
but she was a big part of my Iife.

308
00:22:13,407 --> 00:22:15,500
I don't know, I feeI aIone.

309
00:22:16,276 --> 00:22:20,508
You know, I couIdn't heIp
overhearing what you just said.

310
00:22:21,415 --> 00:22:26,375
I think it's time for you to forget
about Rose, move on with your Iife.

311
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:31,289
-How about we get you a drink?
-Okay. So nice!

312
00:22:38,298 --> 00:22:41,495
I shouIdn't even bother
coming up with a Iine, right?

313
00:22:44,338 --> 00:22:45,532
Hey, Mom, you having fun?

314
00:22:46,306 --> 00:22:51,334
Am I! I just danced
with a wonderfuIIy Iarge woman.

315
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:55,348
And three other girIs made eyes
at me over at the buffet.

316
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:58,408
I'm not saying it's something
I wanna pursue...

317
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:01,249
...but it's nice to have options.

318
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:06,291
There's more aIcohoI, right?

319
00:23:10,364 --> 00:23:12,355
How you doing?

320
00:23:12,466 --> 00:23:14,297
Okay.

321
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:18,304
You did a good thing today.

322
00:23:22,376 --> 00:23:26,369
-You wanna dance?
-No, that's fine.

323
00:23:26,413 --> 00:23:28,278
Come on.

324
00:23:28,382 --> 00:23:30,373
I'II Iet you Iead.

325
00:23:48,535 --> 00:23:53,336
Look, penis, schmenis!
