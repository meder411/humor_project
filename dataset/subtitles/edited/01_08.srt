1
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:09,366
Hey, gorgeous! How's it going?

2
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:11,342
Dehydrated Japanese noodles

3
00:00:11,342 --> 00:00:13,242
under fluorescent lights.

4
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,280
Does it get better than this?

5
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:17,539
Question: Are you dating anyone?

6
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,818
I met somebody who would be

7
00:00:19,818 --> 00:00:21,285
perfect for you.

8
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:23,445
Perfect might be a problem.

9
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:25,821
Had you said codependent

10
00:00:25,821 --> 00:00:27,385
or self-destructive....

11
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,811
You want a date Saturday?

12
00:00:29,811 --> 00:00:31,261
Yes, please.

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,457
He is cute.

14
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,882
He's funny. He's--

15
00:00:34,882 --> 00:00:36,264
He's a he?

16
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,461
Well, yeah.

17
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:40,398
Oh, God! I just--

18
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:42,568
You're nice-- Oh, God.

19
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,327
Good, Shelly. I'm gonna flush myself

20
00:00:45,327 --> 00:00:47,278
down the toilet now.

21
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,369
Okay. Bye-bye.

22
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,532
It's hard to enjoy noodles

23
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:41,500
after that. Is that ridiculous?

24
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:43,786
Can you believe she actually

25
00:01:43,786 --> 00:01:45,270
thought that?

26
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,269
Yeah.

27
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,356
When I first met you,

28
00:01:51,356 --> 00:01:55,372
I thought maybe possibly you might be.

29
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:57,371
You did?

30
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:59,349
You spent Phoebe's birthday

31
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:03,255
party talking to my breasts so I figured maybe not.

32
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:06,892
Did any of the rest of you guys

33
00:02:06,892 --> 00:02:09,360
think that when you first met me?

34
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,396
I did.

35
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:11,363
I think so, yeah.

36
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:14,395
Not me.

37
00:02:14,395 --> 00:02:15,424
No, no, me neither.

38
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:17,899
Although back in college,

39
00:02:17,899 --> 00:02:19,429
Susan Saladore did.

40
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:21,365
You're kidding.

41
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,237
Did you tell her I wasn't?

42
00:02:23,237 --> 00:02:24,232
No.

43
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,246
I wanted to go out with her too.

44
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,828
I told her you were seeing

45
00:02:29,828 --> 00:02:35,346
Bernie Spellman...who also liked her.

46
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:42,361
Well, this is fascinating.

47
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,490
So what is it about me?

48
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,961
I don't know.

49
00:02:46,961 --> 00:02:48,457
You're smart, you're funny....

50
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,315
So is Ross.

51
00:02:50,315 --> 00:02:51,361
Ever think that about him?

52
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,937
Yeah, right!

53
00:02:52,937 --> 00:02:54,370
What is it?

54
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,905
I don't know. You just--

55
00:02:57,905 --> 00:02:59,401
You have a quality.

56
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,911
Yes, exactly.

57
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:02,310
Yeah, a quality.

58
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,212
''A quality.'' Good. I was worried you

59
00:03:05,212 --> 00:03:07,208
were gonna be vague about this.

60
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,448
I think this is gonna work for you.

61
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:12,236
Excuse me?

62
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:13,248
Sure, sure.

63
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,823
Women find you less threatening,

64
00:03:15,823 --> 00:03:21,458
they let their guards down you're like a stealth heterosexual.

65
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:34,913
It's Paolo calling from Rome.

66
00:03:34,913 --> 00:03:37,381
Oh, my God! Calling from Rome!

67
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:43,951
So he's calling from Rome.

68
00:03:43,951 --> 00:03:45,447
I could do that.

69
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,452
Just gotta go to Rome.

70
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,859
Your Dad just beeped in.

71
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:53,355
Can you make it quick?

72
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,297
I'm talking to Rome.

73
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,463
I'm talking to Rome.

74
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,233
Hey, Dad. What's up?

75
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,332
Oh, God.

76
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,337
Ross, it's Nana.

77
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,274
How you doing?

78
00:04:19,274 --> 00:04:20,224
Hey, Dad.

79
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,453
So how is she doing?

80
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,830
The doctor says

81
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,229
it's a matter of hours.

82
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,884
How are you, Mom?

83
00:04:29,884 --> 00:04:31,334
Me? I'm fine, fine.

84
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,428
I'm glad you're here.

85
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,808
What's with your hair?

86
00:04:36,808 --> 00:04:38,241
What?

87
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:39,456
What's different?

88
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:40,468
Nothing.

89
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,372
Oh, maybe that's it.

90
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,846
She's unbelievable. Her mother's--

91
00:04:45,846 --> 00:04:47,342
Okay, relax.

92
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,478
We're gonna be here a while.

93
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,820
We still have boyfriends

94
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,350
and your career to cover.

95
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,451
Oh, God!

96
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,268
The fuzzy little mints

97
00:05:03,268 --> 00:05:05,202
at the bottom of her purse.

98
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,497
Yeah, they were gross.

99
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,409
You know what I love?

100
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,411
Her Sweet 'N Lows.

101
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,328
How she was always stealing them

102
00:05:14,328 --> 00:05:16,211
from restaurants.

103
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,812
Not just from restaurants,

104
00:05:17,812 --> 00:05:19,308
from our house.

105
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,220
Mrs. Geller?

106
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,256
She looks so small.

107
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,417
I know.

108
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,347
Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop

109
00:05:32,347 --> 00:05:34,264
and Aunt Phylis now.

110
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,268
Aunt Phylis is dead?

111
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,361
Yeah, for like six years.

112
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,905
Where were--?

113
00:05:40,905 --> 00:05:43,339
Can we focus, please?

114
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,344
Goodbye, Nana.

115
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,292
Bye, Nana.

116
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,326
Nurse!

117
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,297
What is going on?

118
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,337
You know how the nurse said

119
00:06:15,337 --> 00:06:16,434
Nana had passed?

120
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:18,403
Well, she's not quite.

121
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,245
What?

122
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,281
She's not passed!

123
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:25,215
She's present! She's back!

124
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,409
What's going on?

125
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,350
She may have died.

126
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,414
She may have died?

127
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,418
We're looking into it.

128
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,420
I'll go see.

129
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,365
This almost never happens.

130
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,219
Now she's passed.

131
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,193
I just have to know, okay?

132
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:13,423
Is it my hair?

133
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,796
Yes, that's exactly what it is.

134
00:07:15,796 --> 00:07:17,292
It's your hair.

135
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,428
Yeah, you have homosexual hair.

136
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,209
So did she...?

137
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,211
Twice.

138
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,380
Twice?

139
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,443
Oh, that sucks.

140
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,735
You guys okay?

141
00:07:37,735 --> 00:07:39,248
I don't know. It's weird.

142
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,939
I know she's gone,

143
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:42,520
but I just don't feel....

144
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,263
Maybe she's not really gone.

145
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,525
No, no, she's gone.

146
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,264
We checked.

147
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,426
A lot.

148
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:53,353
No, I mean, maybe no one

149
00:07:53,353 --> 00:07:54,468
ever really goes.

150
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,758
Ever since my mom died,

151
00:07:56,758 --> 00:08:00,261
every now and then I get this feeling that she's

152
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:02,178
right here, you know?

153
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,248
And Debbie, my friend

154
00:08:07,248 --> 00:08:10,321
from junior high got struck by lightning

155
00:08:10,321 --> 00:08:12,221
on a miniature golf course.

156
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,338
I always get this strong

157
00:08:14,338 --> 00:08:18,288
Debbie vibe when I use a little yellow pencil.

158
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:24,898
I miss her.

159
00:08:24,898 --> 00:08:26,394
Here, Pheebs.

160
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,195
Want this?

161
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:29,302
Oh, thanks.

162
00:08:29,302 --> 00:08:30,297
Sure.

163
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,402
I just sharpened her this morning.

164
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:36,710
I don't believe any of that.

165
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,830
When you're dead you're dead. You're gone.

166
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,343
You're worm food.

167
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,226
So Chandler looks gay, huh?

168
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,748
I don't know who this is,

169
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:54,232
but it's not Debbie.

170
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,175
Dad, let's just make a decision.

171
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,743
You're right.

172
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:06,210
It's going into the ground.

173
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,180
We should get the most basic thing.

174
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,712
''The non-protective corrugated

175
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:14,209
fiberboard with white laminate.''

176
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,287
Dad, we can't bury Nana

177
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,187
in a dresser from Ikea.

178
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,887
This is why your mother

179
00:09:19,887 --> 00:09:21,383
buys my clothes.

180
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:24,419
I hate to shop. I hate it.

181
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:26,294
Isn't this more about

182
00:09:26,294 --> 00:09:29,867
the fact that once you decide, it's like

183
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:32,301
acknowledging Nana's actually gone?

184
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,433
No, I really hate to shop.

185
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:44,331
I thought it'd be a closed casket.

186
00:09:44,331 --> 00:09:47,215
It doesn't mean she can't look nice.

187
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:53,321
Sweetie, you think

188
00:09:53,321 --> 00:09:54,418
you can get in there?

189
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,421
I don't see why not.

190
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:17,442
Here's my retainer.

191
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,428
I was just thinking when my time comes--

192
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:30,395
Dad.

193
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,259
Listen to me.

194
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,434
When my time comes,

195
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,402
I wanna be buried at sea.

196
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,295
You what?

197
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,787
I wanna be buried at sea.

198
00:10:43,787 --> 00:10:45,300
It looks like fun.

199
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,505
Define ''fun.''

200
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,277
Come on. You'll make a day of it.

201
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:53,273
You'll get a boat, pack a lunch....

202
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,449
And then we throw your body in

203
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:57,479
the water. Gee, that does sound fun.

204
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,372
Everyone thinks they know me.

205
00:11:00,372 --> 00:11:02,454
Everyone says I'm so predictable.

206
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,345
Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say,

207
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:07,461
''Buried at sea? Huh?''

208
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,329
That's probably what they'll say.

209
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,337
I'd like that.

210
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,399
Hey, gorgeous.

211
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,445
Hey.

212
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:32,457
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.

213
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,924
Don't worry. Apparently, other people

214
00:11:34,924 --> 00:11:37,290
have made the same mistake.

215
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,298
Okay. Phew!

216
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,464
So, what do you think it is about me?

217
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,268
I don't know what.

218
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:51,371
You just have a quality.

219
00:11:51,371 --> 00:11:52,366
A quality. Great.

220
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,429
It's a shame. You and Lowell

221
00:11:54,429 --> 00:11:56,380
would've made a great couple.

222
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,313
Lowell? Financial Services Lowell?

223
00:12:00,313 --> 00:12:02,309
That's who you saw me with?

224
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,410
What? He's cute.

225
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,315
Well, yeah.

226
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,415
He's no Brian in Payroll.

227
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:11,418
Is Brian--?

228
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,727
I don't know. If you

229
00:12:13,727 --> 00:12:16,847
were gonna set me up I'd like to think it'd be

230
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:18,360
with somebody like him.

231
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:21,338
Brian's a little out of your league.

232
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,341
Excuse me. You don't think

233
00:12:28,341 --> 00:12:30,337
I could get a Brian?

234
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,865
Because I could get a Brian.

235
00:12:34,865 --> 00:12:36,378
Believe you me.

236
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:39,449
I'm really not.

237
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,351
This one?

238
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:49,263
I've shown you every dress we have.

239
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,381
Unless you want her to spend eternity

240
00:12:51,381 --> 00:12:55,497
in a lemon-yellow pantsuit go with the burgundy.

241
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:57,955
Whatever we pick, she'd say

242
00:12:57,955 --> 00:12:59,502
it's the wrong one.

243
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,237
Right. We'll go with the burgundy.

244
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:05,249
A fine choice. I'm coming out.

245
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,216
Wait! We need shoes.

246
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,327
How about these?

247
00:13:17,327 --> 00:13:19,227
That's really a day shoe.

248
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:20,827
Where she's going

249
00:13:20,827 --> 00:13:22,323
everyone else will be dressier?

250
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,885
Could we see something

251
00:13:24,885 --> 00:13:26,335
in a slimmer heel?

252
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,256
I have nothing in an evening shoe

253
00:13:33,256 --> 00:13:35,269
in the burgundy.

254
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,744
I can show you something

255
00:13:37,744 --> 00:13:39,240
silver that may work.

256
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,351
No, it really should be burgundy.

257
00:13:42,351 --> 00:13:44,450
Unless we go with a different dress.

258
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,554
No, no, no. Watch this.

259
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:48,823
Wait, I may have something

260
00:13:48,823 --> 00:13:50,353
in the back.

261
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,300
Oh, my God.

262
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,405
Is everything all right?

263
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,407
Just Nana's stuff.

264
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,265
You guys ready?

265
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,853
Mom called to tell me

266
00:14:31,853 --> 00:14:33,337
not to wear my hair up.

267
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,890
Know my ears aren't my best feature?

268
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,341
Some days it's all I can think about.

269
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,808
I'm sorry I'm late.

270
00:14:40,808 --> 00:14:42,338
I couldn't find my bearings.

271
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,346
You mean your earrings?

272
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,246
What did I say?

273
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,868
Are these the shoes?

274
00:14:49,868 --> 00:14:51,449
Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.

275
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,250
What? We don't have shoes here?

276
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,247
Morning. We ready to go?

277
00:14:59,247 --> 00:15:01,198
Don't we look nice all dressed up?

278
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,227
It's stuff like that, isn't it?

279
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,380
It was a really beautiful service.

280
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,245
It really was.

281
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,414
Come here, sweetheart.

282
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,839
You know, I think it's time for you

283
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,319
to start using night cream.

284
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,369
What?

285
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,854
Nothing. Just that your coat

286
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:44,237
sounds like Brent Musberger.

287
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,361
Check it out. Giants-Cowboys.

288
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:50,279
You're watching football at a funeral?

289
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,333
No, it's the pre-game.

290
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,284
I'm gonna watch it at the reception.

291
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,380
You're a frightening, frightening man.

292
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,382
Oh, no! My new Paolo shoes!

293
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,422
I hope they're not ruined.

294
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,232
God, what a great day!

295
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,194
What? Weather-wise.

296
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,432
I know.

297
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,435
The air, the trees.

298
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,341
Even though Nana's gone,

299
00:16:21,341 --> 00:16:23,337
there's something almost life--

300
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,351
Ross, are you okay?

301
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,216
No, I'm fine.

302
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,337
Just having my worst fear

303
00:16:33,337 --> 00:16:34,417
realized, but....

304
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:43,998
I'm just checking to see

305
00:16:43,998 --> 00:16:45,528
if the muscle's in spasm.

306
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,823
What? What is it?

307
00:16:48,823 --> 00:16:50,273
You missed a belt loop.

308
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,369
Okay, it's in spasm.

309
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,443
Here, sweetie. I took these

310
00:16:57,443 --> 00:16:59,439
when I had my gall thing accident.

311
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,379
Thanks, Mom.

312
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,386
Sorry.

313
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,195
Hi, I'm Andrea.

314
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,300
I'm Dorothy's daughter.

315
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,318
Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have

316
00:17:17,318 --> 00:17:19,235
no idea who Dorothy is.

317
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:23,400
Look who's up!

318
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,245
How do you feel?

319
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:29,213
I feel great.

320
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,441
I feel great. I feel great.

321
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,344
Wow, those pills really worked.

322
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:37,972
Yeah. Not the first two,

323
00:17:37,972 --> 00:17:39,422
but the second two....

324
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,228
I love you guys.

325
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,332
You guys are the greatest.

326
00:17:48,332 --> 00:17:50,232
I love my sister.

327
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,360
I love Pheebs.

328
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,430
That's so nice.

329
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:58,365
I love you, man.

330
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:01,775
And listen,

331
00:18:01,775 --> 00:18:03,271
if you wanna be gay, be gay!

332
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,412
It doesn't matter to me.

333
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,377
You were right.

334
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,396
I do love you.

335
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,333
Oh, Ross. I love you too.

336
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,433
Oh, no, I really love you.

337
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,211
I really love you.

338
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,408
Oh, you don't get it!

339
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,325
What do you got there?

340
00:18:49,325 --> 00:18:51,424
Just a hearing disability.

341
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,256
What's the score?

342
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,847
1 7-1 4, Giants.

343
00:18:56,847 --> 00:18:58,360
Three minutes to go in the third.

344
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,437
Beautiful!

345
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,280
Pheebs, could you maybe

346
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,180
hand me a cracker?

347
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,184
Your grandmother would've hated this.

348
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:18,906
Sure. What with it being

349
00:19:18,906 --> 00:19:20,390
her funeral and all.

350
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:26,780
No, I'd be hearing about why didn't I get

351
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,230
the honey-glazed ham.

352
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,267
Or I didn't spend enough on flowers.

353
00:19:30,267 --> 00:19:32,201
Or she'd say:

354
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:33,851
''Why waste your money?

355
00:19:33,851 --> 00:19:35,398
I don't need flowers, I'm dead.''

356
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,241
That sounds like Nana.

357
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,827
Do you know what it's like

358
00:19:40,827 --> 00:19:44,847
to grow up with someone who is critical

359
00:19:44,847 --> 00:19:47,247
of every single thing you say?

360
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,216
I can imagine.

361
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:53,791
It's a wonder your mother

362
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:57,278
turned out to be the positive,

363
00:19:57,278 --> 00:19:59,229
life-affirming person she is.

364
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,323
That is a wonder.

365
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,336
So tell me something, Mom.

366
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:11,738
If you had to do it all over again I mean, if she was here

367
00:20:11,738 --> 00:20:15,278
right now would you tell her?

368
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,347
Tell her what?

369
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:19,916
How she drove you crazy,

370
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,350
picking on every little detail.

371
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,388
Like your hair, for example.

372
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,308
I'm not sure I know

373
00:20:27,308 --> 00:20:29,259
what you're getting at.

374
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,410
Would things have been better

375
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,458
if you'd just told her the truth?

376
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,366
Some things are better left unsaid.

377
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:46,410
It's nicer when people just get along.

378
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,473
More wine?

379
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:53,478
Oh, I think so.

380
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:02,976
Those earrings look

381
00:21:02,976 --> 00:21:04,426
really lovely on you.

382
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,228
Thank you.

383
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,258
They're yours.

384
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,261
Actually, they were Nana's.

385
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,376
Now I'm depressed!

386
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,274
Even more than I was.

387
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,386
Oh, look. My first grade picture.

388
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,396
Please ignore the Dy-no-mite T-shirt.

389
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,898
Hey, who's this little naked guy?

390
00:21:41,898 --> 00:21:44,298
That little naked guy would be me.

391
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,401
Look at the little thing!

392
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,825
Yes, fine.

393
00:21:51,825 --> 00:21:53,275
That is my penis.

394
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,480
Can we be grownups now?

395
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:57,473
Who are those people?

396
00:21:58,283 --> 00:21:59,847
Got me.

397
00:21:59,847 --> 00:22:01,411
That's Nana right there in the middle.

398
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:03,445
Yeah, let's see.

399
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,451
''Me and the gang at Java Joe's.''

400
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,823
You look just like your grandmother.

401
00:22:08,823 --> 00:22:10,421
How old was she?

402
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,463
Let's see, ''1 939.''

403
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,230
Twenty-four, twenty-five.

404
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,269
It looks like a fun gang.

405
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:25,755
Look, look, look!

406
00:22:25,755 --> 00:22:27,268
I got Monica naked!

407
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,472
Let me see!

408
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:33,342
No, no. That would be me again.

409
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,382
I'm just trying something.

410
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,270
Hey, Lowell.

411
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:53,462
Oh, hey, Chandler.

412
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:56,973
So how's it going in

413
00:22:56,973 --> 00:22:58,372
Financial Services?

414
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,342
It's like Mardi Gras without

415
00:23:00,342 --> 00:23:02,207
the papier-mâché heads.

416
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,303
How about you?

417
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:08,815
Good. Good. Listen...I don't know what Shelly told you

418
00:23:08,815 --> 00:23:13,220
about me, but...I'm not.

419
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,318
I know. That's what I told her.

420
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,224
Really?

421
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,231
So you can tell?

422
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,248
Pretty much. Most of the time.

423
00:23:25,248 --> 00:23:27,261
We have a kind of radar.

424
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:32,367
So you don't think I have a quality?

425
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,860
Speaking for my people,

426
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,475
I'd have to say no.

427
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:40,914
By the way, your friend Brian,

428
00:23:40,914 --> 00:23:42,444
from Payroll? He is.

429
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:44,884
He is?

430
00:23:44,884 --> 00:23:46,380
And way out of your league.

431
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:51,454
Out of my league!

432
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:53,930
I could get a Brian. If I wanted to

433
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:56,364
get a Brian, I could get a Brian.

434
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,368
Hey, Brian.
