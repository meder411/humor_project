1
00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:03,364
Everybody! Central Perk

2
00:00:03,364 --> 00:00:09,431
is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.

4
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,277
Thanks.

5
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:15,363
I wanna start with a song

6
00:00:15,363 --> 00:00:19,398
that's about that moment when you suddenly realize

8
00:00:19,398 --> 00:00:21,446
what life is really all about.

9
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:24,352
Okay, here we go.

10
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:29,453
Okay. Thank you very much.

11
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,502
Oh, great. This is just--

12
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,882
This is so cool, you guys.

13
00:01:42,882 --> 00:01:44,497
The entire city's blacked out.

14
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,789
It's all of Manhattan.

15
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:50,276
They have no idea when it's back on.

17
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:52,389
You guys, this is big.

18
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:54,402
Pants and a sweater. Why, Mom?

19
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,306
Who will I meet in a blackout?

20
00:01:58,384 --> 00:01:59,868
Power-company guys?

21
00:01:59,868 --> 00:02:01,352
Eligible looters?

22
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:03,837
Can we talk about this later? Okay.

23
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:05,452
Can I borrow the phone?

24
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,790
I wanna call my apartment

25
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,354
and check on my grandma.

26
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,226
What's my number?

27
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,433
I never call me.

28
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,332
Oh, my God! It's her.

29
00:02:18,332 --> 00:02:20,328
It's that Victoria's Secret model.

30
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,431
Something Goodacre.

31
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,334
Hi, Mom, it's Jill.

32
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,827
She's right. It's Jill.

33
00:02:25,827 --> 00:02:28,278
Jill Goodacre. Oh, my God!

34
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,316
I am trapped in an ATM vestibule

35
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,284
with Jill Goodacre.

36
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,820
Is it a vestibule?

37
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,287
Maybe it's an atrium.

38
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,407
Yeah, that is the part

39
00:02:38,407 --> 00:02:40,358
to focus on, you idiot.

40
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,390
I'm fine. I'm just stuck

41
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,386
at the bank in an ATM vestibule.

42
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,478
Jill says vestibule,

43
00:02:47,478 --> 00:02:49,491
I'm going with vestibule.

44
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,263
I'm fine. No, I'm not alone.

45
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,372
I don't know, some guy.

46
00:02:56,476 --> 00:03:00,435
Oh, some guy. I am some guy.

47
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,311
Jill, I saw you with some guy

48
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:03,408
last night.

49
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,412
Yes, he was some guy.

50
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,326
Hey, everyone.

51
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,233
Officiating at tonight's blackout

52
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:28,229
is Rabbi Tribbiani.

53
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:33,359
Chandler's old roommate was Jewish.

54
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:35,441
These are our only candles.

55
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,243
So happy Hanukkah!

56
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:40,899
Look! Ugly Naked Guy

57
00:03:40,899 --> 00:03:42,446
lit a bunch of candles.

58
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,254
That had to hurt!

59
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,883
All right, all right!

60
00:03:54,883 --> 00:03:57,886
It's been 1 2 1 /2 minutes and you still haven't said

62
00:03:57,886 --> 00:03:59,370
one word. God!

63
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,337
Do something!

64
00:04:01,337 --> 00:04:03,202
Just make contact. Smile!

65
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,305
There you go.

66
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,309
You're definitely scaring her.

67
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,227
Hello? Oh, hi, Mom.

68
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,326
Mom.

69
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,329
Mom, you're tripping!

70
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:28,780
Dexter's a dog.

71
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,327
The blackout's scaring him.

72
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,853
You'd pee in Dad's shoes too

73
00:04:32,853 --> 00:04:35,236
if you didn't know.

74
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,267
All right, call me back.

75
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:39,939
Mothers.

76
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:40,433
Yeah.

77
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,481
Attaboy! A word.

78
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,347
That wasn't so hard.

79
00:04:45,347 --> 00:04:46,444
Mothers. Yeah!

80
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,453
Mothers. Yeah! Perfect.

81
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,390
Don't smile.

82
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,552
Would you like to call somebody?

83
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,345
Yeah, about 300 guys I went

84
00:04:58,345 --> 00:05:00,228
to high school with.

85
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,236
Yeah, thanks.

86
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:11,756
Hello?

87
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:12,302
It's me.

88
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:14,408
It's Chandler. Are you okay?

89
00:05:14,408 --> 00:05:16,404
Yeah, I'm fine.

90
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:25,247
I'm stuck in an ATM vestibule...with Jill Goodacre.

92
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:27,738
What?

93
00:05:27,738 --> 00:05:34,457
I'm stuck in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre.

96
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,532
I have no idea what you said.

97
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,239
Put Joey on the phone.

98
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,405
What's up, man?

99
00:05:44,405 --> 00:05:52,451
I'm stuck...in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!

102
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,442
Oh, my God!

103
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,818
He's trapped in an ATM vestibule

104
00:05:56,818 --> 00:05:58,348
with Jill Goodacre!

105
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,317
Chandler, listen.

106
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:06,764
Like that thought

107
00:06:06,764 --> 00:06:08,197
never entered my mind.

108
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:12,699
Okay.

109
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:13,193
Somebody.

110
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:14,289
I'll go. I'll go.

111
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:15,239
Okay.

112
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,292
Senior year of college,

113
00:06:17,292 --> 00:06:19,243
on a pool table.

114
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:20,941
Pool table?

115
00:06:20,941 --> 00:06:22,437
That's my sister.

116
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,831
Okay, my weirdest place

117
00:06:25,831 --> 00:06:30,320
would have to be the women's room of the New York

119
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,419
City Public Library.

120
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,341
Oh, my God! What were you

121
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:35,456
doing in a library?

122
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,846
Pheebs, what about you?

123
00:06:39,846 --> 00:06:41,461
Oh, Milwaukee.

124
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,366
It's a really weird place.

125
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,469
Ross?

126
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:55,811
Disneyland, 1 989.

127
00:06:55,811 --> 00:06:57,375
''It's a small world after all.''

128
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,417
No way.

129
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,306
The ride broke down so Carol and I went behind

131
00:07:05,306 --> 00:07:08,190
those mechanical Dutch children.

132
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:10,342
We were asked never to return

133
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:12,390
to the Magic Kingdom.

134
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,403
Let's see, that leaves....

135
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,887
Rachel?

136
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:20,337
Come on, I already went.

137
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:21,321
You did not go.

138
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:22,236
I did.

139
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,309
Tell us. Come on.

140
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,924
All right, the weirdest place

141
00:07:26,924 --> 00:07:34,243
would have to be...the foot of the bed.

143
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,837
Step back!

144
00:07:36,837 --> 00:07:38,253
We have a winner!

145
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,246
This must be what the fridge

146
00:07:49,246 --> 00:07:51,259
looks like with the door closed.

147
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,334
Spooky.

148
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,388
Anybody hungry?

149
00:07:56,388 --> 00:07:58,436
We got a IKlondike...soup.

150
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:01,329
I've never had a relationship

151
00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:03,280
with that kind of passion.

152
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,250
Where you have to have somebody

153
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,184
even in a theme park.

154
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,804
It was the only thing to do

155
00:08:11,804 --> 00:08:13,385
that didn't have a line.

156
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,307
Barry wouldn't even kiss me

157
00:08:17,307 --> 00:08:19,286
on a miniature golf course.

158
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:19,892
Come on.

159
00:08:19,892 --> 00:08:20,386
No.

160
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,866
He said we held up

161
00:08:21,866 --> 00:08:23,299
the people behind us.

162
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,294
You didn't marry him because...?

163
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:29,871
Do you think there are people

164
00:08:29,871 --> 00:08:34,406
that go through life never having that kind of...?

166
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,379
Probably.

167
00:08:35,379 --> 00:08:36,311
Really?

168
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:37,945
I'll tell you something.

169
00:08:37,945 --> 00:08:39,475
Passion is way overrated.

170
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:40,833
Yeah, right.

171
00:08:40,833 --> 00:08:41,413
It is.

172
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,321
Eventually, it kind of burns out.

173
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,937
But hopefully what you're left

174
00:08:46,937 --> 00:08:49,417
with is trust and security and....

175
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:50,457
In my ex-wife's case,

176
00:08:50,457 --> 00:08:51,452
lesbianism.

177
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,404
For those people who miss out

178
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:03,272
on that passion thing there's other stuff.

180
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,841
Okay.

181
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:08,371
But I don't think that'll be you.

182
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,282
You don't?

183
00:09:11,282 --> 00:09:14,799
See, I see big passion in your future.

185
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,312
Really?

186
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:17,836
You do?

187
00:09:17,836 --> 00:09:18,382
I do.

188
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:22,227
Ross, you're so great.

189
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,229
It's never gonna happen.

190
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,242
What?

191
00:09:42,242 --> 00:09:43,237
You and Rachel.

192
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,313
What--? Me and Ra--?

193
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,416
Why not?

194
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:56,894
You waited too long

195
00:09:56,894 --> 00:09:59,848
to make your move and now you're

197
00:09:59,848 --> 00:10:01,332
in the ''friend zone.''

198
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,448
I'm not in the zone.

199
00:10:04,448 --> 00:10:06,461
No, Ross. You're mayor of the zone.

200
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,841
Look, I'm taking my time, all right?

201
00:10:10,841 --> 00:10:13,241
I'm laying the groundwork.

202
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,813
Every day I get

203
00:10:14,813 --> 00:10:16,280
a little bit closer to--

204
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,373
Priesthood!

205
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,348
I'm telling you, she has

206
00:10:21,348 --> 00:10:23,344
no idea what you're thinking.

207
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,936
She just ran her fingers

208
00:10:24,936 --> 00:10:26,483
through my hair.

209
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,874
Were you missing that interaction?

210
00:10:28,874 --> 00:10:30,455
No, no, no.

211
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,514
This is running fingers

212
00:10:32,514 --> 00:10:34,465
through your hair, okay?

213
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:38,293
Now this is a tousle.

214
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,869
If you don't ask her out soon,

215
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:44,366
you'll be in the zone forever.

216
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,389
I will, I will.

217
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:48,368
I'm waiting for the right moment.

218
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,375
What?

219
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,348
What, now?

220
00:10:54,348 --> 00:10:55,411
Yeah.

221
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,274
What's messing you up?

222
00:10:59,274 --> 00:11:01,225
The wine? The moonlight?

223
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,327
You gotta go up to her and say,

224
00:11:03,327 --> 00:11:05,227
''Look, Rachel, I--''

225
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:07,863
What?

226
00:11:07,863 --> 00:11:10,918
We're shushing...because we're trying

228
00:11:10,918 --> 00:11:12,368
to hear something.

229
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:14,422
What? What?

230
00:11:14,422 --> 00:11:16,373
Don't you hear that?

231
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,536
See?

232
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,300
Would you like gum?

233
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,346
Is it sugarless?

234
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,371
Sorry, it's not.

235
00:11:34,371 --> 00:11:35,383
Then no, thanks.

236
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:36,450
What was that?

237
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,294
Mental note: If Jill Goodacre

238
00:11:41,294 --> 00:11:43,290
offers you gum, you take it.

239
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,450
If she offers you mangled

240
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:47,498
animal carcass, you take it!

241
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:53,274
New York City has no power

242
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,507
And the milk is getting sour

243
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,318
But to me it is not scary

244
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,446
Because I stay away from dairy

245
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:14,796
Here goes.

246
00:12:14,796 --> 00:12:15,359
You'll do it?

247
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,366
I'll do it.

248
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:17,264
Want help?

249
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,361
You come out, you're a dead man.

250
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:23,808
Good luck, man.

251
00:12:23,808 --> 00:12:25,275
Thanks.

252
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,327
Okay.

253
00:12:30,327 --> 00:12:31,373
Okay.

254
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,370
Where you going?

255
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,287
You can't go out there.

256
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,325
Why not?

257
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:42,293
Because of the reason.

258
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,379
That would be?

259
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:47,262
I can't tell you.

260
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,357
Joey, what's going on?

261
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,885
You gotta promise you'll

262
00:12:51,885 --> 00:12:54,302
never tell Ross that I told you.

263
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:55,840
What?

264
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,307
He's planning your birthday party.

265
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,808
Oh, my God! I love him!

266
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:02,338
You better act surprised.

267
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:03,813
About what?

268
00:13:03,813 --> 00:13:05,212
My surprise party.

269
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,285
What surprise party?

270
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:09,253
Oh, stop it. Joey already told me.

271
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,320
He didn't tell me.

272
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,522
Don't look at me. This is Ross' thing.

273
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,808
This is typical.

274
00:13:16,808 --> 00:13:18,355
I'm always the last to know.

275
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,421
You are not. We tell you stuff.

276
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,367
I was the last one to know when

277
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:26,268
Chandler got bit by the peacock.

278
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:28,786
I was the last to know

279
00:13:28,786 --> 00:13:30,333
you had a crush on Joey.

280
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,365
What?

281
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,245
Looks like I was second to last.

282
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,442
You had a crush on me?

283
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,905
All right. It wasn't a crush,

284
00:13:44,905 --> 00:13:47,356
it was a dent.

285
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,554
Big dent?

286
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,827
You were moving your furniture.

287
00:13:52,827 --> 00:13:55,358
I thought you had nice arms.

288
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,396
Nice arms, huh?

289
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,208
Hey, Mon, I'm moving the chair.

290
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,403
Do anything for you?

291
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,228
With all the lights out

292
00:14:11,228 --> 00:14:13,241
you can actually see the stars.

293
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,252
It's so nice.

294
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,358
I have a question.

295
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,779
Actually, it's not

296
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:26,229
so much a question.

297
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,395
It's more

298
00:14:27,395 --> 00:14:28,458
of a general wondering....

299
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,459
--ment.

300
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,449
Okay.

301
00:14:33,449 --> 00:14:35,428
Okay. Here it goes.

302
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,311
Well, for a while now,

303
00:14:40,311 --> 00:14:42,245
I've been wanting to....

304
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:45,397
Yes, that's right.

305
00:14:45,397 --> 00:14:47,445
Look at that little kitty!

306
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,378
What?

307
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,770
Top of the world

308
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,250
Looking down on creation

309
00:14:56,295 --> 00:15:00,288
And the only explanation I can find

310
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:05,199
Is the love that I found

311
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,197
Ever since you've been around

312
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,788
All right, this is just Bactine.

313
00:15:23,788 --> 00:15:25,255
It won't hurt.

314
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,806
Ow!

315
00:15:28,806 --> 00:15:30,353
Sorry, that was wax.

316
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,364
Poor little Tooty's scared.

317
00:15:34,364 --> 00:15:36,264
We should find his owner.

318
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,428
Why not put poor Tooty in the hall?

319
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:40,988
During a blackout?

320
00:15:40,988 --> 00:15:42,438
She'll get trampled.

321
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,271
Yeah?

322
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:49,447
Damage control. Get back to the gum.

323
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,477
Gum would be perfection.

324
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,278
Gum would be perfection?

325
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,446
Gum would be perfection.

326
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,822
Could've said,

327
00:16:00,822 --> 00:16:02,386
''Gum would be nice. '' But, no.

328
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:06,330
For me, gum is perfection.

329
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:10,292
I loathe myself!

330
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:13,917
Oh, no, they're nuns.

331
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:15,430
They hate all living things.

332
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:23,847
Hi. We just found this cat,

333
00:16:23,847 --> 00:16:26,247
and we're looking for the owner.

334
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,411
Yeah, it's mine.

335
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,354
He seems to hate you. Are you sure?

336
00:16:32,354 --> 00:16:34,453
It's my cat. Give me my cat.

337
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,378
Wait a minute. What's his name?

338
00:16:37,378 --> 00:16:39,329
Bob-- Buttons.

339
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:42,400
Bob Buttons?

340
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,334
Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.

341
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,431
You are a very bad man!

342
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,241
You owe me a cat.

343
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,441
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

344
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,381
Here, kitty, kitty.

345
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,478
Where did you go, little kitty?

346
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,340
Kitty, kitty, kitty.

347
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,257
Come here, kitty, kitty.

348
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,347
Hi.

349
00:17:14,347 --> 00:17:15,496
-Buona sera.

350
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,393
Wow!

351
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,738
Mon, wanna go for a ride

352
00:17:24,738 --> 00:17:26,234
in my racecar?

353
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,279
I'll bring my arms.

354
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,778
We can bring my wheelbarrow

355
00:17:30,778 --> 00:17:32,342
for your teeth!

356
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,255
Come on, lucky sixes!

357
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,418
Everybody, this is Paolo.

358
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,374
Paolo, I want you to meet my friends.

359
00:17:43,374 --> 00:17:45,422
This is Monica...

360
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:46,448
Hi.

361
00:17:46,448 --> 00:17:47,432
...and Joey...

362
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:48,950
Hi.

363
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,434
...and Ross.

364
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,294
Hi.

365
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,178
He doesn't speak much English.

366
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,215
Monopoly!

367
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,248
Look at that!

368
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,188
So, where did Paolo come from?

369
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,419
Italy, I think.

370
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,808
No, I mean tonight.

371
00:18:16,808 --> 00:18:18,389
Suddenly, into our lives.

372
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,782
That cat turned out to be Paolo's cat.

373
00:18:21,782 --> 00:18:24,233
Isn't that funny?

374
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,371
That is funny.

375
00:18:27,371 --> 00:18:29,305
And Rachel keeps touching him.

376
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,240
I looked all over and couldn't find

377
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,236
the kitty anywhere.

378
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,442
I found him. It was Paolo's cat.

379
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,901
Well, there you go.

380
00:18:40,901 --> 00:18:42,351
Last to know again.

381
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:47,222
And I'm guessing, this is Paolo?

382
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,361
Paolo, this is Phoebe.

383
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,425
You betcha!

384
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,297
All right. Okay. What next?

385
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:07,178
Blow a bubble. A bubble's good.

386
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:10,181
It's got a boyish charm. It's impish.

387
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,307
Here we go.

388
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,394
Nice going, imp!

389
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:30,299
It's okay. All I need to do is reach over and put it

391
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,398
back in my mouth.

392
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:36,274
Good save!

393
00:19:36,274 --> 00:19:41,335
We're back on track and I'm chewing someone else's gum.

395
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,365
This is not my gum!

396
00:19:44,365 --> 00:19:46,316
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

397
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:48,446
And now you're choking.

398
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,255
You all right?

399
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,317
My God! You're choking!

400
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,800
Better?

401
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,267
Yes.

402
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,234
Thank you. That was....

403
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:07,904
That was....

404
00:20:07,904 --> 00:20:09,337
Perfection?

405
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,295
That was no tousle.

406
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,767
What'd he say that was so funny?

407
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:43,264
I have absolutely no idea.

408
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,276
That's classic.

409
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:47,373
My God, you guys! What am I doing?

410
00:20:47,373 --> 00:20:49,369
This is so un-me!

411
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,473
If you want, I'll do it.

412
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:56,286
I just wanna bite his bottom lip.

413
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,381
But I won't.

414
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:04,240
The first time he smiled at me those seconds were more exciting

416
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,219
than weeks with Barry.

417
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,423
Did you rent mopeds?

418
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,902
Because I've heard--

419
00:21:11,902 --> 00:21:14,336
Oh, it's not about that right now.

420
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,407
I know it's superficial,

421
00:21:16,407 --> 00:21:20,456
and we have nothing in common and we don't even speak

423
00:21:20,456 --> 00:21:22,469
the same language, but, God!

424
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,902
Paolo, hi.

425
00:21:28,902 --> 00:21:30,352
Ross.

426
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,387
Listen....

427
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:38,454
Listen, something you should know.

428
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:42,296
Rachel and I are....

429
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,300
We're kind of a thing.

430
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,886
Thing?

431
00:21:46,886 --> 00:21:48,302
Thing. Yes, thing.

432
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,986
You have the sex?

433
00:21:49,986 --> 00:21:51,499
No.

434
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:55,008
No, technically the sex

435
00:21:55,008 --> 00:21:57,505
is not being had. But that's....

436
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,451
But that's not the point.

437
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,335
The point is that

438
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:05,417
Rachel and I should be....

439
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:07,754
Well, Rachel and I

440
00:22:07,754 --> 00:22:09,250
should be together.

441
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,319
And if you get in the--

442
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,380
In bed--

443
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,330
No.

444
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,461
No, not where I was going.

445
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,317
If you get in the way of us

446
00:22:19,317 --> 00:22:25,274
becoming a thing then I would be, well, very sad.

448
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,370
So, do you...?

449
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:36,300
So you do know a little English?

450
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,348
Little.

451
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,357
Do you know the word ''crap-weasel''?

452
00:22:40,357 --> 00:22:42,257
No.

453
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:44,376
That's funny.

454
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:45,491
You are a huge crap-weasel.

455
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:52,950
We've been doing this

456
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,497
for an hour. It's easy.

457
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,365
Ready?

458
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,412
Okay? Now try it.

459
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,316
You gotta whip it.

460
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:12,273
Look, look. The last candle's

461
00:23:12,273 --> 00:23:14,224
about to burn out.

462
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:20,898
Ten, nine, eight, seven minus 46, minus 47,

464
00:23:20,898 --> 00:23:23,366
minus 48....

465
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,264
Thank you.

466
00:23:25,264 --> 00:23:26,259
Thanks.

467
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:30,432
Kind of spooky without any lights.

468
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:40,383
Okay, guys, I have the definitive one.

469
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,261
This probably isn't the best time

470
00:23:55,261 --> 00:23:58,434
to bring it up but you have to throw

472
00:23:58,434 --> 00:23:59,566
a party for Monica.

473
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:08,810
This has been fun.

474
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:09,407
Yes.

475
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,331
Thanks for letting me

476
00:24:11,331 --> 00:24:15,413
use your phone...and for saving my life.

478
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:18,886
Well, goodbye, Chandler.

479
00:24:18,886 --> 00:24:20,450
I had a great blackout.

480
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,251
See you.

481
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:42,436
Hi, I'm account number 71 43457.

482
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:46,763
I don't know if you got that but I would really

484
00:24:46,763 --> 00:24:48,276
like a copy of the tape.
