1
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,438
Man, I sure miss Julie.

2
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:11,305
Spanish midgets.

3
00:00:11,348 --> 00:00:16,814
Spanish midgets wrestling Julie!

4
00:00:16,814 --> 00:00:18,310
Okay, I see how you got there.

5
00:00:24,227 --> 00:00:25,376
You ever figure out

6
00:00:25,376 --> 00:00:26,525
what that thing's for?

7
00:00:27,263 --> 00:00:28,525
I'm trying to screen.

8
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:31,244
If I answer the phone,

9
00:00:31,244 --> 00:00:33,223
people will think I have no life.

10
00:00:33,336 --> 00:00:34,331
My God!

11
00:00:34,331 --> 00:00:35,326
Rodrigo is never pinned!

12
00:00:35,438 --> 00:00:36,854
After the beep,

13
00:00:36,854 --> 00:00:38,270
you know what to do.

14
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:40,275
Hello. I'm looking for Bob.

15
00:00:40,377 --> 00:00:41,861
It's Jade.

16
00:00:41,861 --> 00:00:43,345
If this is still your number....

17
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,877
I was thinking about how great it was.

18
00:00:45,877 --> 00:00:50,464
I know it's been three years but I was hoping

19
00:00:50,464 --> 00:00:52,477
we could hook up again.

20
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:54,284
I barely had the nerve

21
00:00:54,284 --> 00:00:55,279
to call...

22
00:00:55,392 --> 00:00:56,421
-...so you know what I did?.

23
00:00:56,421 --> 00:00:57,450
What?

24
00:00:57,494 --> 00:01:01,197
I got a little drunk and naked.

25
00:01:01,297 --> 00:01:03,231
Bob here!

26
00:01:52,382 --> 00:01:55,374
So, what have you been up to?

27
00:01:55,452 --> 00:01:57,386
Oh, you know, the usual.

28
00:01:57,454 --> 00:02:02,286
Teaching aerobics partying way too much.

29
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:06,324
And in case you wondered those are my legs on

30
00:02:06,324 --> 00:02:08,354
the new James Bond poster.

31
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:12,347
Can you hold on?

32
00:02:12,347 --> 00:02:13,393
I have another call.

33
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:14,784
I love her!

34
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:15,364
I know.

35
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:18,322
I'm back.

36
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:19,437
-So are we gonna get together?

37
00:02:20,243 --> 00:02:21,790
Absolutely.

38
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,337
How about tomorrow afternoon?

39
00:02:23,446 --> 00:02:24,879
Do you know Central Perk?

40
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,312
5-ish?

41
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:28,783
-Great. I'll see you then.

42
00:02:28,783 --> 00:02:31,217
Okay.

43
00:02:31,254 --> 00:02:32,448
Okay.

44
00:02:33,256 --> 00:02:36,419
Having a phone has finally paid off.

45
00:02:37,427 --> 00:02:43,795
You do a good Bob impression but when she sees you she may realize that,

46
00:02:43,795 --> 00:02:45,325
hey, you're not Bob.

47
00:02:45,435 --> 00:02:48,268
You see Tattoo....

48
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:50,422
Jade's fantasy is to rekindle

49
00:02:50,422 --> 00:02:52,373
the love she had with Bob.

50
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:54,471
My fantasy is that you

51
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:56,467
talk like a normal person.

52
00:02:57,247 --> 00:02:57,861
I hope when

53
00:02:57,861 --> 00:03:01,729
he doesn't show she'll seek comfort in the open arms

54
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:04,209
of the wry stranger at the next table.

55
00:03:04,287 --> 00:03:05,834
Oh, my God.

56
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:07,381
You are pure evil.

57
00:03:08,324 --> 00:03:13,185
Okay, pure evil horny and alone.

58
00:03:15,331 --> 00:03:17,322
I've done this.

59
00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:26,207
Yeah, everybody's here.

60
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:28,402
Say hi to Julie in New Mexico!

61
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:29,433
Hi, Julie!

62
00:03:30,246 --> 00:03:33,306
Hi, Julie. So what.

63
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:36,885
While Ross is on the phone everybody owes me

64
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:38,352
62 bucks for his birthday.

65
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:40,434
Is there any chance that

66
00:03:40,434 --> 00:03:47,253
you're rounding up from...you know, from like 20?

67
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,926
We got the gift,

68
00:03:48,926 --> 00:03:50,422
the concert and the cake.

69
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:53,264
Do we need a cake?

70
00:03:54,337 --> 00:03:57,272
I know it's a little steep.

71
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:01,267
But it's Ross.

72
00:04:02,212 --> 00:04:02,706
It's Ross.

73
00:04:02,706 --> 00:04:03,200
Right.

74
00:04:03,313 --> 00:04:03,842
I know.

75
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:04,371
All right.

76
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,448
I'll see you guys later.

77
00:04:06,448 --> 00:04:08,416
I gotta go do a thing.

78
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:11,319
Okay, I'll call you later.

79
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:12,905
You're not going through with this,

80
00:04:12,905 --> 00:04:14,389
are you?

81
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:17,421
You know, I think I might just.

82
00:04:19,429 --> 00:04:21,380
So, what are you guys

83
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,331
doing for dinner tonight?

84
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:25,384
Well, I gotta start

85
00:04:25,384 --> 00:04:27,335
saving up for Ross' birthday.

86
00:04:27,403 --> 00:04:28,899
I guess I'll stay home

87
00:04:28,899 --> 00:04:30,395
and eat dust bunnies.

88
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:33,300
You believe how much this costs?

89
00:04:33,343 --> 00:04:34,890
Do you guys ever

90
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:39,312
get the feeling that Chandler and those guys don't get

91
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,411
that we don't make that much money?

92
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:42,730
Yes.

93
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,242
Really?

94
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,786
They say,

95
00:04:44,786 --> 00:04:46,253
let's go here, let's go there.

96
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:47,835
Like we can afford to go

97
00:04:47,835 --> 00:04:49,348
here and there.

98
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:52,360
Yes, and we always have to go

99
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,261
someplace nice, you know? God.

100
00:04:55,365 --> 00:04:57,833
And we can't say anything about it,

101
00:04:57,833 --> 00:05:00,301
because this is a birthday for Ross.

102
00:05:00,403 --> 00:05:01,335
For Ross.

103
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:02,267
For Ross.

104
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:06,237
Oh, my God!

105
00:05:06,237 --> 00:05:07,300
Hi.

106
00:05:07,377 --> 00:05:11,347
Okay, I'm at work just an ordinary day,

107
00:05:11,347 --> 00:05:13,315
chop, chop, sauté, sauté.

108
00:05:14,183 --> 00:05:16,413
The manager calls me into his office.

109
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:18,682
They fired the lunch chef.

110
00:05:18,682 --> 00:05:20,178
Guess who got it?

111
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,786
If it's not you,

112
00:05:21,786 --> 00:05:23,282
this is a horrible story.

113
00:05:24,394 --> 00:05:26,328
Fortunately, it is me.

114
00:05:26,396 --> 00:05:29,229
And they made me head of purchasing!

115
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:31,199
That's so cool!

116
00:05:31,234 --> 00:05:32,764
Anyway, I think we

117
00:05:32,764 --> 00:05:34,294
should go out and celebrate.

118
00:05:34,404 --> 00:05:37,202
You know, someplace nice.

119
00:05:42,312 --> 00:05:43,438
Someplace nice.

120
00:05:44,247 --> 00:05:45,731
How much you think

121
00:05:45,731 --> 00:05:47,215
I can get for my kidney?

122
00:05:53,256 --> 00:05:54,353
You can't do this.

123
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,450
Come on.

124
00:05:56,225 --> 00:05:57,772
I can't get a girl like her with

125
00:05:57,772 --> 00:05:59,319
conventional methods.

126
00:05:59,362 --> 00:06:00,812
It doesn't matter.

127
00:06:00,812 --> 00:06:02,262
She wanted to call Bob.

128
00:06:02,365 --> 00:06:03,832
Bob could be

129
00:06:03,832 --> 00:06:05,299
who she was meant to be with.

130
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:06,881
You may be destroying

131
00:06:06,881 --> 00:06:08,394
a chance for happiness.

132
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:11,265
We don't know Bob.

133
00:06:11,374 --> 00:06:13,342
Okay, we know me. We like me.

134
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:15,310
Please let me be happy.

135
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,230
Go over there

136
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,181
and tell that woman the truth.

137
00:06:20,316 --> 00:06:22,307
All right.

138
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:24,379
Go.

139
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:32,857
Hi.

140
00:06:32,857 --> 00:06:34,387
Hi.

141
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:36,391
Listen, I have to....

142
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,327
I have to confess something.

143
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:41,300
Yes?

144
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:46,299
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.

145
00:06:47,243 --> 00:06:48,238
How did you--?

146
00:06:48,238 --> 00:06:49,233
I don't know.

147
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:53,365
I just had this weird sense. But

148
00:06:53,365 --> 00:06:56,317
that's me, I'm weird and sensitive.

149
00:06:58,254 --> 00:06:59,346
Tissue?

150
00:07:00,256 --> 00:07:01,382
Thanks.

151
00:07:02,392 --> 00:07:05,259
No, you keep the pack.

152
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:08,195
I'm all cried out today.

153
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:23,289
Here is to my sister,

154
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:26,269
the newly appointed head lunch chef.

155
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:28,306
Also in charge of purchasing.

156
00:07:28,384 --> 00:07:29,851
Head lunch chef,

157
00:07:29,851 --> 00:07:31,318
in charge of purchasing--

158
00:07:31,421 --> 00:07:33,355
Who has her own little desk

159
00:07:33,355 --> 00:07:35,289
when Roland's not there.

160
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:37,387
Lunch chef, purchasing, own desk

161
00:07:37,387 --> 00:07:41,312
when Roland's not there here's to my--

162
00:07:41,312 --> 00:07:43,195
Wait! And I got a beeper!

163
00:07:43,232 --> 00:07:44,329
Cool.

164
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:45,426
Let's see.

165
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:48,326
That's fine, I'll just wait.

166
00:07:48,404 --> 00:07:51,339
Sorry.

167
00:07:51,407 --> 00:07:53,307
Monica!

168
00:07:55,411 --> 00:07:56,924
Are we ready to order?

169
00:07:56,924 --> 00:07:58,437
We haven't even looked.

170
00:07:59,215 --> 00:08:00,375
When you do, let me know.

171
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,646
I'll be over there

172
00:08:02,646 --> 00:08:04,142
on the edge of my seat.

173
00:08:09,192 --> 00:08:10,352
Look at these prices!

174
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,288
Yeah, these are pretty cha-ching.

175
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:16,263
I know. What are these,

176
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:18,163
famous chickens?

177
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:20,265
Sorry I'm late. Congratulations.

178
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:21,362
Thanks.

179
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:23,439
I'm not sorry. How incredible

180
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,407
was my afternoon with Jade?

181
00:08:26,175 --> 00:08:28,171
Pretty incredible, according to

182
00:08:28,171 --> 00:08:30,167
the message on my machine.

183
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,292
Why is this woman leaving a message

184
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:34,305
for you on my machine?

185
00:08:34,383 --> 00:08:36,379
I told her my number was yours.

186
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:40,735
I couldn't say it was mine because she thinks

187
00:08:40,735 --> 00:08:42,282
my number is Bob's number.

188
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:44,839
Tell me again.

189
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:46,386
What do I do when Mr. Roper calls?

190
00:08:48,331 --> 00:08:49,320
Do I dare ask?

191
00:08:49,432 --> 00:08:51,332
I'll start with carpaccio,

192
00:08:51,332 --> 00:08:53,232
then the grilled prawns.

193
00:08:53,336 --> 00:08:55,236
Sounds great, same for me.

194
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:56,868
And for the gentleman?

195
00:08:56,868 --> 00:08:58,398
I'll have the Thai pizza.

196
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,290
But if I get it without the nuts

197
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,372
and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?

198
00:09:04,247 --> 00:09:06,374
You'd think, wouldn't you?

199
00:09:07,183 --> 00:09:09,663
Miss.

200
00:09:09,663 --> 00:09:12,143
Okay, I will have the side salad.

201
00:09:12,388 --> 00:09:13,872
And what would that

202
00:09:13,872 --> 00:09:15,356
be on the side of?

203
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,926
I don't know. Why don't you just put

204
00:09:17,926 --> 00:09:20,394
it right here next to my water.

205
00:09:22,398 --> 00:09:24,366
And for you?

206
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:27,436
I'm gonna have a cup

207
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:30,405
of the cucumber soup and....

208
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:34,266
Take care.

209
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:37,875
I will have the Cajun catfish.

210
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:39,371
Anything else?

211
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:41,746
Yes, how about a verse of

212
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:43,310
''Killing Me Softly''?

213
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,916
You're gonna sneeze

214
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,412
in my fish, aren't you?

215
00:09:52,228 --> 00:09:54,310
Does anybody else feel like

216
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,392
they just gave birth to an alien?

217
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,392
No!

218
00:09:58,434 --> 00:10:02,302
Plus tip, divided by six....

219
00:10:02,338 --> 00:10:06,206
And everyone owes 28 bucks.

220
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:07,435
Everyone?

221
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:10,404
You're right, I'm sorry.

222
00:10:11,213 --> 00:10:12,202
Thank you.

223
00:10:12,248 --> 00:10:14,244
Monica's night. She shouldn't pay.

224
00:10:14,244 --> 00:10:16,240
Thank you.

225
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:20,415
So five of us is $33.50 apiece.

226
00:10:21,223 --> 00:10:22,269
No. No way.

227
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:23,315
Sorry, not gonna happen.

228
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:26,428
Prom night flashback.

229
00:10:28,431 --> 00:10:34,332
Sorry, I'm happy you got promoted but cold cucumber mush

230
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:37,330
for 30-something bucks? No!

231
00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:40,809
Rachel just had that little salad and

232
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:44,245
Joey with a teeny pizza! It's just....

233
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,248
Okay, Pheebs.

234
00:10:46,349 --> 00:10:48,345
How about we'll each pay for

235
00:10:48,345 --> 00:10:50,341
what we had? It's no big deal.

236
00:10:50,453 --> 00:10:52,478
Not for you.

237
00:10:56,258 --> 00:10:58,385
All right, what's going on?

238
00:10:58,461 --> 00:11:01,379
I don't wanna get into this right now.

239
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:04,297
It'll make everybody uncomfortable.

240
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:06,390
You can tell us.

241
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:09,403
Yeah, hello? It's us. We'll be fine.

242
00:11:10,206 --> 00:11:11,298
Yeah.

243
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:21,831
Okay, we three feel like that sometimes

244
00:11:21,831 --> 00:11:25,215
you guys don't get that....

245
00:11:32,228 --> 00:11:33,343
We don't have

246
00:11:33,343 --> 00:11:34,458
as much money as you.

247
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,396
Okay.

248
00:11:39,396 --> 00:11:40,425
I hear you.

249
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,429
We can talk about that.

250
00:11:44,373 --> 00:11:48,456
Well, then...let's.

251
00:11:48,456 --> 00:11:49,536
Fine.

252
00:11:50,346 --> 00:11:52,894
I guess I just never think

253
00:11:52,894 --> 00:11:55,442
of money as an issue.

254
00:11:55,551 --> 00:11:56,916
Because you have it.

255
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,281
Good point.

256
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:02,257
So how come you guys

257
00:12:02,257 --> 00:12:04,225
haven't talked about this before?

258
00:12:04,293 --> 00:12:05,840
It's always something.

259
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:11,423
Like Monica's new job or the whole Ross' birthday hoopla.

260
00:12:12,234 --> 00:12:14,867
I don't want my birthday to be

261
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,500
the source of any kind of negative....

262
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,333
There's gonna be a hoopla?

263
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:24,328
Basically there's the thing,

264
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:27,246
and then the stuff after the thing--

265
00:12:27,349 --> 00:12:29,846
If you feel better, we'll forget

266
00:12:29,846 --> 00:12:32,343
the thing and we'll just do the gift.

267
00:12:32,455 --> 00:12:35,453
Gift? The thing's not the gift?

268
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:38,451
We would see Hootie and the Blowfish.

269
00:12:39,261 --> 00:12:40,228
Hootie and the--

270
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:44,231
I can catch them on the radio.

271
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,846
No. Now I feel bad.

272
00:12:45,846 --> 00:12:47,359
You wanna go to the concert.

273
00:12:47,436 --> 00:12:51,852
No, look. It's my birthday and the important thing

274
00:12:51,852 --> 00:12:53,365
is that we're together.

275
00:12:53,476 --> 00:12:55,455
All of us.

276
00:12:55,455 --> 00:12:57,434
Not at the concert.

277
00:12:58,447 --> 00:12:59,362
Okay.

278
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,277
Thank you.

279
00:13:00,382 --> 00:13:01,377
Thanks.

280
00:13:01,377 --> 00:13:02,372
Yeah.

281
00:13:08,224 --> 00:13:10,220
So the Ebola virus.

282
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,216
That's gotta suck, huh?

283
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:19,298
Monica, what's in the bag?

284
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,397
I don't know. Let's take a look.

285
00:13:21,437 --> 00:13:24,304
It's like a skit.

286
00:13:25,307 --> 00:13:28,305
Why, it's dinner for six. Five steaks

287
00:13:28,305 --> 00:13:31,303
and an eggplant for Phoebe.

288
00:13:32,314 --> 00:13:34,362
We switched meat suppliers.

289
00:13:34,362 --> 00:13:36,410
They gave me steaks as a thank-you.

290
00:13:36,452 --> 00:13:38,903
But wait, there's more.

291
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:41,354
Chandler, what is in that envelope?

292
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:45,255
By the way, this didn't

293
00:13:45,255 --> 00:13:47,251
seem so dorky out in the hall.

294
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:49,297
Why, it's six tickets to

295
00:13:49,297 --> 00:13:51,265
Hootie and the Blowfish!

296
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:55,428
The Blowfish!

297
00:13:56,472 --> 00:13:58,423
It's on us. So don't worry.

298
00:13:58,423 --> 00:14:00,374
This is our treat.

299
00:14:01,277 --> 00:14:04,212
So, thank you.

300
00:14:06,282 --> 00:14:08,216
Could you be less enthused?

301
00:14:08,284 --> 00:14:10,349
Look, it's a nice gesture. It is.

302
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,414
But it just feels like....

303
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:14,381
Like?

304
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,241
Charity.

305
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:17,191
Charity?

306
00:14:17,293 --> 00:14:19,420
We're just trying to do a nice thing.

307
00:14:20,196 --> 00:14:22,244
You have to understand, your

308
00:14:22,244 --> 00:14:24,292
nice thing makes us feel this big.

309
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,234
Actually, it makes us feel that big.

310
00:14:30,306 --> 00:14:31,802
I don't understand.

311
00:14:31,802 --> 00:14:33,298
We can't win.

312
00:14:33,342 --> 00:14:36,374
If you all feel this big, maybe that's

313
00:14:36,374 --> 00:14:39,406
not our fault, it's just how you feel.

314
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:44,215
Now you're telling us how we feel.

315
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,311
We shouldn't talk about this.

316
00:14:46,355 --> 00:14:48,903
I'm gonna pass on the concert.

317
00:14:48,903 --> 00:14:51,451
Just not in a Hootie place right now.

318
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,447
Me neither!

319
00:14:55,447 --> 00:14:56,431
Me too!

320
00:14:56,532 --> 00:14:59,262
Guys, we bought the tickets.

321
00:14:59,335 --> 00:15:01,752
Then you'll have extra seats

322
00:15:01,752 --> 00:15:04,169
for all your tiaras and stuff.

323
00:15:04,273 --> 00:15:05,740
Why did you look at me

324
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,207
when you said that?

325
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:12,380
So I guess now we can't go.

326
00:15:12,481 --> 00:15:15,331
Do what you want. Do we always

327
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,181
have to do everything together?

328
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,211
You know what? You're right.

329
00:15:20,322 --> 00:15:22,290
Fine!

330
00:15:25,294 --> 00:15:27,194
All right.

331
00:15:27,296 --> 00:15:29,389
We're gonna go.

332
00:15:34,336 --> 00:15:36,366
It's not for another six hours.

333
00:15:36,366 --> 00:15:38,396
We're gonna go then.

334
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:46,345
Chandler.

335
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,243
Yeah.

336
00:15:47,316 --> 00:15:48,863
Jesus! Are you ready?

337
00:15:48,863 --> 00:15:50,410
Yes.

338
00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:52,431
Just let me grab my jacket

339
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:54,410
and tell you I had sex today.

340
00:15:56,325 --> 00:15:58,316
What? You had sex today?

341
00:15:59,228 --> 00:16:00,741
It sounds even cooler

342
00:16:00,741 --> 00:16:02,254
when somebody else says it.

343
00:16:03,265 --> 00:16:05,313
I was awesome. She was biting her lip

344
00:16:05,313 --> 00:16:07,361
to stop from screaming.

345
00:16:07,469 --> 00:16:08,401
Wow.

346
00:16:09,204 --> 00:16:11,183
I know it's been a while,

347
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:13,162
but I took that as a good sign.

348
00:16:17,413 --> 00:16:19,796
Still doing the screening?

349
00:16:19,796 --> 00:16:22,179
I had sex today.

350
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:23,802
I never have to

351
00:16:23,802 --> 00:16:25,286
answer that phone again.

352
00:16:25,387 --> 00:16:26,803
After the beep,

353
00:16:26,803 --> 00:16:28,219
you know what to do.

354
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:29,416
Bob, it's Jade.

355
00:16:30,192 --> 00:16:31,841
I wanted to tell you I was hurt

356
00:16:31,841 --> 00:16:33,490
when you didn't show up.

357
00:16:34,229 --> 00:16:36,277
And just so you know,

358
00:16:36,277 --> 00:16:38,325
I ended up meeting a guy.

359
00:16:39,301 --> 00:16:40,797
Bob here.

360
00:16:40,797 --> 00:16:42,293
Oh, hi.

361
00:16:42,404 --> 00:16:44,395
So you met someone, huh?

362
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,305
Yes, I did.

363
00:16:46,408 --> 00:16:48,404
In fact, I had sex

364
00:16:48,404 --> 00:16:50,400
with him two hours ago.

365
00:16:52,448 --> 00:16:55,417
So how was he?

366
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:57,314
Eh.

367
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:05,385
Eh?

368
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:09,392
Bob, he was nothing compared to you.

369
00:17:12,301 --> 00:17:13,848
I bit my lip to keep from

370
00:17:13,848 --> 00:17:15,395
screaming your name.

371
00:17:18,207 --> 00:17:21,199
Well, that makes me feel so good.

372
00:17:21,377 --> 00:17:25,313
It was just so awkward and bumpy.

373
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:28,678
Maybe he had some kind of new,

374
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:31,175
cool style you're not familiar with.

375
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,380
Maybe get used to it.

376
00:17:33,188 --> 00:17:35,236
There wasn't much time to get

377
00:17:35,236 --> 00:17:37,284
used to it, if you know what I mean.

378
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:50,305
I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.

379
00:17:50,406 --> 00:17:52,374
Yeah, I know. It's my birthday.

380
00:17:52,374 --> 00:17:54,342
We all should be here.

381
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,344
So let's go.

382
00:18:02,351 --> 00:18:05,149
Maybe we should stay for one song.

383
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,687
It would be rude to them

384
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:08,154
for us to leave.

385
00:18:08,223 --> 00:18:09,736
The guys are probably

386
00:18:09,736 --> 00:18:11,249
having a great time.

387
00:18:14,363 --> 00:18:16,331
Come on, you guys. One more time.

388
00:18:16,331 --> 00:18:18,299
Okay.

389
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:19,863
One.

390
00:18:19,863 --> 00:18:21,359
No.

391
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:31,246
That was amazing!

392
00:18:31,246 --> 00:18:32,213
Excellent!

393
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:33,879
I can't believe the guys missed it!

394
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,477
What guys? Yeah.

395
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:38,903
Excuse me.

396
00:18:38,903 --> 00:18:40,387
Aren't you Monica Geller?

397
00:18:40,422 --> 00:18:41,804
Do I know you?

398
00:18:41,804 --> 00:18:43,186
You babysat me!

399
00:18:44,193 --> 00:18:46,189
Oh, my God! Little Stevie Fisher?

400
00:18:46,189 --> 00:18:48,185
How have you been?

401
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,424
Good. I'm a lawyer now.

402
00:18:50,332 --> 00:18:51,378
You can't be a lawyer.

403
00:18:51,378 --> 00:18:52,424
You're 8.

404
00:18:53,202 --> 00:18:54,299
Nice to see you.

405
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,396
I gotta run backstage.

406
00:18:55,504 --> 00:18:56,971
Backstage?

407
00:18:56,971 --> 00:18:58,438
My firm represents the band.

408
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:00,236
Ross.

409
00:19:00,236 --> 00:19:01,231
Chandler.

410
00:19:02,377 --> 00:19:03,759
You wanna meet the group?

411
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:05,141
Yeah!

412
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:06,236
Come on.

413
00:19:06,281 --> 00:19:08,232
Are you one of the ones

414
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:10,183
that fooled around with my dad?

415
00:19:15,257 --> 00:19:16,246
Hey, you guys!

416
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,321
Happy birthday!

417
00:19:18,321 --> 00:19:20,351
Thank you.

418
00:19:22,264 --> 00:19:24,255
How was your night last night?

419
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:26,266
It pretty much sucked.

420
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:28,166
How was yours?

421
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,318
Ours sucked too. But I ran into

422
00:19:30,318 --> 00:19:32,366
Stevie Fisher. Remember him?

423
00:19:33,175 --> 00:19:35,291
Oh, yeah! I used to babysit him.

424
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,407
How's his dad?

425
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:40,273
Good.

426
00:19:40,382 --> 00:19:41,895
Aside from that,

427
00:19:41,895 --> 00:19:43,408
the evening was a bust.

428
00:19:44,219 --> 00:19:46,380
Yeah, we really missed you guys.

429
00:19:47,189 --> 00:19:49,185
Yeah, we were just saying,

430
00:19:49,185 --> 00:19:51,181
this whole thing is so stupid.

431
00:19:51,226 --> 00:19:53,808
We just have to really not let stuff

432
00:19:53,808 --> 00:19:56,390
like this about money, get like--

433
00:19:56,431 --> 00:19:59,229
Is that a hickey?

434
00:20:00,202 --> 00:20:01,499
No, I just....

435
00:20:02,237 --> 00:20:04,296
I fell down.

436
00:20:05,507 --> 00:20:08,305
On someone's lips?

437
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:10,758
Where'd you get the hickey?

438
00:20:10,758 --> 00:20:12,305
You know, a party or--

439
00:20:12,347 --> 00:20:14,281
What party?

440
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:19,219
It wasn't a party so much as a gathering of people.

441
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:24,358
With food and music and the band.

442
00:20:24,426 --> 00:20:25,893
You partied with

443
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:27,360
Hootie and the Blowfish?

444
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:29,397
Yes. Apparently,

445
00:20:29,397 --> 00:20:31,365
Stevie and Hootie are like this:

446
00:20:31,466 --> 00:20:34,230
Who gave you that hickey?

447
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:37,238
That would be the work of a Blowfish.

448
00:20:39,441 --> 00:20:40,937
I can't believe it!

449
00:20:40,937 --> 00:20:42,433
I can't believe this!

450
00:20:42,544 --> 00:20:45,496
We're just sitting at home,

451
00:20:45,496 --> 00:20:50,434
trying to guess Joey's fingers and you guys are out like partying

452
00:20:50,434 --> 00:20:52,385
and having fun and all:

453
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:55,479
''Hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck!''

454
00:20:58,293 --> 00:20:59,743
Don't blame us.

455
00:20:59,743 --> 00:21:01,193
You could've been there.

456
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,278
What? As part of your

457
00:21:03,278 --> 00:21:05,326
poor friends outreach program?

458
00:21:06,201 --> 00:21:07,293
Great, it's work.

459
00:21:07,336 --> 00:21:09,287
I don't know what to say.

460
00:21:09,287 --> 00:21:11,238
Sorry we make more than you.

461
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,836
We're not gonna feel guilty.

462
00:21:12,836 --> 00:21:14,332
We work hard.

463
00:21:14,443 --> 00:21:16,308
And we don't work hard?

464
00:21:16,411 --> 00:21:18,311
It's Monica. You paged?

465
00:21:18,347 --> 00:21:20,377
It's just that we like doing stuff

466
00:21:20,377 --> 00:21:22,407
that costs a little more.

467
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:23,935
And you feel like we hold you back.

468
00:21:23,935 --> 00:21:25,419
Yes!

469
00:21:26,221 --> 00:21:27,313
No!

470
00:21:30,325 --> 00:21:33,317
Leon, wait. Guys!

471
00:21:33,428 --> 00:21:35,828
I don't understand. The steaks were

472
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:38,228
a gift from the meat vendor.

473
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:39,814
That was not a kickback.

474
00:21:39,814 --> 00:21:44,337
I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing.

475
00:21:46,275 --> 00:21:48,368
What corporate policy?

476
00:21:49,278 --> 00:21:50,336
No--

477
00:21:53,348 --> 00:21:54,372
Yeah.

478
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,342
Okay.

479
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,415
I just got fired.

480
00:22:09,231 --> 00:22:11,279
Here's your check. That'll be $4.1 2.

481
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:13,327
Let me get that.

482
00:22:16,505 --> 00:22:19,303
You got 5 bucks?

483
00:22:27,516 --> 00:22:29,364
Here comes the beep.

484
00:22:29,364 --> 00:22:31,212
You know what to do.

485
00:22:31,253 --> 00:22:33,414
Hi, it's me.

486
00:22:36,325 --> 00:22:37,838
Listen, Bob.

487
00:22:37,838 --> 00:22:39,351
I'm probably way out of line here.

488
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:41,440
It's been three years,

489
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,483
and you're probably seeing someone but if we could have one night,

490
00:22:45,483 --> 00:22:47,434
for old times' sake....

491
00:22:47,469 --> 00:22:52,429
One hot, steamy, wild night....
