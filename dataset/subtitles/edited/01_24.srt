1
00:00:04,553 --> 00:00:09,252
Oh, here's little Ben falling asleep.

2
00:00:09,358 --> 00:00:13,556
A little bit later. Is he gonna sleep?

3
00:00:14,296 --> 00:00:19,256
Is he gonna sleep? Is he gonna?

4
00:00:19,368 --> 00:00:22,269
Yep, out like a light!

5
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:23,935
This sure trumps

6
00:00:23,935 --> 00:00:25,499
the ''Has he pooped?'' series.

7
00:00:26,275 --> 00:00:27,503
Ross, we love him, okay?

8
00:00:28,277 --> 00:00:29,790
But right now he's just

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,303
a little fat guy.

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,506
How excited can we get?

11
00:00:35,384 --> 00:00:36,880
What you got?

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,376
400 pictures of Ben on a rug.

13
00:00:38,487 --> 00:00:39,983
Oh, my God!

14
00:00:39,983 --> 00:00:41,479
Let me see!

15
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:30,363
Here's little Ben nodding off.

16
00:01:30,473 --> 00:01:33,374
Look at Aunt Monica's little boy!

17
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:35,427
Look, he's got Ross' haircut.

18
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:37,378
Let me see.

19
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,976
Oh, God!

20
00:01:38,976 --> 00:01:40,472
Is he just the sweetest thing?

21
00:01:41,283 --> 00:01:44,377
You must just wanna kiss him all over.

22
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,383
That would be nice.

23
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:53,923
Pardon?

24
00:01:53,923 --> 00:01:54,417
Nothing.

25
00:01:54,497 --> 00:01:57,398
Just a little extra air in my mouth.

26
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:03,902
Chan, can you help me out?

27
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:05,466
I'll pay you back.

28
00:02:06,275 --> 00:02:08,323
Right. Including the waffles

29
00:02:08,323 --> 00:02:13,272
last week, you now owe me 1 7 jillion dollars.

30
00:02:13,482 --> 00:02:15,916
Really, I'll pay you back this time.

31
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:18,350
Where's this money coming from?

32
00:02:18,454 --> 00:02:20,354
I'm helping out at the NYU

33
00:02:20,354 --> 00:02:22,254
Med School with research.

34
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:23,484
What kind of research?

35
00:02:25,494 --> 00:02:27,553
Just, you know, science.

36
00:02:28,464 --> 00:02:30,364
Science.

37
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:34,462
Yeah, I think I've heard of that.

38
00:02:36,472 --> 00:02:39,407
It's a fertility study.

39
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:42,425
Joey, please tell me you're only

40
00:02:42,425 --> 00:02:45,275
donating your time.

41
00:02:46,382 --> 00:02:49,374
Actually, a little more than that.

42
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:52,451
Thank you, God.

43
00:02:52,451 --> 00:02:54,516
This will bring us so much joy.

44
00:02:55,391 --> 00:02:58,292
Come on, it's not that big a deal.

45
00:02:58,327 --> 00:02:59,373
I just go down there

46
00:02:59,373 --> 00:03:02,726
every other day and make my contribution

47
00:03:02,726 --> 00:03:04,222
to the project.

48
00:03:04,333 --> 00:03:05,783
But at the end of two weeks,

49
00:03:05,783 --> 00:03:07,233
I get $ 700!

50
00:03:08,337 --> 00:03:09,850
You're gonna be making money

51
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,363
hand over fist.

52
00:03:13,442 --> 00:03:15,433
That's funny. Very funny.

53
00:03:16,278 --> 00:03:18,826
This is great. I actually know

54
00:03:18,826 --> 00:03:21,374
somebody who loves what they do.

55
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:25,384
But what do you do to unwind

56
00:03:25,384 --> 00:03:27,483
after a tough day at work?

57
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:33,257
Okay, we got the coleslaw and buns.

58
00:03:33,362 --> 00:03:35,410
The ground-up flesh

59
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,458
of formerly cute cows and turkeys.

60
00:03:39,268 --> 00:03:41,498
I just love barbecuing with you.

61
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:44,462
Men are here!

62
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:51,376
We make fire.

63
00:03:53,415 --> 00:03:54,575
Cook meat.

64
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:56,813
Put out fire by peeing,

65
00:03:56,813 --> 00:03:58,309
no get invited back.

66
00:03:58,387 --> 00:03:59,479
Cute.

67
00:04:00,256 --> 00:04:01,353
Melanie called. She'll be late.

68
00:04:01,353 --> 00:04:02,450
Okay.

69
00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:05,756
How are things going? Is she

70
00:04:05,756 --> 00:04:08,253
becoming your ''special someone''?

71
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:12,366
I don't know. She's pretty great.

72
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:14,385
What does she think of

73
00:04:14,385 --> 00:04:16,336
your little science project?

74
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,352
You think I'd tell a girl I like

75
00:04:19,352 --> 00:04:21,365
that I'm also seeing a cup?

76
00:04:24,446 --> 00:04:26,277
Man's got a point.

77
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:28,299
The tough thing is,

78
00:04:28,299 --> 00:04:30,250
she really wants to have sex.

79
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:32,286
Crazy bitch.

80
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:38,923
I got a week left to go.

81
00:04:38,923 --> 00:04:43,862
According to the rules I can't conduct personal

82
00:04:43,862 --> 00:04:46,461
experiments, if you know what I mean.

83
00:04:46,502 --> 00:04:50,404
Joey, we always know what you mean.

84
00:04:57,513 --> 00:04:59,413
How long did you think

85
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:01,313
this barbecue would last?

86
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,784
I'm going to China.

87
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:06,218
Jeez, you say one thing, and....

88
00:05:06,455 --> 00:05:08,434
China?

89
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:10,413
For the museum. Someone found a bone.

90
00:05:11,226 --> 00:05:13,251
They don't want us to have it.

91
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:15,894
I'm going to try to persuade them.

92
00:05:15,894 --> 00:05:18,459
It's a whole big bone thing.

93
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:21,361
Anyway, I'll be gone for a week.

94
00:05:21,437 --> 00:05:23,985
If you want to reach me, you can't.

95
00:05:23,985 --> 00:05:26,533
So here's my itinerary.

96
00:05:28,243 --> 00:05:29,358
Here's a picture of me.

97
00:05:29,358 --> 00:05:30,473
Oh, let me see.

98
00:05:31,347 --> 00:05:33,844
Could you show it to Ben every now

99
00:05:33,844 --> 00:05:36,341
and then so he doesn't forget me?

100
00:05:36,485 --> 00:05:40,251
''Hi, Ben. I'm your father.''

101
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:44,349
''I am The Head!''

102
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:52,490
This barbecue's gonna be very fun.

103
00:05:53,268 --> 00:05:54,866
I wanted to wish Rachel

104
00:05:54,866 --> 00:05:56,464
a happy birthday before I left.

105
00:05:57,272 --> 00:05:59,354
She's out having drinks with Carl.

106
00:05:59,354 --> 00:06:01,436
Hey, who's Carl?

107
00:06:04,346 --> 00:06:07,213
That guy she met at the coffeehouse.

108
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:09,331
There's this guy she met at--

109
00:06:09,331 --> 00:06:11,413
The coffeehouse? Right.

110
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:14,212
So you do know who he is.

111
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:20,326
I'll go say goodbye to the guys.

112
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:21,909
Hey, you know what?

113
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:23,456
Tell them that bone story.

114
00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:32,372
I have to go to China.

115
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:34,272
The country?

116
00:06:35,344 --> 00:06:37,392
No, this big pile of dishes

117
00:06:37,392 --> 00:06:39,440
in my mom's breakfront.

118
00:06:40,382 --> 00:06:42,282
Do you know who Carl is?

119
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:44,416
Let's see. Alvin, Simon, Theodore....

120
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,481
No.

121
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:49,807
Rachel's having

122
00:06:49,807 --> 00:06:51,257
drinks with him tonight.

123
00:06:51,293 --> 00:06:52,891
How can she, when she's never

124
00:06:52,891 --> 00:06:54,489
shown interest in you?

125
00:06:55,397 --> 00:06:56,830
Forget about her.

126
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,263
He's right.

127
00:06:58,367 --> 00:06:59,834
Please move on. Go to China.

128
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:01,301
Eat Chinese food.

129
00:07:01,437 --> 00:07:02,933
Of course, there

130
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:04,429
they just call it ''food.''

131
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,403
Yeah, I guess. I don't know.

132
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:10,775
All right, just give her this

133
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:12,339
for me, okay?

134
00:07:12,448 --> 00:07:14,382
We're looking out for you.

135
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:16,316
We want you to be happy.

136
00:07:16,418 --> 00:07:18,818
I may only have a couple beers

137
00:07:18,818 --> 00:07:21,218
in me, but I love you.

138
00:07:23,225 --> 00:07:24,453
I'm still on my first.

139
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:30,227
I just think you're nice.

140
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:38,451
That's when we started

141
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:40,430
this fruit basket business.

142
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:42,910
We call ourselves

143
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,344
''The Three Basketeers.''

144
00:07:45,447 --> 00:07:47,347
Like ''The Three Musketeers,''

145
00:07:47,347 --> 00:07:49,247
only with fruit.

146
00:07:55,357 --> 00:07:56,853
How do you want your burgers?

147
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:58,349
Presents first!

148
00:07:58,393 --> 00:08:01,294
We're doing presents first.

149
00:08:02,498 --> 00:08:04,847
Hey, hold on there, tiger.

150
00:08:04,847 --> 00:08:07,196
How are you holding up?

151
00:08:07,302 --> 00:08:09,253
Well, not so good.

152
00:08:09,253 --> 00:08:13,319
She thinks tonight we're gonna complete the transaction,

153
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,332
if you know what-- And you do.

154
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:17,378
Have you ever thought about

155
00:08:17,378 --> 00:08:19,312
being there for her?

156
00:08:19,448 --> 00:08:21,416
What do you mean?

157
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:28,451
You know, just be there for her.

158
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:32,418
Not following you.

159
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:37,455
Think about it.

160
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:47,504
Okay. I'm guessing this is from....

161
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:52,313
Thank you, Melanie.

162
00:08:52,313 --> 00:08:54,247
This one right here is from me.

163
00:08:54,349 --> 00:08:59,286
Okay. It's light. It rattles.

164
00:08:59,354 --> 00:09:04,283
It's...Travel Scrabble!

165
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:09,296
Thank you.

166
00:09:12,434 --> 00:09:14,334
This one's from Joey.

167
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:16,871
It feels like a book, I think it's

168
00:09:16,871 --> 00:09:19,339
a book. And it's a book!

169
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:21,399
It's Dr. Seuss!

170
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:24,362
That book got me through

171
00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:26,313
some tough times.

172
00:09:26,448 --> 00:09:27,898
There's a little child

173
00:09:27,898 --> 00:09:29,348
inside this man.

174
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:31,369
The doctors say if they remove it,

175
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:33,320
he'll die.

176
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:36,419
Who's this from?

177
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:37,414
From Ross.

178
00:09:43,465 --> 00:09:47,526
Oh, my God! He remembered!

179
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,787
Remembered what?

180
00:09:49,787 --> 00:09:51,237
It was months ago.

181
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,904
We walked by this antique store.

182
00:09:52,904 --> 00:09:54,468
I saw this pin.

183
00:09:55,243 --> 00:09:57,342
I told him it was like one

184
00:09:57,342 --> 00:09:59,441
my grandma had when I was little.

185
00:10:00,248 --> 00:10:02,375
I can't believe he remembered!

186
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:04,402
Well, sure, but can you

187
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:06,353
play it on a plane?

188
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,328
It's so pretty!

189
00:10:13,328 --> 00:10:15,296
This must've cost him a fortune.

190
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,388
I can't believe it.

191
00:10:16,465 --> 00:10:17,961
Remember when he

192
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:21,815
fell in love with Carol and bought her that

193
00:10:21,815 --> 00:10:23,362
expensive crystal duck?

194
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:26,303
What did you just say?

195
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:39,477
Crystal duck.

196
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:48,591
No, no, no. The ''love'' part?

197
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:58,322
Oh, my God!

198
00:10:58,322 --> 00:11:01,240
Oh, no, no, no.

199
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,741
That's good. Just keep rubbing

200
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:07,238
your head. That'll turn back time.

201
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:14,902
This is unbelievable.

202
00:11:14,902 --> 00:11:16,449
I mean, this is unbelievable!

203
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,356
I know.

204
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:19,453
This is really, really huge.

205
00:11:19,494 --> 00:11:21,928
No, it's not. It's small.

206
00:11:21,928 --> 00:11:24,362
It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.

207
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,896
I don't think any of our lives

208
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:29,393
will ever be the same ever again.

209
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:33,373
Is there a mute button on this woman?

210
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:35,426
I think this is so great.

211
00:11:35,426 --> 00:11:37,377
I mean, you and Ross!

212
00:11:37,412 --> 00:11:38,896
Did you have any idea?

213
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:40,380
No, none!

214
00:11:40,482 --> 00:11:42,450
My first night in the city,

215
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:46,477
he mentioned asking me out but nothing ever happened.

216
00:11:46,588 --> 00:11:48,436
What else did he say?

217
00:11:48,436 --> 00:11:50,284
Does he wanna go out?

218
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:54,494
Given that he's in love with you he wouldn't mind getting

219
00:11:54,494 --> 00:11:56,394
a cup of coffee.

220
00:11:56,498 --> 00:11:58,966
Ross? All this time?

221
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:01,434
I've gotta talk to him.

222
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:03,003
He's in China!

223
00:12:03,003 --> 00:12:04,470
The country.

224
00:12:08,276 --> 00:12:09,368
Is his flight gone?

225
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:12,470
Yes! He's watching a woman do this:

226
00:12:13,248 --> 00:12:14,237
He's gone!

227
00:12:14,282 --> 00:12:15,379
His flight doesn't leave

228
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:16,476
for 45 minutes.

229
00:12:17,285 --> 00:12:19,264
What about time difference?

230
00:12:19,264 --> 00:12:21,243
From here to the airport?

231
00:12:22,357 --> 00:12:23,403
You'll never make it!

232
00:12:23,403 --> 00:12:24,449
I've gotta try.

233
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,251
What'll you say to him?

234
00:12:27,295 --> 00:12:28,392
I don't know.

235
00:12:28,392 --> 00:12:29,489
Then you shouldn't go.

236
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:31,863
Right. If you're gonna

237
00:12:31,863 --> 00:12:33,461
break his heart, that can wait.

238
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:36,260
But if it's good, tell him now.

239
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:38,822
Maybe I'll know when I see him.

240
00:12:38,822 --> 00:12:41,273
All right, does this help?

241
00:12:47,282 --> 00:12:49,830
No. Look, all I know is, I cannot

242
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:52,378
wait a week. This is just too big.

243
00:12:52,487 --> 00:12:54,483
I've just gotta talk to him.

244
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,479
Okay, I'll see you later.

245
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,442
Rachel, I love you!

246
00:12:58,442 --> 00:13:00,359
Deal with me first!

247
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:14,230
All right.

248
00:13:19,347 --> 00:13:21,298
Ross! Excuse me, pardon me.

249
00:13:21,298 --> 00:13:23,249
Your boarding pass?

250
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:25,285
I need to talk to my friend.

251
00:13:25,353 --> 00:13:27,349
Sorry, you're not allowed here

252
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,345
without a pass.

253
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,921
He's right there,

254
00:13:30,921 --> 00:13:32,451
in the blue jacket! Can I--?

255
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:34,489
I'm sorry. Federal regulations!

256
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:37,276
Then could you please

257
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:39,255
just give him a message for me?

258
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:41,363
This is very important.

259
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,359
All right. What's the message?

260
00:13:44,372 --> 00:13:46,306
I don't know.

261
00:13:48,276 --> 00:13:50,392
Excuse me, sir! Excuse me, sir?

262
00:13:50,392 --> 00:13:52,508
I have a message for you.

263
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:55,329
Rachel loved the present.

264
00:13:55,329 --> 00:13:57,377
She'll see you when you get back.

265
00:13:57,485 --> 00:13:59,316
What?

266
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:01,785
Toby, I don't know

267
00:14:01,785 --> 00:14:03,315
what she's talking about.

268
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,473
There's no Rachel.

269
00:14:05,473 --> 00:14:07,521
Don't give me that deep freeze.

270
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:21,272
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!

271
00:14:21,376 --> 00:14:23,310
I think I blacked out there

272
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,244
for a minute.

273
00:14:26,248 --> 00:14:28,239
It was nothing.

274
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,346
Well, now we gotta

275
00:14:30,346 --> 00:14:32,342
find something fun for you.

276
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:37,287
You know what?

277
00:14:39,294 --> 00:14:40,892
Forget about me.

278
00:14:40,892 --> 00:14:42,490
Let's give you another turn.

279
00:14:45,367 --> 00:14:47,335
Me, again?

280
00:14:47,335 --> 00:14:49,303
Sure. Why not?

281
00:14:51,506 --> 00:14:54,504
Boy, somebody's gonna get

282
00:14:54,504 --> 00:14:57,502
a big fruit basket tomorrow!

283
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,930
I gotta tell you, you are nothing like

284
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,444
I thought you'd be.

285
00:15:07,222 --> 00:15:08,314
How do you mean?

286
00:15:08,423 --> 00:15:10,823
I had you pegged as a guy

287
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:13,223
who's always, ''Me, me, me!''

288
00:15:13,328 --> 00:15:16,354
But you, you're a giver.

289
00:15:17,532 --> 00:15:18,982
You're the most generous man

290
00:15:18,982 --> 00:15:20,432
I ever met.

291
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:23,534
I mean, you're practically a woman.

292
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:33,362
You're just saying that.

293
00:15:33,362 --> 00:15:35,245
No.

294
00:15:36,484 --> 00:15:38,349
A woman!

295
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:50,410
So?

296
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,456
I missed him.

297
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:52,932
I'm so sorry.

298
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:54,365
That's too bad.

299
00:15:54,402 --> 00:15:56,302
Yeah, right.

300
00:15:56,504 --> 00:15:58,495
No, I feel bad for her. I do.

301
00:15:59,307 --> 00:16:00,854
I can think of somebody

302
00:16:00,854 --> 00:16:02,401
other than myself.

303
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:04,435
All right, I'm going to bed.

304
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:07,895
Happy birthday. Hang in there.

305
00:16:07,895 --> 00:16:09,442
Thanks.

306
00:16:10,452 --> 00:16:11,441
Yes!

307
00:16:14,322 --> 00:16:15,346
Pizza coupons.

308
00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:22,358
Okay. You guys want help

309
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:24,354
cleaning up this mess?

310
00:16:24,432 --> 00:16:26,332
That'd be great.

311
00:16:29,437 --> 00:16:30,950
So, Rach, you wanna save

312
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,463
this wrapping paper?

313
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:35,357
Are you gonna go for it with Ross

314
00:16:35,357 --> 00:16:37,473
or should I throw it out?

315
00:16:40,448 --> 00:16:44,441
I don't know. I don't know.

316
00:16:44,486 --> 00:16:45,919
Thought about it

317
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,869
all the way there and I thought about it all the way

318
00:16:49,869 --> 00:16:52,349
back. You know, it's Ross!

319
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,258
You know what I mean? It's Ross.

320
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:56,313
Sure!

321
00:16:56,313 --> 00:16:57,263
Sure.

322
00:16:57,298 --> 00:16:59,795
I don't know. This is just

323
00:16:59,795 --> 00:17:05,200
my initial gut feeling but I'm thinking

324
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,196
it'd be really great.

325
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:08,840
Oh, my God, me too!

326
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,438
We'd be like friends-in-law!

327
00:17:12,213 --> 00:17:13,726
The best part is you already

328
00:17:13,726 --> 00:17:15,239
know all about him.

329
00:17:15,316 --> 00:17:17,341
You start on the 1 5th date.

330
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:19,352
But it would be like

331
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:21,252
starting on the 1 5th date.

332
00:17:22,223 --> 00:17:24,214
Another good point.

333
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:26,289
I mean, on the 1 5th date,

334
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:29,943
you're already in a very ''relationship-y'' place.

335
00:17:29,943 --> 00:17:31,456
You're committed.

336
00:17:35,336 --> 00:17:37,429
What happens if it doesn't work out?

337
00:17:38,239 --> 00:17:39,354
Why isn't it working out?

338
00:17:39,354 --> 00:17:40,469
Sometimes it doesn't.

339
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:42,874
Is he not cute enough?

340
00:17:42,874 --> 00:17:44,472
Does he not make enough money?

341
00:17:45,246 --> 00:17:46,742
No, I'm just--

342
00:17:46,742 --> 00:17:48,238
Maybe there's someone else.

343
00:17:48,283 --> 00:17:50,382
Is there someone else?

344
00:17:50,382 --> 00:17:52,481
No, there is no one else.

345
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:55,449
Then why are you dumping my brother?

346
00:18:06,334 --> 00:18:09,201
Hey, big-- Spender!

347
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:13,401
She's still asleep.

348
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:16,274
So how'd it go?

349
00:18:16,274 --> 00:18:18,339
You know how you think you're great?

350
00:18:18,413 --> 00:18:20,409
The fact you'd even ask

351
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:22,405
shows how little you know me.

352
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:25,334
Last night I couldn't do the thing

353
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:27,450
that usually makes me great.

354
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,316
So I had to do all this other stuff.

355
00:18:30,425 --> 00:18:33,326
And the response I got! Man, oh, man!

356
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:36,420
It was like a ticker-tape parade!

357
00:18:37,465 --> 00:18:39,945
I know. My room's very, very close

358
00:18:39,945 --> 00:18:42,425
to the parade route.

359
00:18:47,275 --> 00:18:48,856
It was amazing, and not just for her.

360
00:18:48,856 --> 00:18:50,437
For me too!

361
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:52,759
It's like, all of a sudden

362
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:55,816
I'm blind but all my other senses

363
00:18:55,816 --> 00:18:57,283
are heightened.

364
00:18:57,385 --> 00:18:58,835
It's like I was able

365
00:18:58,835 --> 00:19:02,322
to appreciate it on another level.

366
00:19:05,226 --> 00:19:07,706
I didn't know you had another level.

367
00:19:07,706 --> 00:19:10,186
I know. Neither did I!

368
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:15,202
Is something going on with O.J.?

369
00:19:25,346 --> 00:19:28,213
Hey, great skirt. Birthday present?

370
00:19:28,249 --> 00:19:28,778
From who?

371
00:19:28,778 --> 00:19:29,307
You.

372
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,251
I exchanged the blouse you got me.

373
00:19:33,354 --> 00:19:35,219
Well, it's the thought.

374
00:19:35,523 --> 00:19:37,923
Doesn't Ross' flight get in

375
00:19:37,923 --> 00:19:40,323
in a couple hours? At gate 27B?

376
00:19:41,462 --> 00:19:43,862
Yeah. Monica, you know, I've been

377
00:19:43,862 --> 00:19:46,262
thinking about it.

378
00:19:46,334 --> 00:19:47,881
I've decided this Ross thing

379
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:49,428
is not a good idea.

380
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,459
Why?

381
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:52,837
I feel like I wouldn't

382
00:19:52,837 --> 00:19:54,435
just be going out with him.

383
00:19:54,475 --> 00:19:56,454
I'd be going out with all of you.

384
00:19:56,454 --> 00:19:58,433
There'd be pressure--

385
00:19:58,546 --> 00:20:00,446
No pressure, no pressure!

386
00:20:02,383 --> 00:20:03,867
Nothing has happened,

387
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:05,351
and you're already so--

388
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:07,365
I'm not ''so.'' Okay, I was a teensy

389
00:20:07,365 --> 00:20:12,483
bit weird at first but I'll be good. I promise.

390
00:20:17,498 --> 00:20:18,931
Who is it?

391
00:20:18,931 --> 00:20:20,364
-It's me, Carl.

392
00:20:20,468 --> 00:20:21,918
Come on up.

393
00:20:21,918 --> 00:20:23,368
Behind my brother's back?

394
00:20:25,373 --> 00:20:27,870
Is the kind of crazy thing

395
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,367
you won't be hearing from me.

396
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,937
Seven hundred bucks!

397
00:20:43,937 --> 00:20:45,484
All right, you did it!

398
00:20:45,526 --> 00:20:48,290
Do we have any fruit?

399
00:20:50,398 --> 00:20:52,389
Man, hell of a two weeks.

400
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,967
You know what?

401
00:20:53,967 --> 00:20:55,434
I feel I learned something.

402
00:20:55,503 --> 00:20:56,953
You'll stick with this

403
00:20:56,953 --> 00:20:58,403
''all for her'' thing?

404
00:20:58,439 --> 00:21:00,270
What are you, crazy?

405
00:21:00,441 --> 00:21:02,938
When a blind man gets his sight back,

406
00:21:02,938 --> 00:21:05,435
does he walk around like this?

407
00:21:10,385 --> 00:21:12,319
If I see one more picture

408
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,420
of Ed Begley Jr in that stupid electric car,

409
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,485
I'm gonna shoot myself!

410
00:21:20,261 --> 00:21:21,876
I'm not against

411
00:21:21,876 --> 00:21:25,459
environmental issues, per se it's just that guy!

412
00:21:26,301 --> 00:21:28,280
I can't believe you'd rather

413
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,259
go out with him than me.

414
00:21:30,471 --> 00:21:31,938
Excuse me, I'm trying

415
00:21:31,938 --> 00:21:33,405
to have a date here.

416
00:21:34,275 --> 00:21:37,267
Fine. Just stop thinking about me.

417
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,505
Can't do it, can you?

418
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:44,576
I'm thinking about you. So what?

419
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,850
I don't get it.

420
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,380
What do you see in this guy?

421
00:21:49,424 --> 00:21:52,291
Happens to be a very nice guy.

422
00:21:52,327 --> 00:21:53,857
I mean, come on, buddy!

423
00:21:53,857 --> 00:21:55,387
Get a real car!

424
00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:02,233
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.

425
00:22:02,437 --> 00:22:04,337
Ross, it's too hard.

426
00:22:04,372 --> 00:22:06,823
Why, because it'll get weird

427
00:22:06,823 --> 00:22:09,274
for everyone else? This is about us.

428
00:22:09,377 --> 00:22:10,924
I've been in love with you

429
00:22:10,924 --> 00:22:12,471
since the ninth grade.

430
00:22:13,281 --> 00:22:15,380
You're like my best friend.

431
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,479
If we broke up, and I lost you--

432
00:22:18,252 --> 00:22:19,480
What makes you think that?

433
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:22,318
Have you been involved

434
00:22:22,318 --> 00:22:24,348
where you haven't broken up?

435
00:22:26,394 --> 00:22:27,361
No.

436
00:22:28,363 --> 00:22:32,265
But it only has to happen once.

437
00:22:32,367 --> 00:22:34,818
You and I both know we are perfect

438
00:22:34,818 --> 00:22:37,269
for each other. Right?

439
00:22:37,372 --> 00:22:39,420
So the only question is:

440
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,468
Are you attracted to me?

441
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,478
I don't know.

442
00:22:46,381 --> 00:22:47,848
I mean, I've never looked at you

443
00:22:47,848 --> 00:22:49,315
that way before.

444
00:22:50,284 --> 00:22:51,410
Well, start looking.

445
00:23:02,363 --> 00:23:03,358
Wow.

446
00:23:03,358 --> 00:23:04,353
Exactly!

447
00:23:04,432 --> 00:23:08,748
And I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead

448
00:23:08,748 --> 00:23:10,261
in traffic!

449
00:23:12,373 --> 00:23:15,240
Right! You're right.

450
00:23:16,244 --> 00:23:17,233
You know what?

451
00:23:17,278 --> 00:23:18,825
I'm supposed to pick up

452
00:23:18,825 --> 00:23:20,372
a friend at the airport.

453
00:23:20,448 --> 00:23:22,439
I am so sorry!

454
00:23:23,251 --> 00:23:24,764
If you wanna finish your drinks,

455
00:23:24,764 --> 00:23:26,277
please do.

456
00:23:26,387 --> 00:23:27,934
I'm sorry, I gotta go. I'm sorry.

457
00:23:27,934 --> 00:23:29,481
But....

458
00:23:35,363 --> 00:23:36,830
Where are you going?

459
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:38,297
To get Ross.

460
00:23:38,366 --> 00:23:39,412
My God, this is so exciting!

461
00:23:39,412 --> 00:23:40,458
I know.

462
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:43,317
If you want the rest of my date,

463
00:23:43,317 --> 00:23:45,365
I'm not gonna finish it.

464
00:23:45,473 --> 00:23:48,391
Rachel, he's not a sandwich.

465
00:23:48,391 --> 00:23:51,309
No, he's a banker with opera tickets.

466
00:23:52,413 --> 00:23:54,381
Hello!

467
00:23:57,585 --> 00:23:58,535
Where you going?

468
00:23:58,535 --> 00:23:59,485
Airport.

469
00:24:00,254 --> 00:24:01,784
You can't tell him.

470
00:24:01,784 --> 00:24:03,314
There's so much I haven't done.

471
00:24:03,357 --> 00:24:04,853
I haven't watched Baywatch

472
00:24:04,853 --> 00:24:06,349
with Yasmine Bleeth!

473
00:24:08,262 --> 00:24:10,241
Chandler, relax. This is a good

474
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:12,220
going to the airport.

475
00:24:12,433 --> 00:24:14,384
Oh, well then fly, good woman,

476
00:24:14,384 --> 00:24:16,335
fly like the wind.

477
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,854
I'm flying!

478
00:24:17,854 --> 00:24:19,338
Tell him I'm the one who blew it!

479
00:24:20,541 --> 00:24:22,992
Yes, another successful case

480
00:24:22,992 --> 00:24:25,443
for the love doctor.

481
00:24:34,255 --> 00:24:35,802
Excuse me! Pardon me.

482
00:24:35,802 --> 00:24:37,349
Excuse me. Sorry.

483
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:39,772
Toby, for God's sake,

484
00:24:39,772 --> 00:24:41,285
will you let it go?

485
00:24:41,395 --> 00:24:42,555
There's no Rachel!

486
00:24:47,568 --> 00:24:50,503
Hey! I got that.

487
00:24:51,372 --> 00:24:52,384
Thanks, sweetie.

488
00:24:52,384 --> 00:24:53,396
No problem.

489
00:24:59,413 --> 00:25:00,829
I can't wait for you

490
00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:02,245
to meet my friends.

491
00:25:02,316 --> 00:25:05,217
You don't think they'll judge me?

492
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:06,769
No, they will. I just....

493
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:08,219
Can't wait!

494
00:25:08,322 --> 00:25:10,415
Come on, they're gonna love you.
