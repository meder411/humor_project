1
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:04,328
Let it go. It's not a big deal.

2
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:06,905
Not a big deal? It's amazing. You

3
00:00:06,905 --> 00:00:09,373
reach in, there's one maneuver and bam!

4
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,535
A bra. Right out the sleeve.

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,813
As far as I know, guys don't do

6
00:00:14,813 --> 00:00:17,281
anything that comes close. Right?

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,342
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.

8
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:23,286
We can? Okay, I'm trying that.

9
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,288
Know what blows my mind?

10
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:27,923
Women can see breasts

11
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:29,453
anytime they want.

12
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:32,880
You look down,

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,262
and there they are.

14
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,834
How you get any work done

15
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:37,301
is beyond me.

16
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,935
I don't get how guys can do

17
00:00:39,935 --> 00:00:44,368
so many mean things and not even care.

18
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:51,846
Multiple orgasms!

19
00:00:51,846 --> 00:00:53,376
There you go.

20
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,274
Saturday night. The big night!

21
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,287
Date night!

22
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:52,266
Saturday night. Saturday night!

23
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,442
No plans, huh?

24
00:01:54,442 --> 00:01:55,471
Not a one!

25
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,474
Not even breaking up with Janice?

26
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:02,248
Right, right. Shut up.

27
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:04,740
Chandler, nobody likes

28
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,224
breaking up with someone.

29
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,294
Except for Kevin Millmore,

30
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,262
may he rot in hell.

31
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,314
You just gotta do it.

32
00:02:12,314 --> 00:02:14,265
I know. But it's just so hard.

33
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:15,830
You're sitting there with her.

34
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,326
She has no idea.

35
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,803
You finally get up

36
00:02:18,803 --> 00:02:20,236
the courage to do it.

37
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,405
There's that awkward moment

38
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:24,470
when you've handed her the note.

39
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,897
You try to run out of the restaurant

40
00:02:28,897 --> 00:02:31,348
before she's finished the note.

41
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,464
Why do you have to break up with her?

42
00:02:34,464 --> 00:02:37,444
Be a man. Just stop calling.

43
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,283
If you want, I'll do it with you.

44
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,328
She'd feel like

45
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,262
we're ganging up on her.

46
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:46,395
You dump Janice,

47
00:02:46,395 --> 00:02:47,492
I'll dump Tony.

48
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,383
You're breaking up with Tony?

49
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:52,465
He's sweet, but it's not fun anymore.

50
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,905
I don't know if it's me or

51
00:02:54,905 --> 00:02:57,305
his hunger strike, I don't know.

52
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,243
Do you want anything else?

53
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,361
You had a nutty, chocolate-y,

54
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:04,409
kind of cake-y, pie thing that--

55
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,221
Nothing. I'm fine.

56
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,449
What's wrong? Why so scrunchie?

57
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,238
My father wants to give me

58
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:17,217
a Mercedes convertible.

59
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,356
That guy, he burns me up.

60
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,946
Yeah, it's a Mercedes

61
00:03:21,946 --> 00:03:23,459
if I move back home.

62
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,754
It was horrible!

63
00:03:25,754 --> 00:03:27,238
He called me ''young lady.''

64
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,807
I hate when my father

65
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:30,274
calls me that.

66
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,359
Did he say

67
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:34,242
''You're not up to this'' again?

68
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,814
I got the extended version

69
00:03:35,814 --> 00:03:40,444
with choruses of ''You'll Never Make it on Your Own.''

70
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,483
Hi, Joey.

71
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,352
Oh, my God! Angela!

72
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,924
Wow! Being dumped

73
00:03:49,924 --> 00:03:51,454
by you agrees with her.

74
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,032
Are you gonna go over there?

75
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:56,500
No. Yeah. No.

76
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,883
Okay, but not yet.

77
00:03:58,883 --> 00:04:00,396
I don't wanna seem too eager.

78
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:07,859
One Mississippi, two Mississippi three Mississippi.

79
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:09,406
That seems pretty cool.

80
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,834
Hey, Angela.

81
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:15,250
Joey.

82
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,413
You look good.

83
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,305
That's because I'm wearing a dress

84
00:04:19,305 --> 00:04:21,353
that accents my boobs.

85
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,231
You don't say.

86
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,920
So, Rachel, what are you

87
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,370
doing tonight?

88
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,452
Big glamour night.

89
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:37,465
Me and Monica at Launderama.

90
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,362
You wanna hear a freakish coincidence?

91
00:04:41,362 --> 00:04:44,280
Guess who's doing laundry there too?

92
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,479
Who?

93
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:46,474
Me!

94
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,244
Was that not clear?

95
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:53,450
Why don't...?

96
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,376
Why don't I just

97
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:57,259
join you both there?

98
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,793
Don't you have a laundry room

99
00:04:58,793 --> 00:05:00,289
in your building?

100
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,292
Yes.

101
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,303
I do have a laundry room

102
00:05:05,303 --> 00:05:07,203
in my building.

103
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,433
But there's a rat problem.

104
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,858
Apparently, they're attracted

105
00:05:12,858 --> 00:05:14,405
to dryer sheets.

106
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,927
They're going in fine,

107
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,407
but they're coming out all fluffy.

108
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,788
Anyway, 7-ish?

109
00:05:23,788 --> 00:05:25,221
Sure.

110
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,394
Forget it. I'm with Bob now.

111
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:32,527
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?

112
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,365
Bob is great. He's smart,

113
00:05:35,365 --> 00:05:37,464
sophisticated, and he has a real job.

114
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,903
You go on three auditions a month

115
00:05:39,903 --> 00:05:41,535
and you're an actor. Bob--

116
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:45,335
Come on! We were great together.

117
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:47,858
And not just at the fun stuff,

118
00:05:47,858 --> 00:05:50,338
but, like, talking too.

119
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,401
Sorry, Joey. You said,

120
00:05:55,401 --> 00:05:57,449
''Let's be friends.'' So guess what?

121
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,241
What?

122
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:00,225
We're just friends.

123
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,190
Fine. Fine.

124
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,246
Why don't the four of us have

125
00:06:04,246 --> 00:06:06,197
dinner tonight? As friends.

126
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,391
What ''four of us''?

127
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:09,816
You and Bob,

128
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:14,238
and me and my girlfriend...Monica.

129
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,790
I'm telling you,

130
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,240
this guy's perfect for you.

131
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,322
Forget it! Not after your cousin

132
00:06:19,322 --> 00:06:21,301
who could belch the alphabet.

133
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:23,880
Come on, this guy's great.

134
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,866
His name's Bob. He's Angela's brother. He's smart,

135
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:31,422
he's sophisticated and he has a real job.

136
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,520
I go on three auditions a month

137
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,516
and say I'm an actor, but he's--

138
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:36,842
God help us.

139
00:06:36,842 --> 00:06:37,422
What?

140
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:38,913
Ugly Naked Guy

141
00:06:38,913 --> 00:06:40,363
is laying kitchen tile.

142
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,431
Look, I'm asking a favor here.

143
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,923
If I do this for her brother,

144
00:06:48,923 --> 00:06:51,374
maybe Angela will come back to me.

145
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,991
What's going on?

146
00:06:52,991 --> 00:06:54,538
You go out with tons of girls.

147
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:58,273
I know, but Angela's different.

148
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,932
She's like one of a kind,

149
00:07:00,932 --> 00:07:03,480
like a snowflake or....

150
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,291
Something else like a snowflake?

151
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,191
Yeah, yeah.

152
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,394
Look, I made a huge mistake.

153
00:07:11,394 --> 00:07:13,493
I never should've broke up with her.

154
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,292
Will you help me? Please?

155
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,273
Hold on a sec.

156
00:07:26,273 --> 00:07:28,303
You need to not touch any of those.

157
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,341
Okay, bye.

158
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,285
Monica's not coming.

159
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:35,253
It's just gonna be me and Rachel.

160
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:38,752
Hold on, camper.

161
00:07:38,752 --> 00:07:40,248
You've thought this through?

162
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,293
It's laundry.

163
00:07:42,293 --> 00:07:44,227
The thinking-through is minimal.

164
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,459
Just you and Rachel?

165
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:46,454
Just you two?

166
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,847
This is a date.

167
00:07:48,847 --> 00:07:50,428
You're going on a date.

168
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,851
Uh-uh.

169
00:07:53,851 --> 00:07:56,365
Uh-huh.

170
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,711
I haven't done that in a while.

171
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:02,179
Is it a date if she doesn't know?

172
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,732
Yes, absolutely.

173
00:08:04,732 --> 00:08:07,183
Saturday night, all rules apply.

174
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:09,254
What are you saying? I should

175
00:08:09,254 --> 00:08:11,222
shave again? Pick up some wine?

176
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,241
Well, you may wanna rethink

177
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:15,192
the dirty underwear.

178
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,294
It's the first time she'll see

179
00:08:18,294 --> 00:08:20,393
your underwear. You want it dirty?

180
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,328
No.

181
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,297
And the fabric softener?

182
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,404
Okay, now what is wrong

183
00:08:31,404 --> 00:08:33,400
with my Snuggles?

184
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:35,777
What? It says I'm a sensitive,

185
00:08:35,777 --> 00:08:37,341
warm kind of guy.

186
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,442
You know, like a little fuzzy bear.

187
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,885
I'll pick something else up.

188
00:08:43,885 --> 00:08:45,415
There you go.

189
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,417
Thank you.

190
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,346
What does Bob look like?

191
00:08:52,346 --> 00:08:54,229
Is he tall, short?

192
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,424
Yep.

193
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:58,399
Which?

194
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,462
Which what?

195
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,821
You've never met Bob, have you?

196
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:04,368
No, but--

197
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:06,826
For all we know, he's horribly--

198
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:09,209
Hey, Joey!

199
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,295
Horribly attractive.

200
00:09:11,295 --> 00:09:13,308
I'll be shutting up now.

201
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,188
Where are they? Where are they?

202
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,891
This is nice. We never

203
00:09:21,891 --> 00:09:23,489
do anything, just the two of us.

204
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,312
Great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent

205
00:09:26,312 --> 00:09:28,394
a car, run over some puppies.

206
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:31,301
I don't wanna do that.

207
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,921
Here we go.

208
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:35,337
Have a good breakup.

209
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,261
Hey, Janice.

210
00:09:39,261 --> 00:09:41,212
My God, I am so glad you called me.

211
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:45,240
I had the most supremely awful day.

212
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,216
That's not good.

213
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,850
Can I get an espresso

214
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,346
and a latte over here?

215
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,437
We got the proofs from the shoot

216
00:09:53,437 --> 00:09:55,450
with the vegetables. They sucked.

217
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:57,741
I blew off the afternoon.

218
00:09:57,741 --> 00:09:59,254
I went shopping.

219
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,267
And I got you....

220
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,337
I'm looking. I'm looking.

221
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,371
I'm looking.

222
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,339
I got you--

223
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:10,237
What?

224
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,941
What?

225
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:13,539
What did you get me there?

226
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:19,274
I got you these.

227
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,343
Bullwinkle socks.

228
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:22,820
That's sweet.

229
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,253
I knew you had Rockys.

230
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,872
You can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle

231
00:10:26,872 --> 00:10:29,454
or Rocky and Rocky, or you can mix.

232
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,929
Moose and squirrel.

233
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:34,363
Whatever you want.

234
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,886
I'm gonna get another espresso.

235
00:10:39,886 --> 00:10:42,269
More latte?

236
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,570
No, I'm still working on mine.

237
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,850
That's it?

238
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,283
Yeah, it was really hard.

239
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,871
Yeah, the hug looked pretty brutal.

240
00:10:56,871 --> 00:10:59,322
You weren't there.

241
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,778
Sorry.

242
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:05,228
How are things going?

243
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,794
Going? Things are not going.

244
00:11:06,794 --> 00:11:08,324
She got me socks.

245
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,948
These go with your Rockys. She really

246
00:11:10,948 --> 00:11:13,462
cares about you-- I'm sorry.

247
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,477
Coming through. Move. Move!

248
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,924
Excuse me! I was kind of

249
00:11:35,924 --> 00:11:37,488
using that machine.

250
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,357
Yeah, well, now you're kind of not.

251
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,934
But I saved it.

252
00:11:42,934 --> 00:11:44,401
I put my basket on top.

253
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:45,936
I'm sorry.

254
00:11:45,936 --> 00:11:47,369
Is that your basket?

255
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:49,488
It's pretty.

256
00:11:49,488 --> 00:11:51,570
Unfortunately, I don't see suds!

257
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,268
What?

258
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:58,374
No suds, no save, okay?

259
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,412
What's going on?

260
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,472
Nothing. This horrible woman

261
00:12:04,472 --> 00:12:06,423
just took my machine.

262
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,318
Was your basket on top?

263
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:09,439
Yeah, but there were no suds.

264
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:10,451
So?

265
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,861
You know, no suds, no save.

266
00:12:12,861 --> 00:12:14,459
No suds, no-- Excuse me.

267
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,246
Hold on a second!

268
00:12:17,246 --> 00:12:19,225
This is my friend's machine.

269
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:20,350
Hey, hey, hey!

270
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,362
Her stuff wasn't in it!

271
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,453
Hey, hey, hey! That's not

272
00:12:23,453 --> 00:12:25,432
the rule, and you know it!

273
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:37,481
All right. Show's over.

274
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,357
Nothing to see here.

275
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,388
Okay. Let's do laundry.

276
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,479
That was amazing!

277
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:51,458
I can't even send back soup.

278
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,405
Well, that's because you're

279
00:12:54,405 --> 00:12:57,306
such a sweet, gentle....

280
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,445
Do you--? Do you--?

281
00:13:00,445 --> 00:13:02,413
Oh, hey. You must need detergent.

282
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,785
What's that?

283
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:09,218
Überweiss.

284
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:10,868
It's new. It's German.

285
00:13:10,868 --> 00:13:12,415
It's extra tough!

286
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:18,260
Rach, are you gonna separate those?

287
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,781
Oh, God.

288
00:13:20,781 --> 00:13:23,232
Am I being a total laundry spaz?

289
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,849
Am I supposed to use one machine

290
00:13:25,849 --> 00:13:28,363
for shirts and another for pants?

291
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,468
Have you never done this before?

292
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,294
Well, not myself.

293
00:13:36,294 --> 00:13:38,342
But I know other people that have.

294
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:40,849
Okay. You caught me.

295
00:13:40,849 --> 00:13:42,447
I'm a laundry virgin.

296
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,872
Don't worry.

297
00:13:45,872 --> 00:13:48,289
I'll use the gentle cycle.

298
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,814
Basically, you wanna use

299
00:13:53,814 --> 00:13:56,265
one machine for all your whites.

300
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:57,431
A whole other machine

301
00:13:57,431 --> 00:13:58,494
for your colors.

302
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:04,825
And a third for your delicates.

303
00:14:04,825 --> 00:14:10,213
That would be your bras and your underpanty things.

304
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:15,243
These are white cotton panties.

305
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,817
Would they go with whites

306
00:14:16,817 --> 00:14:18,313
or with delicates?

307
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,258
That would be a judgment call.

308
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,432
He's so cute!

309
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,233
Where did you grow up?

310
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,450
Brooklyn Heights.

311
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,530
Cleveland.

312
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:35,905
How'd that happen?

313
00:14:35,905 --> 00:14:36,536
My God!

314
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,435
What?

315
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,393
I suddenly had the feeling

316
00:14:41,393 --> 00:14:43,441
I was falling.

317
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,441
But I'm not.

318
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,385
So, you and Angela, huh?

319
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,430
Yep. Pretty much.

320
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,398
You're a lucky man.

321
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,493
Know what I miss most about her?

322
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,215
That cute nibbly noise

323
00:15:06,215 --> 00:15:08,194
she makes when she eats.

324
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:13,244
Like a happy little squirrel or a weasel.

325
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,325
I never really noticed.

326
00:15:16,325 --> 00:15:18,304
Oh, yeah, yeah. Listen for it.

327
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,252
Monica. Monica is great.

328
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,412
Yeah, she is.

329
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:27,420
But it's not gonna last.

330
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:31,225
She's too much for me in bed.

331
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,331
Sexually.

332
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,463
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.

333
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,364
Yeah, isn't he?

334
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,391
It's great to meet a smart, funny guy

335
00:15:43,391 --> 00:15:46,343
who's emotionally older than 8.

336
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,858
You know what else?

337
00:15:48,858 --> 00:15:51,338
He's unbelievable in bed!

338
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,334
My brother never even told me

339
00:15:56,334 --> 00:15:58,382
when he lost his virginity.

340
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,385
That's nice.

341
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:07,965
You can. It's like

342
00:16:07,965 --> 00:16:09,432
pulling off a Band-Aid.

343
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,214
Just do it really fast,

344
00:16:12,214 --> 00:16:14,193
and then the wound is exposed.

345
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,297
Go! Go!

346
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,445
Hi, Janice.

347
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,291
Here we go. I don't think

348
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:35,259
we should go out anymore.

349
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,325
All right.

350
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,431
Well, there you go.

351
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:54,269
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

352
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,474
This isn't about you.

353
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,796
I know! It's about

354
00:16:59,796 --> 00:17:01,309
your fear of commitment.

355
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,287
I'm not afraid.

356
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,287
Please.

357
00:17:04,287 --> 00:17:05,185
I don't!

358
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,237
I don't! I'm ready to commit anytime.

359
00:17:07,237 --> 00:17:09,250
Really?

360
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:16,847
I know this is gonna sound stupid but I feel that if I can do this if I can actually do

361
00:17:16,847 --> 00:17:21,399
my own laundry there isn't anything I can't do.

362
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,267
That does not sound stupid to me.

363
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,374
The first time I had to cook

364
00:17:27,374 --> 00:17:29,404
for myself after Carol left me--

365
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,881
I'm sorry, that's all the time

366
00:17:31,881 --> 00:17:34,247
we have. Next on Ross....

367
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:35,900
Uh-oh.

368
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,446
What?

369
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,246
Uh-oh....

370
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:41,417
Uh-oh, the laundry's done.

371
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,361
It's a song.

372
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,364
The laundry song we sing.

373
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:51,233
Uh-oh! The laundry's done

374
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,869
What's the matter?

375
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:54,268
Nothing.

376
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,431
The laundry's done

377
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,230
Come on, show me.

378
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:00,260
It's just that you left a red sock

379
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:07,185
with your whites, and now...everything's kind of pink.

380
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,217
Everything's pink?

381
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:10,755
Except for the red sock,

382
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:12,222
which is still red.

383
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,758
Don't be upset.

384
00:18:13,758 --> 00:18:15,225
It can happen to anyone.

385
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,285
But it happened to me.

386
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,263
God, I'm gonna look like

387
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,197
a big Marshmallow Peep!

388
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,200
What am I doing?

389
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,815
My father's right!

390
00:18:24,815 --> 00:18:26,328
I can't live on my own.

391
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,407
I can't even do laundry!

392
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,336
Something went wrong with Underdog

393
00:18:43,336 --> 00:18:46,220
and they couldn't inflate his head.

394
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:51,279
So anyway...his head is flopping

395
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:53,230
down Broadway, right?

396
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,796
And I'm thinking

397
00:18:55,796 --> 00:18:58,327
how inappropriate this is.

398
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,803
Something's in my eye. Could we

399
00:19:00,803 --> 00:19:03,169
check it in the light, please?

400
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,375
Oh, my God!

401
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,273
What?

402
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,846
Were we at the same table?

403
00:19:08,846 --> 00:19:13,283
It's like cocktails in Appalachia.

404
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,285
They're close.

405
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:21,281
Close? Her tongue's in his ear.

406
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:24,290
Like you've never got

407
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,286
a little rambunctious with Ross.

408
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,283
Joey, this is sick.

409
00:19:29,283 --> 00:19:33,398
It's disgusting. It's not really true, is it?

410
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,400
Who's to say what's true?

411
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,475
What were you thinking?

412
00:19:37,475 --> 00:19:39,443
I'm not proud of this, okay?

413
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:43,204
Well, maybe I am a little.

414
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,332
I'm out of here!

415
00:19:44,332 --> 00:19:45,316
Wait!

416
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,334
You like him. I want her.

417
00:19:47,334 --> 00:19:49,251
He likes you.

418
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:50,836
Really?

419
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:51,450
Yeah.

420
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:53,838
If we put our heads together,

421
00:19:53,838 --> 00:19:58,355
between the two of us we can break them up.

422
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,931
I'm sorry.

423
00:20:01,931 --> 00:20:03,330
I can't believe I did this.

424
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:05,431
I couldn't stop laughing

425
00:20:05,431 --> 00:20:07,427
at your Norman Mailer story.

426
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:15,296
Waiter? One more plate of

427
00:20:15,296 --> 00:20:17,247
chicken wings over here.

428
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:24,267
Here's the thing.

429
00:20:24,267 --> 00:20:25,279
We're different.

430
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,904
I'm bing, bing, bing.

431
00:20:26,904 --> 00:20:28,451
You're boom, boom, boom.

432
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,388
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry!

433
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,289
Are you okay?

434
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:37,299
It's just my lens. It's my lens.

435
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,394
I'll be right back.

436
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:42,419
I hit her in the eye!

437
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:43,465
In the eye!

438
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,823
This is the worst breakup

439
00:20:45,823 --> 00:20:47,370
in the history of the world!

440
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:50,312
Oh, my God!

441
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,434
How many have you had?

442
00:20:53,434 --> 00:20:55,385
I don't know. A million!

443
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,367
Chandler, easy, easy.

444
00:20:58,367 --> 00:21:00,346
Go to your happy place.

445
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,308
I'm fine, I'm fine.

446
00:21:04,308 --> 00:21:05,354
All right.

447
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,927
I'm not fine. Here she is.

448
00:21:07,927 --> 00:21:10,424
Wait here, okay? Breathe.

449
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,370
How do you do that?

450
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,287
It's like a gift.

451
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,291
We should always break up together.

452
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,455
I'd like that!

453
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,961
The clothes are clean.

454
00:21:41,961 --> 00:21:43,457
That's the important part.

455
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,385
I guess. Except everything

456
00:21:46,385 --> 00:21:48,501
looks like jammies now.

457
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,442
I'm sorry.

458
00:21:55,442 --> 00:21:57,472
Excuse me. We had this cart.

459
00:21:58,283 --> 00:21:59,346
I had a 24-inch waist.

460
00:21:59,346 --> 00:22:00,409
You lose things.

461
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:01,851
Now, come on.

462
00:22:01,851 --> 00:22:03,250
Get out of my way.

463
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,273
I'm sorry. Maybe I wasn't

464
00:22:05,273 --> 00:22:07,224
being clear. This was our cart.

465
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,260
There weren't clothes in it!

466
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:10,811
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

467
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:12,261
Quit making up rules!

468
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,323
Let go! Come on, it's my cart.

469
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:19,804
Listen, Mitzi, if you want it you're gonna have

470
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:21,271
to take me with it!

471
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,827
Yes! Did you see that?

472
00:22:29,827 --> 00:22:31,374
You were incredible.

473
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:32,916
A brand-new woman,

474
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,349
ladies and gentlemen.

475
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:36,320
Thank you. I could not have

476
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,254
done this without you.

477
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,488
More clothes in the dryer?

478
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:50,934
I'm fine. I'm fine.

479
00:22:50,934 --> 00:22:52,367
Are you sure?

480
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:56,973
Are you sure you're okay?

481
00:22:56,973 --> 00:22:58,372
Yeah.

482
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,906
Does it still hurt?

483
00:22:59,906 --> 00:23:01,402
Yeah.

484
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:05,330
What a neat idea! All your

485
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,412
clothes match. I'm gonna do this.

486
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:10,886
How'd it go?

487
00:23:10,886 --> 00:23:12,251
Excellent!

488
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,439
We ripped that couple apart

489
00:23:14,439 --> 00:23:16,521
and kept the pieces for ourselves.

490
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,329
What a beautiful story.

491
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,730
I'm fine, by the way.

492
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,226
I'm sorry.

493
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,766
Where's Chandler?

494
00:23:26,766 --> 00:23:28,262
He needed time to grieve.

495
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,433
I'm free! I'm free!

496
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,435
That ought to do it.
