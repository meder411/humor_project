1
00:00:01,421 --> 00:00:02,871
Do you think they have

2
00:00:02,871 --> 00:00:04,321
yesterday's Daily News?

3
00:00:04,424 --> 00:00:06,307
I just wanna check my horoscope,

4
00:00:06,307 --> 00:00:08,190
see if it was right.

5
00:00:09,295 --> 00:00:10,893
Oh, my God! Don't look now.

6
00:00:10,893 --> 00:00:15,262
Behind you there's a guy who can break our hearts

8
00:00:15,262 --> 00:00:17,292
and plunge us into depression.

9
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,338
Come to mama.

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,320
He's coming.

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,400
Be cool. Be cool. Be cool.

12
00:00:23,443 --> 00:00:24,825
Nice hat.

13
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,207
Thanks.

14
00:00:26,412 --> 00:00:27,862
We should do something. Whistle.

15
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,312
I'm not whistling.

16
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:30,338
Come on, do it!

17
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,475
Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.

18
00:00:38,324 --> 00:00:40,417
I can't believe you did that.

19
00:01:28,341 --> 00:01:29,774
It's all my fault.

20
00:01:29,774 --> 00:01:31,207
No, it's mine.

21
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,210
Why did I whoo-hoo?

22
00:01:33,246 --> 00:01:34,292
Was I hoping

23
00:01:34,292 --> 00:01:36,928
he'd turn around and say ''I love that sound.

25
00:01:36,928 --> 00:01:38,441
I must have you now''?

26
00:01:39,419 --> 00:01:40,869
I wish there was something

27
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:42,319
we could do.

28
00:01:45,224 --> 00:01:46,248
Hello, coma guy.

29
00:01:48,227 --> 00:01:49,222
Get up, you Girl Scout!

30
00:01:49,222 --> 00:01:50,217
Up, up, up!

31
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:51,353
What are you doing?

32
00:01:51,464 --> 00:01:53,432
Maybe nobody's tried this.

33
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:58,462
I wish we at least knew his name.

34
00:01:59,238 --> 00:02:00,301
I hate that they're

35
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:01,364
calling him John Doe.

36
00:02:01,474 --> 00:02:03,391
It's so sad. It's like he's a deer,

37
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,308
a female deer.

38
00:02:06,212 --> 00:02:08,271
Oh, I was gonna stop.

39
00:02:10,183 --> 00:02:11,343
Look at that face.

40
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:14,180
Even sleeping he looks smart.

41
00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:15,834
Yeah, but the dents in his knuckles

42
00:02:15,834 --> 00:02:17,381
mean he's artistic.

43
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:20,287
Okay. He's a lawyer who teaches

44
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:22,283
sculpting on the side.

45
00:02:22,395 --> 00:02:24,226
And he can dance.

46
00:02:25,198 --> 00:02:27,246
And he's the kind of guy who,

47
00:02:27,246 --> 00:02:32,833
when you're talking, he's listening not saying, ''I understand'' but really wondering

50
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,329
what you look like naked.

51
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,405
I wish all guys could be like him.

52
00:02:41,314 --> 00:02:42,338
I know.

53
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,354
You don't even know this guy.

54
00:02:49,455 --> 00:02:51,389
Are there no conscious men

55
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:53,323
in the city for you two?

56
00:02:54,327 --> 00:02:55,419
He doesn't have anyone.

57
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:58,224
We feel kind of responsible.

58
00:02:58,431 --> 00:03:01,195
I can't believe you said ''whoo-hoo.''

59
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,265
I don't even say ''whoo-hoo.''

60
00:03:03,369 --> 00:03:05,200
Oh, she's coming up.

61
00:03:05,271 --> 00:03:07,722
When we return, we'll talk with

62
00:03:07,722 --> 00:03:10,173
the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.

63
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:12,267
Put the kids to bed for this one.

64
00:03:12,378 --> 00:03:14,295
Don't watch this. Weekend at Bernie's

65
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:16,212
is on Showtime and HBO.

66
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:17,271
No way.

67
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,367
She's your mom.

68
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:21,318
Exactly. Weekend at Bernie's.

69
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:23,338
Dead guy getting hit

70
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:25,289
in the groin 20, 30 times.

71
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:27,888
I gotta tell you,

72
00:03:27,888 --> 00:03:29,384
I love your mom's books.

73
00:03:30,196 --> 00:03:31,293
I can't get on a plane without one.

74
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:32,390
This is so cool.

75
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:34,245
You wouldn't think so

76
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:37,801
if you were 1 1  and your friends were passing around

78
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,201
page 79 of Mistress Bitch.

79
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:42,433
I remember page 79.

80
00:03:43,242 --> 00:03:45,290
The thing after the opera

81
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,338
with the girl with the trick hip?

82
00:03:50,216 --> 00:03:51,228
I love your mom.

83
00:03:51,228 --> 00:03:52,240
I think she's a blast.

84
00:03:52,351 --> 00:03:54,319
That's because she's not your mom.

85
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,444
Oh, please. She's the--

86
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:57,517
Hi, sweetie.

87
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,359
When did ''Rigatoni'' get back from Rome?

88
00:04:04,163 --> 00:04:04,709
Last night.

89
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:05,255
Really?

90
00:04:05,364 --> 00:04:06,877
So, his plane didn't explode

91
00:04:06,877 --> 00:04:08,390
in a big ball of fire?

92
00:04:09,202 --> 00:04:10,464
Just a dream I had.

93
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,259
But, phew!

94
00:04:13,406 --> 00:04:15,169
Hey, she's on.

95
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:19,371
Nora Bing.

96
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,328
Back to the book. What is this

97
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:25,376
about you being arrested in London?

98
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:27,379
Your mom was arrested?

99
00:04:27,486 --> 00:04:29,420
I'm busy beaming with pride.

100
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:34,905
This is kind of embarrassing...but occasionally, after

102
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:36,418
I've been intimate with a man...

103
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:39,389
Why would she say that's embarrassing?

104
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,912
...I just get this craving

105
00:04:41,912 --> 00:04:43,425
for kung pao chicken.

106
00:04:44,237 --> 00:04:46,228
That's too much information.

107
00:04:50,309 --> 00:04:54,302
Needless to say, he got a huge tip.

108
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,410
Oh, God, I love her!

109
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:01,181
I think I'm having a stroke.

110
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:05,189
So how is your book tour going?

111
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:07,287
Oh, fine. I'm leaving

112
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:09,283
for New York tomorrow, which I hate.

113
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:11,454
But I get to see my son, who I love.

114
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,350
This is the way that I find out.

115
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,301
Most moms use the phone.

116
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,438
Don't take this wrong, I just

117
00:05:19,438 --> 00:05:21,406
don't see you as a mom.

118
00:05:22,174 --> 00:05:23,823
-I don't mean that bad.

119
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,472
-Oh, no. I'm a fabulous mom.

120
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:28,313
I bought my son his first condoms.

121
00:05:34,387 --> 00:05:36,480
And then he burst into flames.

122
00:05:45,398 --> 00:05:47,446
Let's see. Congress is debating

123
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:49,494
a new deficit-reduction bill.

124
00:05:50,236 --> 00:05:52,716
The mayor wants to raise subway fares.

125
00:05:52,716 --> 00:05:55,196
The high today was 45.

126
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,233
And teams played sports.

127
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:26,200
What about Glen?

128
00:06:26,372 --> 00:06:27,396
He could be a Glen.

129
00:06:28,174 --> 00:06:29,402
Not special enough.

130
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:32,277
How about Agamemnon?

131
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:35,174
Way too special.

132
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:45,282
I'm famished. What do I want?

133
00:06:45,391 --> 00:06:46,904
Please, God, don't let it be

134
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:48,417
kung pao chicken.

135
00:06:49,228 --> 00:06:50,712
You watched the show.

136
00:06:50,712 --> 00:06:52,196
What did you think?

137
00:06:52,231 --> 00:06:53,328
I think you need to come out

138
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:54,425
of your shell.

139
00:06:57,403 --> 00:06:59,303
What is this dive?

140
00:06:59,405 --> 00:07:01,373
Only you could've picked this place.

141
00:07:02,274 --> 00:07:03,804
Come on. Shut up. It's fun.

142
00:07:03,804 --> 00:07:05,334
Give me a hug.

143
00:07:06,178 --> 00:07:07,776
I heard about the divorce.

144
00:07:07,776 --> 00:07:09,374
Lesbian, huh?

145
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,647
Well, you know what they say:

146
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:16,144
Be careful what you wish for.

147
00:07:18,257 --> 00:07:19,724
I think we're ready for some tequila.

148
00:07:19,724 --> 00:07:21,191
I know I am.

149
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,255
Who's doing shots?

150
00:07:22,255 --> 00:07:23,250
Hit me.

151
00:07:23,295 --> 00:07:24,353
There you go. Ross?

152
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:26,310
I'm not really a shot-drinking

153
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,356
kind of guy.

154
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:29,361
Hi. Sorry we're late.

155
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:31,336
We kind of just, you know,

156
00:07:31,336 --> 00:07:33,270
lost track of time.

157
00:07:35,374 --> 00:07:37,308
But a man can change.

158
00:07:43,282 --> 00:07:45,409
Anyone want me to appraise anything?

159
00:07:56,395 --> 00:07:59,330
Well, I'm gonna go to tinker-town.

160
00:07:59,398 --> 00:08:00,865
Mrs. Bing, I've read

161
00:08:00,865 --> 00:08:02,332
everything you've written.

162
00:08:03,135 --> 00:08:05,131
When I read Euphoria at Midnight,

163
00:08:05,131 --> 00:08:07,127
I wanted to become a writer.

164
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:08,689
Oh, please.

165
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:10,139
If I can do it, anybody can.

166
00:08:10,276 --> 00:08:11,271
Start with half a dozen

167
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:13,828
European cities throw in 30 euphemisms

169
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:18,180
for male genitalia and you've got yourself a book.

171
00:08:19,285 --> 00:08:22,152
My mother, ladies and gentlemen.

172
00:08:25,157 --> 00:08:28,149
Yeah, any messages for room 226?

173
00:08:29,295 --> 00:08:30,825
You okay, slugger?

174
00:08:30,825 --> 00:08:32,355
Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

175
00:08:45,277 --> 00:08:47,177
What is with you tonight?

176
00:08:47,213 --> 00:08:49,408
Nothing. Nothing, nothing.

177
00:08:50,382 --> 00:08:52,179
Okay, thank you.

178
00:08:55,221 --> 00:08:57,451
It's the Italian hand-licker, isn't it?

179
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,315
No. It's the one he's licking.

180
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,328
She's supposed to be with you.

181
00:09:04,263 --> 00:09:05,321
You're good.

182
00:09:06,332 --> 00:09:08,783
I have sold 100 million copies

183
00:09:08,783 --> 00:09:11,234
of my books, and you know why?

184
00:09:11,437 --> 00:09:12,904
The girl on the cover

185
00:09:12,904 --> 00:09:14,371
with her nipples showing?

186
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,855
No, because I know how to write men

187
00:09:18,855 --> 00:09:21,335
that women fall in love with.

188
00:09:22,181 --> 00:09:24,149
I cannot sell a Paolo.

189
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,746
People will not turn 325 pages

190
00:09:25,746 --> 00:09:27,242
for a Paolo.

191
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:28,849
Come on. The guy's

192
00:09:28,849 --> 00:09:30,345
a secondary character.

193
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:32,703
He's just a complication

194
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:34,250
you eventually kill off.

195
00:09:35,361 --> 00:09:36,385
When?

196
00:09:39,164 --> 00:09:41,257
He's not a hero.

197
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:43,361
You know who our hero is?

198
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:45,232
The guy on the cover

199
00:09:45,232 --> 00:09:46,295
with his nipples showing?

200
00:09:47,273 --> 00:09:48,365
No, it's you.

201
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:49,720
Please.

202
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,266
No, really.

203
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:53,174
Come on. You're smart. You're sexy.

204
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:54,329
Right.

205
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:55,279
Yes, you are.

206
00:09:55,381 --> 00:09:57,298
The fact that you don't think you are

207
00:09:57,298 --> 00:09:59,215
makes you sexier.

208
00:09:59,285 --> 00:10:01,281
Come on, kiddo.

209
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:03,277
You're gonna be fine, believe me.

210
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,505
I'll just pee in the street.

211
00:10:34,253 --> 00:10:35,242
Is Chandler here?

212
00:10:35,454 --> 00:10:37,217
Wait. Come here.

213
00:10:38,424 --> 00:10:44,262
Okay, about last night you know Chandler, you didn't tell....

216
00:10:44,363 --> 00:10:46,411
We don't need to tell Chandler.

217
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:48,459
It was just a kiss. No big deal, right?

218
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:50,462
Right. No big deal.

219
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,430
In bizarro world.

220
00:10:56,342 --> 00:10:57,331
You broke the code.

221
00:10:57,443 --> 00:10:58,876
What code?

222
00:10:58,876 --> 00:11:00,309
You don't kiss your friend's mom.

223
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:02,330
Sisters are okay.

224
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,281
Maybe a hot-looking aunt.

225
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:06,477
But not a mom. Never a mom.

226
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:11,389
What are you guys doing out here?

227
00:11:12,191 --> 00:11:13,755
Joey and I had discussed getting

228
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:15,319
in an early morning racquetball game.

229
00:11:17,196 --> 00:11:20,222
But apparently somebody overslept.

230
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:23,498
Well, you don't have your racquet.

231
00:11:24,236 --> 00:11:25,333
No. No, I don't

232
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,430
because it's being restrung.

233
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:29,298
Somebody was supposed to bring me one.

234
00:11:30,342 --> 00:11:31,838
Well, you didn't call

235
00:11:31,838 --> 00:11:33,334
and leave your grip size.

236
00:11:35,447 --> 00:11:36,931
You guys are spending

237
00:11:36,931 --> 00:11:38,415
way too much time together.

238
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,251
I'm scum. I'm scum.

239
00:11:43,355 --> 00:11:44,401
How could you let this happen?

240
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:45,447
I don't know.

241
00:11:46,258 --> 00:11:48,226
It's not like she's a regular mom.

242
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:50,227
She's sexy. She's....

243
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:52,354
You don't think my mom's sexy?

244
00:11:53,465 --> 00:11:56,332
Well, not in the same way.

245
00:11:56,435 --> 00:11:58,403
I'll have you know, Gloria Tribbiani

246
00:11:58,403 --> 00:12:00,371
was a handsome woman in her day.

247
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:03,721
You think it's easy giving birth

248
00:12:03,721 --> 00:12:05,268
to seven children?

249
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,775
Okay, I think we're getting

250
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:10,271
into a weird area here.

251
00:12:12,384 --> 00:12:14,181
What are you doing here?

252
00:12:15,387 --> 00:12:17,287
Not playing racquetball.

253
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:21,387
He forgot to leave his grip size.

254
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:23,383
He didn't get the goggles.

255
00:12:25,431 --> 00:12:28,229
Sounds like you two have issues.

256
00:12:31,303 --> 00:12:32,327
Goodbye, baby.

257
00:12:34,506 --> 00:12:37,236
Do they wait for me to do this?

258
00:12:43,315 --> 00:12:44,811
Are you gonna tell him?

259
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:46,307
Why would I tell him?

260
00:12:46,418 --> 00:12:49,216
If you don't, his mother might.

261
00:12:50,322 --> 00:12:52,415
What are you guys doing here?

262
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:55,418
He's not even wearing a jock strap.

263
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,191
What did I ask?

264
00:13:17,382 --> 00:13:19,213
What are you doing here?

265
00:13:19,284 --> 00:13:20,797
Nothing. I just thought

266
00:13:20,797 --> 00:13:24,184
I'd stop by, you know, after that I, you know.

268
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:26,189
So, what are you doing here?

269
00:13:27,226 --> 00:13:29,194
I'm not really here.

270
00:13:29,294 --> 00:13:31,342
I just thought I'd drop these off

271
00:13:31,342 --> 00:13:33,390
on the way. My way.

272
00:13:36,235 --> 00:13:41,201
Do you come here a lot without me?

274
00:13:41,306 --> 00:13:43,297
No, no, no.

275
00:13:46,411 --> 00:13:48,311
Do you think he's doing any better

276
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:50,211
than he was this morning?

277
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,214
How would I know? I wasn't here.

278
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:55,866
Really? Not even

279
00:13:55,866 --> 00:13:57,413
to change his pajamas?

280
00:14:01,393 --> 00:14:02,360
Oh, my God.

281
00:14:03,162 --> 00:14:04,259
You're my friend.

282
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:05,356
I had to tell you.

283
00:14:06,165 --> 00:14:07,359
I can't believe it.

284
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:10,164
Paolo kissed my mom?

285
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,783
I don't know if you noticed,

286
00:14:12,783 --> 00:14:14,296
but he drank a lot.

287
00:14:14,406 --> 00:14:17,273
I mean, you know how he gets--

288
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:21,212
I can't do this. I did it.

289
00:14:21,313 --> 00:14:22,359
It was me. I'm sorry.

290
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:23,405
I kissed your mom.

291
00:14:24,283 --> 00:14:25,272
What?

292
00:14:25,484 --> 00:14:27,935
I was upset about Rachel and

293
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:35,792
I had too much tequila, and Nora Mrs. Mom, your Bing, was...being nice.

296
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,191
But nothing happened.

297
00:14:37,296 --> 00:14:38,285
Nothing. Ask Joey.

298
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,914
Joey came in--

299
00:14:39,914 --> 00:14:41,398
You knew about this?

300
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:44,396
You know, knowledge is a tricky thing.

301
00:14:45,337 --> 00:14:47,430
Why didn't you tell me?

302
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,838
You're lucky I caught them, or else

303
00:14:49,838 --> 00:14:51,436
who knows what would've happened?

304
00:14:52,244 --> 00:14:53,336
Thanks, man. Big help.

305
00:14:54,313 --> 00:14:56,304
What the hell were you thinking?

306
00:14:56,415 --> 00:14:58,406
I wasn't. I don't know. I--

307
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,315
No one knows the crap I go through

308
00:15:00,315 --> 00:15:02,180
with my mom more than you.

309
00:15:02,254 --> 00:15:03,266
I know.

310
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:04,278
I can't believe you did this.

311
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:05,771
Me neither.

312
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,153
I'm mad at you too.

313
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:08,709
Why are you mad at me--?

314
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,159
Let me slam the door.

315
00:15:11,263 --> 00:15:13,259
I didn't kiss her. See what happens

316
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:15,255
when you break the code?

317
00:15:28,413 --> 00:15:29,909
''A Woman Undone,

318
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:31,405
by Rachel Karen Greene.''

319
00:15:32,184 --> 00:15:33,731
I thought I'd give it a shot.

320
00:15:33,731 --> 00:15:35,278
I'm on the first chapter.

321
00:15:35,387 --> 00:15:37,884
Do you think his ''love stick'' can be

322
00:15:37,884 --> 00:15:40,381
''liberated from its denim prison''?

323
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:44,319
Yeah, I'd say so.

324
00:15:44,496 --> 00:15:48,193
And there's no ''J'' in ''engorged.''

325
00:15:53,338 --> 00:15:54,771
You going to the hospital tonight?

326
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:56,204
No. You?

327
00:15:56,408 --> 00:15:57,432
No. You?

328
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:02,270
You just asked me.

329
00:16:02,347 --> 00:16:04,338
Maybe it was a trick question.

330
00:16:06,285 --> 00:16:08,378
Rachel, can we do this now?

331
00:16:10,355 --> 00:16:12,346
I am so hot.

332
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:15,726
Here's my mom and dad

333
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:17,193
on their wedding day.

334
00:16:17,296 --> 00:16:20,288
Now, you tell me she's not a knockout.

335
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:24,818
I can't believe this conversation.

336
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,469
Just try to picture her not pregnant.

337
00:16:28,373 --> 00:16:30,824
Central Perk is proud to present

338
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,275
Miss Phoebe Buffay.

339
00:16:34,313 --> 00:16:35,280
Thanks.

340
00:16:37,382 --> 00:16:39,833
I'd like to start with a song

341
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:43,854
about a man I recently met who's come to be

343
00:16:43,854 --> 00:16:45,321
very important to me.

344
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:52,380
You don't have to be awake

345
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,331
To be my man

346
00:16:56,435 --> 00:16:58,886
Long as you have brain waves

347
00:16:58,886 --> 00:17:01,337
I'll be there to hold your hand

348
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:05,200
Though we just met the other day

349
00:17:05,344 --> 00:17:09,144
There's something I have got to say

350
00:17:10,182 --> 00:17:11,666
Thank you very much.

351
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:13,150
I'm gonna take a short break.

352
00:17:15,354 --> 00:17:19,154
That was Phoebe Buffay, everybody.

353
00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:21,692
What the hell was that?

354
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:23,159
Phoebe just started--

355
00:17:23,228 --> 00:17:25,258
I was talking to Joey.

356
00:17:25,258 --> 00:17:27,288
All right, there, mother-kisser?

357
00:17:32,237 --> 00:17:33,363
''Mother-kisser.''

358
00:17:35,273 --> 00:17:36,297
I'll shut up.

359
00:17:36,408 --> 00:17:40,778
I know you're still mad at me but there were two people

361
00:17:40,778 --> 00:17:42,245
there that night.

362
00:17:42,414 --> 00:17:43,910
There were two sets of lips.

363
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,406
I expect this from her.

364
00:17:46,284 --> 00:17:48,411
She's always been a Freudian nightmare.

365
00:17:49,187 --> 00:17:52,213
Then why don't you say something?

366
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,774
Because it's complicated.

367
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:55,258
It's complex.

368
00:17:55,394 --> 00:17:57,191
You kissed my mom.

369
00:18:00,432 --> 00:18:03,128
We're rehearsing a Greek play.

370
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:05,236
That's funny.

371
00:18:05,236 --> 00:18:06,203
Are we done now?

372
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:07,801
You mean you're not gonna

373
00:18:07,801 --> 00:18:09,331
tell her how you feel?

374
00:18:10,142 --> 00:18:11,655
Just because you played

375
00:18:11,655 --> 00:18:14,758
tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her.

377
00:18:14,758 --> 00:18:16,271
You can't talk to her.

378
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:17,763
Okay. ''You can't''?

379
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,145
Or you can't?

380
00:18:20,285 --> 00:18:21,377
Okay, that's my finger.

381
00:18:22,187 --> 00:18:24,348
Okay, that's my knee.

382
00:18:25,157 --> 00:18:26,249
Still doing the play.

383
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:36,293
What did you do with him?

384
00:18:40,405 --> 00:18:41,389
You're awake.

385
00:18:41,389 --> 00:18:42,373
Look at you.

386
00:18:43,175 --> 00:18:44,403
How do you feel?

387
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,201
A little woozy, but basically okay.

388
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:49,270
Gosh, you look good.

389
00:18:49,314 --> 00:18:50,406
I feel good.

390
00:18:52,217 --> 00:18:53,377
Who are you?

391
00:18:53,418 --> 00:18:54,368
Sorry.

392
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:55,318
I'm Phoebe.

393
00:18:55,387 --> 00:18:56,803
I'm Monica.

394
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,219
I've been caring for you.

395
00:18:58,323 --> 00:18:59,290
We both have.

396
00:18:59,424 --> 00:19:00,874
The Etch A Sketch is from you?

397
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:02,324
Actually, me.

398
00:19:03,128 --> 00:19:04,225
I got you the foot massager.

399
00:19:04,225 --> 00:19:05,322
I shaved you.

400
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,795
I read to you.

401
00:19:06,795 --> 00:19:08,160
I sang.

402
00:19:10,235 --> 00:19:11,327
Well, thanks.

403
00:19:12,137 --> 00:19:13,183
Oh, my pleasure.

404
00:19:13,183 --> 00:19:14,229
You're welcome.

405
00:19:14,272 --> 00:19:17,241
So I guess I'll see you around.

406
00:19:18,343 --> 00:19:20,243
What? That's it?

407
00:19:21,146 --> 00:19:22,272
''See you around''?

408
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,876
What do you want me to say?

409
00:19:23,876 --> 00:19:25,372
I don't know.

410
00:19:26,184 --> 00:19:29,149
Maybe ''That was nice.''

412
00:19:29,254 --> 00:19:30,346
''It meant something to me.''

413
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:33,254
''I'll call you.''

414
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:35,839
Okay. I'll call you.

415
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,386
I don't think you mean that.

416
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:43,167
This is so typical.

417
00:19:43,301 --> 00:19:47,465
You know, we give and we give and we give.

419
00:19:48,206 --> 00:19:50,265
And we just get nothing back.

420
00:19:50,308 --> 00:19:52,287
And then one day, you wake up,

421
00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:54,266
and it's, ''See you around.''

422
00:19:56,381 --> 00:19:58,178
Let's go, Phoebe.

423
00:20:00,218 --> 00:20:01,765
You know what?

424
00:20:01,765 --> 00:20:03,312
We thought you were different.

425
00:20:03,388 --> 00:20:05,481
But I guess it was just the coma.

426
00:20:16,301 --> 00:20:18,297
The car's waiting. I just wanted

427
00:20:18,297 --> 00:20:20,293
to drop off my book for your friends.

428
00:20:20,338 --> 00:20:22,289
Autographed.

429
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:24,240
And give you a goodbye kiss.

430
00:20:24,342 --> 00:20:25,826
Here's the kiss,

431
00:20:25,826 --> 00:20:27,310
here's the goodbye....

432
00:20:27,445 --> 00:20:29,845
Anything you want from Lisbon?

433
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:32,245
Just knowing you're there is enough.

434
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:34,317
All right. Well, be good.

435
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:36,217
I love you.

436
00:20:39,257 --> 00:20:41,350
You kissed my best Ross.

437
00:20:43,428 --> 00:20:46,226
Or something to that effect.

438
00:20:52,337 --> 00:20:54,271
Look, it was stupid.

439
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:55,351
Really stupid.

440
00:20:55,351 --> 00:20:56,363
Really stupid.

441
00:20:58,543 --> 00:21:01,205
I don't even know how it happened.

442
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:03,796
I'm sorry, honey. I promise

443
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:06,213
it will never happen again.

444
00:21:06,318 --> 00:21:08,218
Really, really stupid.

445
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,413
Really, really stupid.

446
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,253
Are we okay now?

447
00:21:13,253 --> 00:21:14,316
Yeah.

448
00:21:14,492 --> 00:21:16,187
No.

449
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:22,812
The forbidden love

450
00:21:22,812 --> 00:21:24,325
of a man and his door.

451
00:21:26,304 --> 00:21:27,851
He told her off. And not just

452
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:29,398
about the kiss.

453
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:30,430
You're kidding?

454
00:21:31,243 --> 00:21:32,790
He said, ''When are you gonna

455
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,337
start being a mom?''

456
00:21:34,412 --> 00:21:35,436
Then she said:

457
00:21:36,248 --> 00:21:38,296
''The question is, when are you gonna

458
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:40,344
realize I have a bomb?''

459
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,354
Are you sure she didn't say:

460
00:21:44,422 --> 00:21:46,890
''When are you gonna grow up

461
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,358
and realize I am your mom?''

462
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:52,979
That makes more sense.

463
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,429
You think?

464
00:21:56,268 --> 00:21:57,360
What's going on now?

465
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,221
I don't know. I've been standing here

466
00:22:00,221 --> 00:22:02,172
spelling it out for you.

467
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,275
I don't hear anything. Wait.

468
00:22:05,377 --> 00:22:06,366
What do you see?

469
00:22:07,178 --> 00:22:08,224
It's hard to tell.

470
00:22:08,224 --> 00:22:09,270
They're tiny and upside down.

471
00:22:09,381 --> 00:22:10,405
Wait, wait, wait.

472
00:22:11,216 --> 00:22:12,712
They're walking away.

473
00:22:12,712 --> 00:22:14,208
They're walking away.

474
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:16,353
No, they're not. They're coming

475
00:22:16,353 --> 00:22:18,287
right at us. Run!

476
00:22:20,425 --> 00:22:21,858
Are you okay, kiddo?

477
00:22:21,858 --> 00:22:23,291
Yeah, I'm okay.

478
00:22:23,395 --> 00:22:25,295
All right. You be good.

479
00:22:25,397 --> 00:22:27,228
Drive safe.

480
00:22:29,234 --> 00:22:30,263
Mrs. Bing.

481
00:22:30,263 --> 00:22:31,292
Mr. Geller.

482
00:22:40,312 --> 00:22:41,404
You mean that?

483
00:22:42,347 --> 00:22:43,439
Yeah, why not?

484
00:22:46,318 --> 00:22:48,309
So I told her.

485
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,387
How did it go?

486
00:22:49,387 --> 00:22:50,354
Awful. Awful.

487
00:22:50,522 --> 00:22:52,353
Couldn't have gone worse.

488
00:22:53,425 --> 00:22:54,875
Well, how do you feel?

489
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,325
Pretty good.

490
00:22:58,363 --> 00:22:59,421
I told her.

491
00:23:00,198 --> 00:23:01,392
Well, see?

492
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,230
So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea,

493
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,260
me kissing your mom, huh?

494
00:23:06,371 --> 00:23:07,884
But we don't have to

495
00:23:07,884 --> 00:23:09,397
go down that road.

496
00:23:15,413 --> 00:23:20,298
This is just the first chapter and I want your absolute

498
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:22,380
honest opinion. Okay?

499
00:23:23,288 --> 00:23:25,284
And on page two, he's not reaching

500
00:23:25,284 --> 00:23:27,280
for her ''heaving beasts.''

501
00:23:29,194 --> 00:23:30,491
She could have heaving beasts.

502
00:23:31,396 --> 00:23:34,388
Right, but in this case she doesn't.

503
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,289
What's a ''niffle''?

504
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:37,868
You can usually find them

505
00:23:37,868 --> 00:23:39,335
on the heaving beasts.

506
00:23:41,406 --> 00:23:43,431
Okay, so I'm not a great typist.

507
00:23:44,242 --> 00:23:46,238
Did you get to the part

508
00:23:46,238 --> 00:23:48,234
about his ''huge, throbbing pens''?

509
00:23:48,446 --> 00:23:50,425
You don't wanna be around

510
00:23:50,425 --> 00:23:52,404
when he starts writing with those.

511
00:23:53,351 --> 00:23:55,342
That's it. Give them back.

512
00:23:56,254 --> 00:23:58,319
Wait, I just got to the part

513
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:00,384
about her ''public hair.''
