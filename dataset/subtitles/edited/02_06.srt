1
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:04,236
Who the winny-binny boy?

2
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:07,234
You the winny-winny-binny-binny boy!

3
00:00:07,234 --> 00:00:09,230
Yes.

4
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:12,434
Now, don't cry.

5
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:15,237
Don't cry.

6
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:19,247
Why is he still crying?

7
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:21,920
Don't worry. It's nothing that can't

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,388
be solved by ''happy keys.''

9
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:27,254
I feel better when someone

10
00:00:27,254 --> 00:00:29,250
shakes jagged metal in my face.

11
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,262
All right, here.

12
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:33,455
Let me hold him for a sec.

13
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:35,359
Here we go.

14
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,369
There we are.

15
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,398
Maybe it's me.

16
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:42,486
Don't be silly. Ben loves you.

17
00:00:42,486 --> 00:00:44,465
He's being Mr. Cranky Pants.

18
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:46,791
You know, I once dated

19
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:48,304
a Miss Cranky Pants.

20
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:51,382
Lovely girl. Kind of moody.

21
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,286
There we go. All better.

22
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,478
There's my little boy.

23
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,288
Can I see something?

24
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:20,860
Cool!

25
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,441
He hates me. My nephew hates me!

26
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,913
I'm unemployed and he hates me.

27
00:01:24,913 --> 00:01:26,443
Don't do this.

28
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,346
You're just unemployed.

29
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:31,823
What if my own baby hates me?

30
00:01:31,823 --> 00:01:33,290
What do I do?

31
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,553
Monica, this is nuts!

32
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,291
You know how long it'll be

33
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:39,287
before you have to deal with this?

34
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,496
You don't even have a boyfriend yet.

35
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,364
Joey, she does not look fat.

36
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,317
Here you go.

37
00:02:35,317 --> 00:02:36,380
Hey, Mon.

38
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,394
Goo, goo, goo!

39
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:46,414
That is so funny!

40
00:02:46,414 --> 00:02:47,563
Let me see that a sec.

41
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,907
You okay, Ross?

42
00:02:56,907 --> 00:02:58,306
I don't know.

43
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,405
What's in this pie?

44
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,813
I don't know. Butter and eggs,

45
00:03:03,813 --> 00:03:05,411
flour and lime and kiwi--

46
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:08,215
Kiwi? Kiwi?!

47
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,219
You said it was key lime.

48
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,291
No, I said kiwi lime.

49
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,259
That's what makes it special.

50
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:17,225
That's what's gonna kill me.

51
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:19,457
I'm allergic to kiwi.

52
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,284
No, you're not. You're allergic

53
00:03:22,284 --> 00:03:24,235
to lobster, peanuts and--

54
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,364
Oh, my God!

55
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,840
It's definitely getting worse.

56
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,240
Is your tongue swelling up?

57
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:33,862
Either that or my mouth

58
00:03:33,862 --> 00:03:35,346
is getting smaller!

59
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:38,245
We're going to the hospital.

60
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:39,363
Is he okay?

61
00:03:39,363 --> 00:03:40,375
He's gotta get a shot.

62
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:42,353
You know, actually

63
00:03:42,353 --> 00:03:44,253
it's getting better. It is.

64
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,403
Let's not go.

65
00:03:45,403 --> 00:03:46,449
Anyone for Scrabble?

66
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,461
Jacket, now!

67
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,878
What about Ben? We can't

68
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:53,493
bring a baby to the hospital.

69
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,460
We'll watch him.

70
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:57,462
I don't think so.

71
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,251
I have seven Catholic sisters.

72
00:04:01,251 --> 00:04:03,230
I take care of hundreds of kids.

73
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,809
We wanna do it. Don't we?

74
00:04:05,809 --> 00:04:10,339
I was gonna play basketball but I guess that's out the window.

76
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:12,813
If you take him for a walk,

77
00:04:12,813 --> 00:04:14,309
remember his hat.

78
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,870
There's milk in the fridge

79
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,320
and extra diapers.

80
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,220
Hat, milk....

81
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:20,775
Got it!

82
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:22,225
Let's go.

83
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,232
Consider it done!

84
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,837
You understood that?

85
00:04:33,837 --> 00:04:36,237
My uncle Sal has a really big tongue.

86
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:38,810
Is he the one

87
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,243
with the beautiful wife?

88
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,419
Want to hear the song

89
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:49,353
I'm singing this afternoon?

90
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,936
I wrote it this morning in the shower.

91
00:04:50,936 --> 00:04:52,483
Okay.

92
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,425
I'm in the shower

93
00:04:56,425 --> 00:04:58,490
And I'm writing a song

94
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:03,199
Stop me if you've heard it

95
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:09,297
My skin is soapy and my hair is wet

96
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:13,403
And Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget

97
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,380
Rachel, sweetheart,

98
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,410
could I see you for a minute?

99
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,451
What's up?

100
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,454
FYI:

101
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,292
I've decided to pay a professional

102
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:33,322
musician to play on Sundays.

103
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,429
Her name's Stephanie something.

104
00:05:35,429 --> 00:05:37,425
She's supposed to be very good.

105
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:39,750
But what about Phoebe?

106
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,434
Rachel it's not that your friend is bad.

108
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:50,413
It's that she's so bad...she makes me want to put my finger

110
00:05:50,413 --> 00:05:54,480
through my eye into my brain and swirl it around.

112
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,354
Okay, so you're not a fan.

113
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,857
But, I mean, come on.

114
00:06:01,857 --> 00:06:03,421
You cannot do this to her.

115
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,425
Oh, no.

116
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,393
I have to do this?

117
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:11,198
Lather, rinse, repeat

118
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,296
And lather, rinse, repeat

119
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:17,206
And lather, rinse, repeat

120
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,210
As needed

121
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,318
We didn't bring enough.

122
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,916
Did you forget to pack

123
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,412
the baby's anvil?

124
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,248
It'll be worth it.

125
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,325
It's a fact that women love babies.

126
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,443
Women love guys who love babies.

127
00:06:37,443 --> 00:06:39,525
It's the sensitive thing.

128
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,262
Aim him at that pack of babes.

129
00:06:42,262 --> 00:06:44,258
Maybe one will break away.

130
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,337
Wait, forget them.

131
00:06:46,337 --> 00:06:48,237
We got one. Hard left.

132
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,258
Give me the baby.

133
00:06:49,258 --> 00:06:50,242
I got him.

134
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,907
Come on, seriously.

135
00:06:51,907 --> 00:06:53,471
Oh, seriously you want him?

136
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,372
Hello.

137
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,278
Hello.

138
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,477
Who is this cutie-pie?

139
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:04,382
Well, don't think me immodest, but me.

141
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,739
Want to smell him?

142
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:09,286
We're talking about the baby?

143
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,246
He's got that great baby smell.

144
00:07:14,246 --> 00:07:16,294
Get a whiff of his head.

145
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:20,201
My uterus just skipped a beat.

146
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,431
What'd I tell you?

147
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,220
It's great you're doing this.

148
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,199
Well, we are great guys.

149
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:27,775
My brother and his boyfriend

150
00:07:27,775 --> 00:07:29,305
are trying to adopt.

151
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:32,317
What agency did you two go through?

152
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,253
But this is my gig.

153
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:39,450
This is where I play.

154
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,421
My name is written out there in chalk.

155
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,228
You know, you can't just erase chalk.

156
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,265
Honey, I'm sorry.

157
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,382
And he's going to

158
00:07:51,382 --> 00:07:52,428
be pay this woman?

159
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,355
Why doesn't he give her a throne

160
00:07:54,355 --> 00:07:56,238
and a crown?

161
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,759
And, like, a gold stick

162
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:01,176
with a ball on top?

163
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,331
Terry is a jerk! That's why we say,

164
00:08:03,331 --> 00:08:05,282
''Terry's a jerk!''

165
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:08,285
That's where that came from.

166
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,301
Yeah, okay. You probably did

167
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:13,280
everything you could.

168
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,375
Okay, you know what? Let me just see

169
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,423
what else I can do.

170
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,247
All right. Let her go on after

171
00:08:22,247 --> 00:08:24,295
Stephanie whatever-her-name-is.

172
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,498
You won't be here. Don't pay her.

173
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,887
I don't know.

174
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:30,434
I'll clean the cappuccino machine!

175
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,757
You don't clean

176
00:08:32,757 --> 00:08:34,304
the cappuccino machine?

177
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,444
Of course I clean it.

178
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,446
I mean, I will clean it.

179
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,319
I mean, I will clean it.

180
00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:45,418
All right, fine!

181
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:51,344
Done.

182
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:52,259
Really?

183
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,322
Who's working for you, babe?

184
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,850
Oh, my God! This is so exciting!

185
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:59,267
How much am I gonna get?

186
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,396
What?

187
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,703
You said he's paying

188
00:09:02,703 --> 00:09:04,199
the people who play.

189
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,845
I meant, he's paying that other woman

190
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:09,313
because she's a professional.

191
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:11,746
I'm not gonna be the only one

192
00:09:11,746 --> 00:09:13,310
not getting paid.

193
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,398
But Pheebs--

194
00:09:14,398 --> 00:09:15,410
No, I'm sorry, no!

195
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,337
No, I'm not some sloppy second,

196
00:09:18,337 --> 00:09:20,385
you know, charity band.

197
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:24,846
There are thousands of places where people would pay

199
00:09:24,846 --> 00:09:26,296
to hear me play.

200
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,300
When I play, I play for me

201
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,392
I don't need your charity

202
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,300
Thank you!

203
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,893
I'm not getting a shot.

204
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:45,746
They can take the needle and squirt it in my mouth.

206
00:09:45,746 --> 00:09:47,242
Like a squirt gun.

207
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,254
See what the doctor says.

208
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,289
They've got to do something.

209
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:53,223
These are the '90s.

210
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,452
Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin.

211
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:57,893
I see someone's having

212
00:09:57,893 --> 00:09:59,457
a little allergic reaction.

213
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,796
Doctor, can I see you

214
00:10:01,796 --> 00:10:03,326
for just a moment?

215
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,449
My brother has a slight phobia

216
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:08,428
about needles.

217
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,357
Did you tell him

218
00:10:10,357 --> 00:10:12,240
about my squirt gun idea?

219
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:17,364
My brother would like to know if there's a way

221
00:10:17,364 --> 00:10:19,247
to treat this orally?

222
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,849
Under these circumstances, it has to

223
00:10:21,849 --> 00:10:24,346
be an injection and it has to be now.

224
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,550
So?

225
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,357
Have a seat. The doctor says

226
00:10:30,357 --> 00:10:32,353
it's gotta be a needle.

227
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,895
You're just gonna have to be brave.

228
00:10:34,895 --> 00:10:37,392
Can you do that for me?

229
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,517
Okay.

230
00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:40,563
Okay. Oh, boy!

231
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,502
You are doing so good.

232
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,505
You want to squeeze my hand?

233
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,504
Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.

234
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,379
Honey, really.

235
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:52,476
Don't squeeze it so hard!

236
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,418
Ross, let go of my hand!

237
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,943
Good. Next time we pick up women we should go to the park

239
00:11:01,943 --> 00:11:03,427
and make out.

240
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,322
Taxi! Taxi!

241
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:10,459
Hey, look at that talent.

242
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,329
Just practicing. You're good.

243
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,271
Carry on.

244
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,366
Wait, wait, wait!

245
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:22,243
Hey, you. He is just adorable.

246
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,311
Can you tell him that?

247
00:11:24,311 --> 00:11:26,341
Because he thinks he looks too pink.

248
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,801
What are you guys out doing today?

249
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:31,348
We're not out.

250
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,374
We're two hetero guys

251
00:11:34,374 --> 00:11:38,775
hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend,

253
00:11:38,775 --> 00:11:41,255
doing the usual straight-guy stuff.

254
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,462
You done?

255
00:11:42,462 --> 00:11:43,457
Yeah.

256
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,463
There's our stop.

257
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,467
Get out of here! This is our stop.

258
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,475
You guys live here too?

259
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,392
We live in the building

260
00:11:52,392 --> 00:11:53,507
by the sidewalk.

261
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,283
Do you know it?

262
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,968
Since we're neighbors, what do you say

263
00:12:00,968 --> 00:12:03,419
we get together for a drink?

264
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,252
So you wanna go to Marquel's?

265
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,356
Sure, they love us.

266
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,358
Where's your baby?

267
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,240
Ben! Ben!

268
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,293
That's good. Maybe he'll

269
00:12:25,293 --> 00:12:27,244
hear you and pull the cord!

270
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,308
Stop the bus! Hey!

271
00:12:28,308 --> 00:12:29,337
No!

272
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:30,877
We need the baby!

273
00:12:30,877 --> 00:12:32,373
Wait!

274
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,435
You sure it didn't break?

275
00:12:38,435 --> 00:12:39,481
It hurts.

276
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,353
No, it's just a good bone bruise.

277
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:46,378
And right here is the puncture wound

278
00:12:46,378 --> 00:12:48,460
from your ring.

279
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,365
I'm really sorry.

280
00:12:50,365 --> 00:12:51,462
It's okay.

281
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,363
Sorry.

282
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:57,408
Sorry! Hey! I got my ''S''s back!

283
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:00,340
Which we can celebrate later.

284
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,442
Celebrate. Celebrate....

285
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,250
He was a double, double

286
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:09,446
Double-jointed boy

287
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,219
Hey, so are you the professional

288
00:13:13,219 --> 00:13:15,215
guitar player?

289
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,258
Yeah, I'm Stephanie.

290
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,442
Right. My name was on there.

291
00:13:19,442 --> 00:13:21,421
Now it just says carrot cake.

292
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,248
Okay.

293
00:13:25,248 --> 00:13:27,227
So how many chords do you know?

294
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:28,838
All of them.

295
00:13:28,838 --> 00:13:30,237
So you know D?

296
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:32,890
Yeah.

297
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:34,437
Okay. Do you know A-minor?

298
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,915
Okay, do you know

299
00:13:37,915 --> 00:13:40,349
how to go from D to A-minor?

300
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:41,868
Yeah.

301
00:13:41,868 --> 00:13:43,284
Okay.

302
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:46,390
So does your guitar have a strap?

303
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,306
No.

304
00:13:49,306 --> 00:13:50,352
Mine does.

305
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,269
Stephanie knows all the chords

306
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,330
Come on! Pick up, pick up! Hello.

307
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,371
Transit Authority? Yes. Hello.

308
00:14:04,371 --> 00:14:06,401
I'm doing research for a book.

309
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,329
I was wondering what somebody might do

310
00:14:09,329 --> 00:14:12,213
if they left a baby on a city bus.

311
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,319
Yes, I realize that would be stupid.

312
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:18,254
We lost a car seat on a bus today.

313
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,904
It's white plastic

314
00:14:19,904 --> 00:14:21,451
and it fits onto a stroller.

315
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,320
And there was a baby in it.

316
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,322
He wants to talk to you again.

317
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,948
Everybody, let's give a warm

318
00:14:29,948 --> 00:14:31,529
Central Perk welcome to--

319
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:33,755
Terry's a jerk

320
00:14:33,755 --> 00:14:35,239
And he won't let me work

321
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,242
And I hate Central Perk

322
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,381
To Stephanie Schiffer!

323
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,806
I'd like to start with a song I wrote

324
00:14:51,806 --> 00:14:54,257
for the first man I ever loved.

325
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,388
Zachary--

326
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:01,399
Are all invited to bite me

327
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,393
We're the guys that called

328
00:15:12,393 --> 00:15:14,344
about the baby! Is he here?

329
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,440
He's here.

330
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,216
Is one of you the father?

331
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,287
That's me.

332
00:15:22,287 --> 00:15:23,254
I'm him.

333
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:29,420
Actually, we're both the father.

334
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,904
Oh, Ben!

335
00:15:39,904 --> 00:15:41,371
Hey, buddy.

336
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,863
Tell me you know

337
00:15:48,863 --> 00:15:50,347
which one is our baby.

338
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:52,879
One has ducks on his shirt

339
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,375
and one has clowns.

340
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,465
And Ben was definitely wearing ducks.

341
00:15:56,465 --> 00:15:58,444
Or clowns.

342
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,374
That one's Ben! Remember, he had

343
00:16:02,374 --> 00:16:04,422
that little mole by his mouth!

344
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,323
Hey, Ben! Remember us?

345
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,402
Okay, the mole came off.

346
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,229
What are we gonna do?

347
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,302
Flip for it.

348
00:16:16,302 --> 00:16:17,297
Ducks or clowns.

349
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,334
We're gonna flip for the baby?

350
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,312
All right, call it in the air.

351
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,378
Heads.

352
00:16:24,378 --> 00:16:25,441
Heads, it is.

353
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,423
We have to assign heads to something!

354
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:35,359
Right! Okay.

355
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:38,441
Ducks is heads

356
00:16:38,441 --> 00:16:40,420
because ducks have heads.

357
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,851
What kind of scary-ass clowns

358
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:48,432
came to your birthday?

359
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,379
Hey.

360
00:19:45,379 --> 00:19:46,442
Oh, hi.

361
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,414
Here. I thought you might be cold.

362
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,314
Thank you.

363
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,397
Look at you!

364
00:19:59,397 --> 00:20:00,364
You did well.

365
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,225
8 dollars and 27 cents.

366
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,901
But not really

367
00:20:05,901 --> 00:20:07,533
because I put in the first two.

368
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,252
Just to get the ball rolling

369
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:12,231
and to make myself feel better.

370
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,894
Do you?

371
00:20:13,894 --> 00:20:15,344
No.

372
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,359
This whole playing for money thing

373
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:19,338
is so not good for me.

374
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,915
I don't know, when I sang

375
00:20:21,915 --> 00:20:28,384
''Su-Su-Suicide''...I got, like, $1 .75.

377
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:30,489
But then ''Smelly Cat''?

378
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:36,263
I got 25 cents and a condom.

379
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,365
So, you know, now I just feel

380
00:20:39,365 --> 00:20:41,361
really bad for ''Smelly Cat.''

381
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,438
Honey, I don't think

382
00:20:45,438 --> 00:20:47,468
everybody gets ''Smelly Cat.''

383
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,396
I mean, if all you've ever actually

384
00:20:50,396 --> 00:20:52,512
had are healthy pets, then whoosh!

385
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:57,317
But it's not even that, you know?

386
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,822
I played my songs

387
00:20:58,822 --> 00:21:00,255
because it made me happy.

388
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,338
Now it's just all

389
00:21:02,338 --> 00:21:04,317
about the money, you know?

390
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,257
People missed you in there.

391
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:10,864
In fact, there was a request

392
00:21:10,864 --> 00:21:12,360
for ''Smelly Cat.''

393
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:14,364
Really? From who?

394
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,231
Well, me.

395
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,256
I know it's not your big money song,

396
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,269
but it's my favorite.

397
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,383
Hi. Did I accidentally drop a condom

398
00:21:27,383 --> 00:21:29,482
in your case?

399
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,857
It's kind of an emergency.

400
00:21:34,857 --> 00:21:36,256
Yeah.

401
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:37,825
Here you go.

402
00:21:37,825 --> 00:21:38,388
Thanks.

403
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,488
Hey, Christine! I got it!

404
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,790
I want to thank you

405
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,274
for being there for me.

406
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,468
Sorry I almost broke your hand.

407
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,490
That's okay.

408
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,469
I'm sorry I poisoned you.

409
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,949
Remember when I jammed

410
00:21:58,949 --> 00:22:00,416
a pencil into your hand?

411
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,283
Remember it? What do you

412
00:22:03,283 --> 00:22:05,313
think this is, a freckle?

413
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,337
What about the time I hit you

414
00:22:08,337 --> 00:22:10,316
in the face with a pumpkin?

415
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,812
Remember, I stuck a broom

416
00:22:11,812 --> 00:22:15,283
in your spokes and you hit your head on a curb?

418
00:22:15,283 --> 00:22:17,234
No.

419
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,765
But I remember

420
00:22:18,765 --> 00:22:20,261
people telling me about it.

421
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,291
I hope Ben has a little sister.

422
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,242
Yeah.

423
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:28,246
And I hope she can kick his ass.

424
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:31,280
I'm gonna get a new Band-Aid.

425
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,350
How about when I cut the legs

426
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,250
off your Malibu Ken?

427
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,446
That was you?

428
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:40,787
They were infected.

429
00:22:40,787 --> 00:22:42,283
He wouldn't have made it.

430
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,457
My little nephew.

431
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,397
Come here, little one!

432
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:54,271
There's my little baby Ben!

433
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,500
Hey, my little boy.

434
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,402
Hey, he's not crying!

435
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:07,216
Hey, he's not crying!

436
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:11,347
Yes!

437
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,516
There's still pie!

438
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:18,260
I'm here. I'm here.

439
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:20,454
How's my little boy?

440
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,398
You want Daddy to change

441
00:23:23,398 --> 00:23:25,463
your diaper? I know, I know.

442
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:28,351
Did you have fun with Uncle Joey

443
00:23:28,351 --> 00:23:30,364
and Uncle Chandler today?

444
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:33,467
Yeah. He rode the bus today.

445
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:40,284
Big boy riding the bus--

446
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,481
Hey, I have a question.

447
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,386
How come it says ''Property

448
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:49,382
of Human Services'' on his butt?

449
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,457
You....

450
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,560
You are gonna love this.

451
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,459
Can you hold Ben for a sec?

452
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,238
Come here.

453
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,273
Stay back! I've got kiwi!

454
00:24:02,273 --> 00:24:04,241
Run, Joey, run!

455
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:12,316
Smelly cat, smelly cat

456
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:15,250
What are they feeding you?

457
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,269
No, no. I'm sorry, it's:

458
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:20,317
Smelly cat, smelly cat

459
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:28,331
Smelly cat, smelly cat

460
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:29,400
Better!

461
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,367
Yeah?

462
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,335
Much better. Good.

463
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,951
Don't feel bad

464
00:24:33,951 --> 00:24:35,532
because it's a hard song.

465
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:37,858
You want to try it again?

466
00:24:37,858 --> 00:24:39,342
From the top?

467
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:42,242
There is no ''top,'' all right?

468
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:45,248
That's the beauty of ''Smelly Cat.''

469
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,970
Why don't you just follow me?

470
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,454
Okay.

471
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:54,391
Smelly cat, smelly cat

472
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:57,394
What are they feeding you?

473
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:01,288
Smelly cat, smelly cat

474
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:05,201
It's not your fault

475
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:08,238
That's too much. Sorry.
