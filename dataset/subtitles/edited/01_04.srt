1
00:00:03,154 --> 00:00:04,348
All right, Phoebe?

2
00:00:04,455 --> 00:00:06,872
If I were omnipotent for a day,

3
00:00:06,872 --> 00:00:10,856
I would want world peace no hunger, good things

4
00:00:10,856 --> 00:00:12,352
for the rain forest.

5
00:00:13,364 --> 00:00:15,161
And bigger boobs.

6
00:00:16,301 --> 00:00:19,270
Well, see, you took mine.

7
00:00:20,204 --> 00:00:21,193
What about you?

8
00:00:21,306 --> 00:00:23,786
If I were omnipotent for a day,

9
00:00:23,786 --> 00:00:26,266
I'd make myself omnipotent forever.

10
00:00:26,377 --> 00:00:28,874
There's always one guy. ''If I had a

11
00:00:28,874 --> 00:00:31,371
wish, I'd wish for three more wishes.''

12
00:00:33,318 --> 00:00:34,410
Hey, Joey.

13
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,351
What would you do

14
00:00:36,351 --> 00:00:37,483
if you were omnipotent?

15
00:00:38,222 --> 00:00:40,213
Probably kill myself.

16
00:00:41,326 --> 00:00:42,384
Excuse me?

17
00:00:42,427 --> 00:00:44,378
If little Joey's dead,

18
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,329
then I got no reason to live.

19
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:51,427
Joey, omnipotent.

20
00:00:52,337 --> 00:00:54,305
You are?

21
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:57,340
Ross, I'm sorry. I had no idea. I

22
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,275
thought it was a theoretical question.

23
00:01:50,395 --> 00:01:52,329
How does she do that?

24
00:01:52,397 --> 00:01:55,195
I can't sleep in a public place.

25
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:56,362
Libraries, airplanes,

26
00:01:56,362 --> 00:01:57,425
movie theaters....

27
00:01:58,236 --> 00:02:00,170
You slept at the Grand Canyon.

28
00:02:00,238 --> 00:02:02,234
Hello, Mom and Dad never took us

29
00:02:02,234 --> 00:02:04,230
to the Grand Canyon.

30
00:02:05,243 --> 00:02:06,306
Mom and Dad took us

31
00:02:06,306 --> 00:02:07,369
to the Grand Canyon?

32
00:02:09,147 --> 00:02:10,694
Would you look at her?

33
00:02:10,694 --> 00:02:12,241
She is so peaceful.

34
00:02:12,316 --> 00:02:13,374
Yeah.

35
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:16,286
What? What? What?

36
00:02:16,354 --> 00:02:18,367
Hi.

37
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:20,380
It's okay. You just nodded off again.

38
00:02:21,192 --> 00:02:22,181
What's going on?

39
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,757
I got no sleep last night. My

40
00:02:24,757 --> 00:02:30,679
grandmother has a new boyfriend and they're both kind of insecure

41
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:33,159
in bed, so-- And deaf.

42
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:36,356
They reassure each other

43
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:38,307
that they're having a good time.

44
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:42,210
You have no idea how loud they are.

45
00:02:43,181 --> 00:02:44,728
You can stay with Rachel and me.

46
00:02:44,728 --> 00:02:46,275
Thanks.

47
00:02:46,384 --> 00:02:49,376
--95, 96, 97. See, I told you.

48
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:51,337
Less than 100 steps

49
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,486
from our place to here.

50
00:02:53,224 --> 00:02:56,216
You got way too much free time, man.

51
00:02:56,327 --> 00:02:59,194
There's the birthday boy.

52
00:02:59,297 --> 00:03:01,327
Hockey tickets. Rangers-Penguins

53
00:03:01,327 --> 00:03:03,357
tonight and we're taking you.

54
00:03:04,135 --> 00:03:05,648
Happy birthday, pal!

55
00:03:05,648 --> 00:03:07,161
We love you, man.

56
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,786
It's funny. My birthday

57
00:03:09,786 --> 00:03:11,333
was seven months ago.

58
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,808
So?

59
00:03:12,808 --> 00:03:15,892
So you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide

60
00:03:15,892 --> 00:03:17,439
who got to bring a date?

61
00:03:18,182 --> 00:03:19,780
Well, aren't we

62
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,378
Mr. The-Glass-ls-Half-Empty?

63
00:03:22,153 --> 00:03:24,149
Oh, my God! Is today the 20th?

64
00:03:24,149 --> 00:03:26,145
October 20th?

65
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,220
I hoped you wouldn't remember.

66
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,250
What's wrong with the 20th?

67
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:32,728
Eleven days before Halloween.

68
00:03:32,728 --> 00:03:35,162
All the good costumes are gone?

69
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:44,172
Today's the day Carol and I first consummated our physical relationship.

70
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:46,376
Sex.

71
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,731
You told your sister that?

72
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,182
Believe me, I told everyone.

73
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:56,285
I better pass on the game.

74
00:03:56,387 --> 00:03:58,867
I'm just gonna go home and think about

75
00:03:58,867 --> 00:04:01,347
my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.

76
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:03,822
The hell with hockey!

77
00:04:03,822 --> 00:04:05,318
Let's all do that!

78
00:04:07,231 --> 00:04:09,182
Come on, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice!

79
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,133
Guys' night out!

80
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:13,330
Come on, what do you say, big guy?

81
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:14,804
What are you doing?

82
00:04:14,804 --> 00:04:16,237
I have no idea.

83
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,740
Come on, Ross.

84
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,140
Maybe it will take my mind off it.

85
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:22,709
Promise to buy me a big foam finger?

86
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:24,239
You got it.

87
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:27,283
Look, look, look! My first paycheck!

88
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,802
Look at the window!

89
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:32,253
There's my name! Hi, me!

90
00:04:33,157 --> 00:04:34,220
I remember when

91
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,283
I got my first paycheck.

92
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,372
There was a cave-in in a mine,

93
00:04:37,372 --> 00:04:39,385
and eight people were killed.

94
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,298
You worked in a mine?

95
00:04:43,298 --> 00:04:45,397
No, I worked at a Dairy Queen. Why?

96
00:04:48,406 --> 00:04:51,341
Isn't this exciting? I earned this.

97
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:54,276
I wiped tables for it. I steamed milk.

98
00:04:54,312 --> 00:04:59,178
And it was totally not worth it.

99
00:04:59,283 --> 00:05:01,217
What's FICA?

100
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,151
Why's he getting all my money?

101
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:05,685
I mean, what--?

102
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:07,249
Chandler, look at that.

103
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,218
This is not that bad.

104
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:13,230
You're fine, yeah, for a first job.

105
00:05:13,264 --> 00:05:14,714
You can totally,

106
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,164
totally live on this.

107
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:18,327
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

108
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:20,365
By the way, great service today.

109
00:05:20,365 --> 00:05:22,361
Yeah.

110
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:27,307
Hockey!

111
00:05:27,307 --> 00:05:28,370
Hockey!

112
00:05:39,357 --> 00:05:40,756
Hockey!

113
00:05:40,756 --> 00:05:42,155
Hockey.

114
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:45,352
Rachel?

115
00:05:46,364 --> 00:05:49,162
Oh, my God!

116
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:55,787
I swear I've seen birds

117
00:05:55,787 --> 00:05:58,170
do this on Wild Kingdom.

118
00:05:58,209 --> 00:05:59,403
What are you doing here?

119
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:02,743
We were in the city shopping, and your

120
00:06:02,743 --> 00:06:05,342
mom said you work here, and it's true!

121
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:09,785
Look at you in the apron.

122
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:12,219
You look like you're in a play.

123
00:06:14,225 --> 00:06:15,772
God, look at you! You're so big!

124
00:06:15,772 --> 00:06:17,319
I can't believe it!

125
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:21,262
I know, I know! I'm a duplex.

126
00:06:21,365 --> 00:06:24,300
Kiki, you look phenomenal. I mean,

127
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,235
you've lost, like, a ton of weight.

128
00:06:27,338 --> 00:06:31,790
And you should really, really-- It's time to stop,

129
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,439
you look perfect.

130
00:06:34,178 --> 00:06:35,338
What's going on?

131
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:37,409
Well, guess who my dad's

132
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:39,439
making partner in his firm?

133
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:44,303
And while we're on

134
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:45,452
the subject of news....

135
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,355
Look, look! I have elbows!

136
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,267
--Passes it up to Leetch.

137
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,339
Leetch spots Messier. Here's the pass!

138
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:06,173
We'll take a time-out while Messier

139
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:08,238
looks at some women's shoes.

140
00:07:08,312 --> 00:07:10,809
Carol was wearing boots just like

141
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:13,306
those the night that we first....

142
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:16,411
You know? In fact, she....

143
00:07:17,154 --> 00:07:19,213
She never took them off.

144
00:07:19,256 --> 00:07:22,350
It's because we-- Sorry, sorry.

145
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,254
I can't believe--

146
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:28,293
What?

147
00:07:28,293 --> 00:07:29,322
Peach pit.

148
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:32,125
Yes, bunny?

149
00:07:32,336 --> 00:07:36,136
Peach pit. That night, we had--

150
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,236
Peaches?

151
00:07:38,236 --> 00:07:40,232
Actually, nectarines but....

152
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:42,142
Could've been a peach.

153
00:07:42,246 --> 00:07:44,811
Then we-- Then we got dressed

154
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:51,383
and I walked her to the bus stop. I'm fine.

155
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,886
Hey, that woman's got

156
00:07:53,886 --> 00:07:55,382
an ass like Carol's.

157
00:07:59,397 --> 00:08:01,245
What? I thought we were

158
00:08:01,245 --> 00:08:03,093
trying to find stuff.

159
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:04,817
Come on, you guys.

160
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,233
Tell me all the dirt.

161
00:08:06,303 --> 00:08:08,800
Well, the biggest news is still you

162
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,297
dumping Barry at the altar.

163
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,361
Let's talk reality for a second.

164
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:16,312
Okay.

165
00:08:16,347 --> 00:08:18,730
When are you coming home?

166
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,113
What? Guys, I'm not.

167
00:08:21,218 --> 00:08:23,169
Come on. This is us.

168
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,120
I'm not.

169
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:27,152
This is what I'm doing now.

170
00:08:27,152 --> 00:08:29,148
I've got this job.

171
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,320
I even do my own laundry.

172
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:37,863
This is what I'm doing now.

173
00:08:37,863 --> 00:08:39,393
Waitressing?

174
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:43,169
I'm not just waitressing.

175
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:46,167
I mean, I'm....

176
00:08:46,243 --> 00:08:49,212
I write the specials

177
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:52,181
on the specials board.

178
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:54,279
And I take the dead flowers

179
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,275
out of the vase.

180
00:08:56,353 --> 00:08:58,821
Sometimes Arturo lets me put the

181
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:01,289
chocolate blobbies on the cookies.

182
00:09:01,325 --> 00:09:03,708
Well, your mom didn't tell us

183
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,091
about the blobbies.

184
00:09:16,106 --> 00:09:17,602
Hey, Rach.

185
00:09:17,602 --> 00:09:19,098
How was it with your friends?

186
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:23,726
Okay, how would you like

187
00:09:23,726 --> 00:09:25,239
some Tiki Death punch?

188
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:26,732
What's that?

189
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,148
Well, it's rum and--

190
00:09:28,252 --> 00:09:30,152
Okay.

191
00:09:32,122 --> 00:09:33,720
Since Phoebe's staying,

192
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,318
we'll have a slumber party.

193
00:09:35,426 --> 00:09:37,792
We got trashy magazines.

194
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:40,158
We got cookie dough. We got Twister.

195
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:43,696
And I brought Operation. But I lost

196
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:46,261
the tweezers so we can't operate.

197
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:49,331
But we can prep the guy.

198
00:09:51,275 --> 00:09:53,726
Rach, it's the Visa card people.

199
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,177
Oh, God. Ask them what they want.

200
00:09:56,247 --> 00:09:58,198
Could you please tell me

201
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:00,149
what this is in reference to?

202
00:10:00,384 --> 00:10:02,318
There's been unusual

203
00:10:02,318 --> 00:10:04,252
activity on your account.

204
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:06,380
I haven't used my card in weeks.

205
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,352
That is the unusual activity.

206
00:10:10,394 --> 00:10:13,261
They wanna see if you're okay.

207
00:10:13,297 --> 00:10:15,293
They wanna know if I'm okay?

208
00:10:15,293 --> 00:10:17,289
Okay, let's see.

209
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:19,336
Well, let's see.

210
00:10:19,336 --> 00:10:21,304
The FICA guys took all my money.

211
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:23,323
Everyone is getting married

212
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,274
or pregnant or promoted.

213
00:10:25,309 --> 00:10:27,339
And I'm getting coffee.

214
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:29,369
And it's not even for me!

215
00:10:29,413 --> 00:10:31,813
If that sounds like I'm okay,

216
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:34,213
then tell them I'm okay. Okay?

217
00:10:36,186 --> 00:10:38,734
Rachel has left the building.

218
00:10:38,734 --> 00:10:41,282
Can you call back?

219
00:10:41,325 --> 00:10:44,226
All right! Come on!

220
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:47,296
Let's play Twister!

221
00:10:55,306 --> 00:10:57,774
Sorry.

222
00:10:57,774 --> 00:11:00,242
Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

223
00:11:00,277 --> 00:11:02,256
There was ice that night with Carol?

224
00:11:02,256 --> 00:11:04,235
Plastic seats?

225
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:07,273
Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?

226
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:09,816
No, I was just saying

227
00:11:09,816 --> 00:11:11,380
we're not sitting together.

228
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:13,821
But now that you mention it,

229
00:11:13,821 --> 00:11:15,453
there was ice that night.

230
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,252
It was the first frost.

231
00:11:19,296 --> 00:11:21,389
Sit. Just sit down. Sit.

232
00:11:22,166 --> 00:11:23,730
You're doing

233
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,294
this amazing independent thing.

234
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:28,166
Monica, what is so amazing?

235
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:30,285
I gave up, like, everything.

236
00:11:30,285 --> 00:11:32,298
And for what?

237
00:11:32,376 --> 00:11:34,293
You are just like Jack.

238
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,210
Jack from downstairs?

239
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,415
No, Jack and the Beanstalk.

240
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:42,184
Ah, the other Jack.

241
00:11:42,219 --> 00:11:44,301
Right. He gave up something

242
00:11:44,301 --> 00:11:46,383
but then he got those magic beans.

243
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:48,823
And then he woke up

244
00:11:48,823 --> 00:11:52,859
and there was this big plant outside of his window,

245
00:11:52,859 --> 00:11:54,423
full of possibilities.

246
00:11:55,232 --> 00:11:56,779
He lived in a village,

247
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:58,326
and you live in the Village.

248
00:11:58,402 --> 00:12:01,769
Okay. But, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow.

249
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:05,136
I gave up an orthodontist.

250
00:12:05,242 --> 00:12:07,756
Okay, I know I didn't love him....

251
00:12:07,756 --> 00:12:10,270
Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.

252
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:14,140
But, see, it was a plan. It was clear.

253
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:15,718
Everything was figured out.

254
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:17,185
Now it's like....

255
00:12:17,254 --> 00:12:18,249
Floopy?

256
00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:19,244
Yeah.

257
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:24,157
We don't know where we're going.

258
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:26,742
It's all gonna come together

259
00:12:26,742 --> 00:12:29,290
and it's just gonna be un-floopy.

260
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,164
Yeah, like that's a word.

261
00:12:34,371 --> 00:12:36,771
Okay. But Monica, what if

262
00:12:36,771 --> 00:12:39,171
it doesn't come together?

263
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,404
Pheebs?

264
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:44,392
Well, because you just--

265
00:12:44,392 --> 00:12:46,371
I don't like this question.

266
00:12:47,284 --> 00:12:49,235
See, you guys?

267
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,186
What if we don't get magic beans?

268
00:12:51,288 --> 00:12:53,739
I mean, what if all

269
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:56,190
we've got are beans?

270
00:12:59,296 --> 00:13:02,322
Get him! Get him! Get him!

271
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:03,883
Yes! You're not laughing now,

272
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,333
are you, pal?

273
00:13:06,136 --> 00:13:08,132
All you needed were guys

274
00:13:08,132 --> 00:13:10,128
hitting each other with sticks.

275
00:13:10,174 --> 00:13:12,267
Pass it! Pass it!

276
00:13:12,342 --> 00:13:14,793
He's open! He's open!

277
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:17,244
Shoot it! Shoot it!

278
00:13:22,252 --> 00:13:25,153
Hey, look, we're on that TV thing.

279
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:37,292
Excuse me?

280
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:39,767
It says to call if you're not

281
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:42,167
satisfied with this candy bar.

282
00:13:42,206 --> 00:13:45,266
Well, I'm not completely satisfied.

283
00:13:47,211 --> 00:13:48,707
Well, the label

284
00:13:48,707 --> 00:13:50,203
promises nutty goodness.

285
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:53,297
It's an emergency. But you know that,

286
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:55,413
or we'd be in the predicament room.

287
00:13:58,222 --> 00:13:59,718
Hold on. Fill these out.

288
00:13:59,718 --> 00:14:01,214
Sit over there!

289
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:03,321
I don't want to make any trouble

290
00:14:03,321 --> 00:14:05,317
but I'm in a lot of pain.

291
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,795
My face is dented.

292
00:14:07,795 --> 00:14:10,161
Well, you'll have to wait your turn.

293
00:14:10,234 --> 00:14:12,731
How long do you think it will be?

294
00:14:12,731 --> 00:14:15,228
Any minute now.

295
00:14:17,341 --> 00:14:19,332
Hey, this--

296
00:14:31,355 --> 00:14:33,755
I'm so sorry, you guys.

297
00:14:33,755 --> 00:14:36,155
I didn't mean to bring you down.

298
00:14:36,193 --> 00:14:38,741
No, you were right.

299
00:14:38,741 --> 00:14:41,289
I don't have a plan.

300
00:14:43,367 --> 00:14:45,267
Pizza guy.

301
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:47,167
Food!

302
00:14:47,204 --> 00:14:48,233
Phoebe?

303
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:49,262
What?

304
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,336
Do you have a plan?

305
00:14:51,336 --> 00:14:53,366
I don't even have a ''pla.''

306
00:14:56,213 --> 00:14:58,374
One mushroom, green pepper and onion?

307
00:14:59,183 --> 00:15:00,747
No, no, no.

308
00:15:00,747 --> 00:15:02,311
That's not what we ordered!

309
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,769
We ordered a fat-free crust

310
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:06,418
with extra cheese!

311
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,726
Wait. You're not G. Stephanopoulos?

312
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:14,126
Man, my dad's gonna kill me!

313
00:15:14,231 --> 00:15:18,258
Wait! Did you say G. Stephanopoulos?

314
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:20,832
Yeah, this one goes across the street.

315
00:15:20,832 --> 00:15:23,329
I gave him yours. Bonehead! Bonehead!

316
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:25,739
When you do that,

317
00:15:25,739 --> 00:15:27,337
you're only hitting yourself.

318
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:32,359
Was this a small Mediterranean guy

319
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:35,339
with curiously intelligent good looks?

320
00:15:35,385 --> 00:15:37,381
That sounds right.

321
00:15:37,381 --> 00:15:39,377
Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?

322
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,822
And a power tie?

323
00:15:41,822 --> 00:15:43,454
No, pretty much just a towel.

324
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,190
Oh, God!

325
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:48,186
You guys want me to take this back?

326
00:15:48,298 --> 00:15:50,749
What, are you nuts? We've got

327
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,200
George Stephanopoulos' pizza!

328
00:15:56,406 --> 00:16:01,207
Pheebs, who's George Snuffleupagus?

329
00:16:03,146 --> 00:16:05,307
That's Big Bird's friend.

330
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:08,798
I see pizza!

331
00:16:08,798 --> 00:16:10,345
I want to see. Let me see.

332
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:13,112
Hello! Who are we spying on?

333
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,719
White House adviser,

334
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:16,215
Clinton's campaign guy.

335
00:16:16,326 --> 00:16:18,226
The one with the great hair,

336
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:20,126
sexy smile, cute butt.

337
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,198
Oh, him! The little guy.

338
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:24,166
Oh, I love him!

339
00:16:24,268 --> 00:16:26,850
Wait. Wait, I see a woman.

340
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,432
Tell me it's his mother.

341
00:16:30,173 --> 00:16:31,270
Definitely not his mother.

342
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,367
Oh, no!

343
00:16:33,143 --> 00:16:35,242
Wait, she's walking across the floor.

344
00:16:35,242 --> 00:16:37,341
She's walking, she's walking....

345
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:39,360
She's going for the pizza--

346
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,339
That's not for you, bitch!

347
00:16:56,366 --> 00:16:58,800
We've been here for over an hour,

348
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,234
and people less sick have gone in.

349
00:17:01,338 --> 00:17:03,272
That guy with the toe thing,

350
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,206
who's he sleeping with?

351
00:17:08,145 --> 00:17:11,114
Oh, come on, Dora. Don't be mad.

352
00:17:11,181 --> 00:17:17,217
I know we both said some things...we didn't mean but that doesn't

353
00:17:17,217 --> 00:17:19,316
mean we still don't love each other.

354
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:23,251
You know, I feel like I've lost her.

355
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,125
Come on, push me.

356
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,120
No.

357
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:30,279
Push me.

358
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,359
We're gonna get in trouble.

359
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,228
Don't be a baby. Push me. Push me.

360
00:17:34,338 --> 00:17:37,239
All right. I'm gonna push you, okay?

361
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:40,140
How about I push you like this?

362
00:17:41,378 --> 00:17:44,358
Now you're gonna be in a wheelchair

363
00:17:44,358 --> 00:17:47,338
the rest of your life, pally-wally....

364
00:17:49,286 --> 00:17:55,156
I am so very sorry. Can I sign you?

365
00:17:57,294 --> 00:17:58,278
Lights still out?

366
00:17:58,278 --> 00:17:59,262
Yeah.

367
00:17:59,363 --> 00:18:02,230
Well, maybe they're napping.

368
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:04,716
Please. They're having sex.

369
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:07,133
Shut up!

370
00:18:10,107 --> 00:18:14,305
So, what do you think George is like?

371
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:15,743
I think he's shy.

372
00:18:15,743 --> 00:18:17,142
Yeah.

373
00:18:17,214 --> 00:18:18,710
Yeah. I think you have

374
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:20,206
to draw him out.

375
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,747
And then when you do,

376
00:18:22,747 --> 00:18:25,244
he's a preppy animal.

377
00:18:26,256 --> 00:18:27,740
What do you think of the guys?

378
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,224
Our guys?

379
00:18:29,326 --> 00:18:31,226
Yeah, our guys.

380
00:18:31,226 --> 00:18:33,126
I feel funny talking about that.

381
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,743
Oh, come on.

382
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:36,256
Okay. Well....

383
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,783
I think Joey's like

384
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,233
a little kiddie ride.

385
00:18:39,336 --> 00:18:41,384
You just have to put the quarter in

386
00:18:41,384 --> 00:18:43,432
and it just goes.

387
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:47,238
He might surprise you. One time,

388
00:18:47,238 --> 00:18:52,247
he helped me put on my coat and he was really tender.

389
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:57,150
Come on, baby, come on. Let's go.

390
00:18:57,254 --> 00:18:59,188
Yes!

391
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,641
Chandler's one of those repressed guys

392
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,092
who you'd have to seduce.

393
00:19:05,128 --> 00:19:07,608
I think it's an act. Chandler is

394
00:19:07,608 --> 00:19:10,088
more sophisticated than he seems.

395
00:19:15,205 --> 00:19:16,302
You know who's kind of sexy?

396
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:17,399
Don't.

397
00:19:18,141 --> 00:19:19,722
Ross.

398
00:19:19,722 --> 00:19:21,303
No, guys. Please, he is my brother.

399
00:19:21,344 --> 00:19:23,295
I know exactly what you mean.

400
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,246
He can be really smooth.

401
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,260
Can't you just picture him in bed?

402
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:41,422
I really don't want to.

403
00:19:43,233 --> 00:19:45,167
Come on, laugh. Laugh.

404
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:47,832
I remember the moonlight coming in the

405
00:19:47,832 --> 00:19:52,271
window, and her face had the most incredible glow.

406
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,354
The moon, the glow,

407
00:19:54,354 --> 00:19:56,333
the magical feeling. You did this.

408
00:19:57,147 --> 00:19:58,694
Could I get some painkillers

409
00:19:58,694 --> 00:20:00,241
over here, please?

410
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,318
He's right. Enough.

411
00:20:02,318 --> 00:20:04,286
What's the big deal about today?

412
00:20:04,354 --> 00:20:05,821
So you slept with her

413
00:20:05,821 --> 00:20:07,288
for the first time.

414
00:20:07,357 --> 00:20:08,870
You slept with her

415
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,383
for seven years after that.

416
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,387
It's a little more complicated--

417
00:20:14,197 --> 00:20:16,296
What is it, that she left you

418
00:20:16,296 --> 00:20:18,395
for another woman that likes women?

419
00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:21,734
Louder. There's a man on the 1 2th

420
00:20:21,734 --> 00:20:24,299
floor in a coma who didn't hear you.

421
00:20:27,177 --> 00:20:28,201
Then, what?

422
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:34,376
My first time with Carol was was my....

423
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:36,409
What?

424
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:44,283
It was my first time.

425
00:20:44,427 --> 00:20:46,395
With Carol?

426
00:20:51,301 --> 00:20:52,393
Oh.

427
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:55,270
So, in your whole life,

428
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,204
you've only been with one--?

429
00:20:58,408 --> 00:21:02,276
Oh, boy. Hockey was a big mistake.

430
00:21:03,146 --> 00:21:04,710
There's a bunch of stuff

431
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:06,274
we could've done tonight.

432
00:21:08,185 --> 00:21:10,244
Okay, I got one.

433
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:11,866
Do you remember

434
00:21:11,866 --> 00:21:17,149
that vegetarian pâté that I made that you loved so much?

435
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:21,392
Well, unless goose is a vegetable--!

436
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,380
Now I don't feel so bad

437
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,393
about sleeping with Jason Hurley.

438
00:21:29,206 --> 00:21:31,185
What? You slept with Jason?

439
00:21:31,185 --> 00:21:33,164
You had already broken up.

440
00:21:33,276 --> 00:21:34,322
How long?

441
00:21:34,322 --> 00:21:35,368
Just a couple hours.

442
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:38,278
Oh, that's nice!

443
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:40,377
Okay, okay, okay, I got one!

444
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:44,882
Anyway, the valentine Tom left in

445
00:21:44,882 --> 00:21:47,379
your locker was really from me!

446
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:50,225
Excuse me?

447
00:21:50,293 --> 00:21:52,358
Hello! Like he was really

448
00:21:52,358 --> 00:21:54,423
gonna send you one.

449
00:21:56,199 --> 00:21:59,293
She was a big girl!

450
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:03,168
Really? Well, at least big girls don't

451
00:22:03,168 --> 00:22:06,166
pee in their pants in seventh grade!

452
00:22:06,276 --> 00:22:09,245
I was laughing. You made me laugh!

453
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,146
Oh, my God! There he is! There he is!

454
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:13,796
Where?

455
00:22:13,796 --> 00:22:15,343
Where we've been looking all night.

456
00:22:16,152 --> 00:22:17,648
He's so cute.

457
00:22:17,648 --> 00:22:19,144
George, baby, drop the towel.

458
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:21,304
Come on, drop the towel.

459
00:22:21,304 --> 00:22:23,352
Drop it. Will you please drop it?

460
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:26,156
Wow!

461
00:22:28,398 --> 00:22:30,895
Man, can you believe

462
00:22:30,895 --> 00:22:33,392
he's only had sex with one woman?

463
00:22:34,371 --> 00:22:36,367
I think it's great.

464
00:22:36,367 --> 00:22:38,363
You know, it's sweet.

465
00:22:38,475 --> 00:22:40,466
It's romantic.

466
00:22:41,378 --> 00:22:42,402
Really?

467
00:22:43,179 --> 00:22:44,726
You kidding? The guy's a freak.

468
00:22:44,726 --> 00:22:46,273
I judge him.

469
00:22:46,316 --> 00:22:47,300
Hey, man!

470
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,284
Hey, buddy!

471
00:22:52,222 --> 00:22:56,215
Oh, that's attractive.

472
00:22:57,327 --> 00:22:59,227
I thought you were great

473
00:22:59,227 --> 00:23:01,127
in Silence of the Lambs.

474
00:23:02,365 --> 00:23:04,299
Admit it, all things considered,

475
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,233
you had fun tonight.

476
00:23:06,336 --> 00:23:08,253
Fun? Where was the fun?

477
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,170
Tell me which part was fun.

478
00:23:10,273 --> 00:23:11,365
Where's my puck?

479
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:13,638
The kid has it.

480
00:23:13,638 --> 00:23:15,134
The kid--

481
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:18,341
Excuse me, that's my puck.

482
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:21,197
I found it.

483
00:23:21,197 --> 00:23:23,245
Finders keepers, losers weepers.

484
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:27,453
You gotta do it, man.

485
00:23:28,458 --> 00:23:29,925
I'm rubber, you're glue.

486
00:23:29,925 --> 00:23:31,392
Whatever you--

487
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:33,390
I can't do it.

488
00:23:34,197 --> 00:23:35,294
Listen, give me back my puck.

489
00:23:35,294 --> 00:23:36,391
No.

490
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:37,764
Yes, how about--?

491
00:23:37,764 --> 00:23:38,361
No.

492
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:39,385
Give me my puck.

493
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:40,369
No.

494
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:42,371
No roughhousing in my ER!

495
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:45,300
Give me my puck!

496
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,375
Now that was fun.

497
00:23:58,221 --> 00:24:02,317
Okay, Monica. Right foot, red.

498
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:06,318
We could've played Monopoly, but no!

499
00:24:12,268 --> 00:24:14,168
Thanks.

500
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:24,177
Okay, Pheebs. Right hand, blue.

501
00:24:31,187 --> 00:24:33,183
Ross, switch with me

502
00:24:33,183 --> 00:24:35,179
and Phoebe could be number two.

503
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:38,873
Nothing. It's a Twister thing.

504
00:24:38,873 --> 00:24:41,353
The rules are on the back of the box.

505
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,394
Hello?

506
00:24:46,202 --> 00:24:48,170
It's the Visa card people.

507
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:50,239
Okay. Will you take my place?

508
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,207
All right. This is Rachel.

509
00:24:52,308 --> 00:24:54,208
No!

510
00:24:56,279 --> 00:24:58,793
Hello? Oh, yeah. No, I know.

511
00:24:58,793 --> 00:25:01,307
I haven't been using it much.

512
00:25:01,351 --> 00:25:03,234
Oh, well, thanks.

513
00:25:03,234 --> 00:25:05,117
But I'm okay, really.

514
00:25:05,221 --> 00:25:06,267
To the green.

515
00:25:06,267 --> 00:25:07,313
Oh, no.

516
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:10,325
I've got magic beans.

517
00:25:12,362 --> 00:25:14,262
No, no, never mind.

518
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:17,231
To the left! To the left!

519
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:20,325
I'm fine.
