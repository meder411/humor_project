1
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:10,242
Hey, Eddie.

2
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,408
What are you doing here?

3
00:00:13,408 --> 00:00:15,438
Watching you sleep.

4
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:17,461
Why?

5
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:19,440
It makes me feel peaceful.

6
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:21,351
Please.

7
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:22,838
I can't sleep now!

8
00:00:22,838 --> 00:00:24,288
You want me to sing?

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,807
That's it. I want you

10
00:00:28,807 --> 00:00:30,354
out of the apartment now!

11
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,388
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,490
Hannibal Lecter.

13
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,493
Better roommate than you.

14
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,339
You're not fair! One night

15
00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:42,307
you see me and you get scared.

16
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,922
What about the other nights

17
00:00:43,922 --> 00:00:45,469
when you don't see me?

18
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,876
Last night when you got water, I was

19
00:00:48,876 --> 00:00:51,373
nice enough to hide behind the door.

20
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,512
I didn't realize that.

21
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,479
Get out now!

22
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:58,974
You really want me out?

23
00:00:58,974 --> 00:01:00,424
Yes, please.

24
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:02,324
I wanna hear you say

25
00:01:02,324 --> 00:01:03,421
you want me out.

26
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,346
I want you out.

27
00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:07,229
I wanna hear it from your lips.

28
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:11,235
Where did you hear it from before?

29
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:13,319
All right. Consider me gone.

30
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:15,367
I'll move into my brother's basement.

31
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:17,359
When he finds out,

32
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:19,276
I'll go find someplace else.

33
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:21,358
I'll be out by the time

34
00:01:21,358 --> 00:01:23,371
you get home from work tomorrow.

35
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:25,381
-Thank you.

36
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:26,478
I heard that.

37
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,431
Hey.

38
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:18,426
Hey.

39
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,433
Well, look at you!

40
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,737
Finally got that

41
00:02:22,737 --> 00:02:24,233
time machine working, huh?

42
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:26,340
This guy was selling them

43
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,336
on 8th Avenue and I thought:

44
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:29,865
''You know what I don't have?''

45
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:31,349
A mirror?

46
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,835
Fine, make fun.

47
00:02:33,835 --> 00:02:35,285
I think it's jaunty.

48
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,323
For a guy who just lost his job,

49
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:40,257
you're in a good mood.

50
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,907
I'll be all right.

51
00:02:41,907 --> 00:02:43,454
I'm not starting from square one.

52
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,492
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray

53
00:02:45,492 --> 00:02:47,488
on Days of our Lives.

54
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:51,361
That's gotta have some kind of cachet.

55
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,372
''Cachet''? ''Jaunty''?

56
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:55,390
Chandler gave me

57
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,307
word-of-the-day toilet paper.

58
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,312
I'm gonna get some coffee.

59
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,310
Go on. You know you want to.

60
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,320
No.

61
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,315
No?

62
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:15,841
Hey.

63
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:16,421
Hey.

64
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,424
So? Did you read the book?

65
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:20,244
Oh, my God.

66
00:03:20,244 --> 00:03:21,256
It was incredible.

67
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,427
Didn't it totally speak to you?

68
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,334
What book?

69
00:03:25,334 --> 00:03:26,431
You have to read this book.

70
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,441
It's called Be Your Own Wind Keeper.

71
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,790
It's about how women need

72
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,337
to become more empowered.

73
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,472
But there's wind.

74
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,351
And the wind can make us goddesses.

75
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,381
But do you know who takes our wind?

76
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:43,377
Men. They just take it.

77
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,452
Men just take our wind?

78
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,311
All the time. Because they

79
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:51,262
are the lightning-bearers.

80
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,365
Wow.

81
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,847
That sounds kind of cool.

82
00:03:55,847 --> 00:03:57,394
It's like The Hobbit.

83
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,234
It's nothing like The Hobbit.

84
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,319
It's like reading about all my

85
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,332
relationships. Except Richard.

86
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,378
Richard would never steal your wind.

87
00:04:06,378 --> 00:04:08,312
No.

88
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,781
Because he's yummy.

89
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:11,214
Yes.

90
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,217
But all the other ones....

91
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,332
And how they're always drinking

92
00:04:15,332 --> 00:04:17,345
from our pool of inner power.

93
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,840
But God forbid we should take a sip.

94
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,257
Anybody want a cruller?

95
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,858
This is a typical

96
00:04:23,858 --> 00:04:25,354
lightning-bearer thing.

97
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,899
It's like, ''Hello. Who wants one

98
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:30,367
of my phallic-shaped man-cakes?''

99
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,269
Who have you been dating?

100
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,948
Don't worry about it.

101
00:04:47,948 --> 00:04:49,444
Things happen.

102
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,486
So you're not mad at me

103
00:04:52,486 --> 00:04:54,482
for getting fired and everything?

104
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,286
Joey, look at me.

105
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,294
Look at me!

106
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,203
Do I have lipstick on my teeth?

107
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,430
No. Can we get back to me?

108
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,290
Look, honey. People get fired

109
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,338
left and right in this business.

110
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,863
I got you an audition

111
00:05:14,863 --> 00:05:16,313
for Another World.

112
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:19,207
All right.

113
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,412
''Cab Driver Number 2''?

114
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,413
You're welcome.

115
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,424
But I was Dr. Drake Ramoray.

116
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:28,790
How can I go from

117
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,354
a neurosurgeon to driving a cab?

118
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:33,364
Hey. There was a time when I played

119
00:05:33,364 --> 00:05:36,265
tickle-pickle with Rex Harrison.

120
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,331
Things change. Roll with them.

121
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,432
But this is a two-line part.

122
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:46,740
It's like taking a step backwards.

123
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,237
I'm not gonna do this.

124
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:54,364
Joey I'll tell you the same thing I told

126
00:05:54,364 --> 00:05:57,344
AI Minser and his pyramid of dogs.

127
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,339
Take any job you can get

128
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:02,387
and don't make on the floor.

129
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,388
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,422
See you.

131
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,393
God!

132
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,232
Oh, God!

133
00:06:12,232 --> 00:06:13,227
I mean, it's just so....

134
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,204
Isn't it?

135
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:18,206
It's like reading about my own life.

136
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,359
This book could have been called,

137
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:22,407
''Be Your Own Wind Keeper, Rachel.''

138
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,332
It wouldn't sell a million copies. But

139
00:06:25,332 --> 00:06:27,448
it would've made a nice gift for you.

140
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:28,867
Hey, you guys.

141
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:29,413
Hey.

142
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,520
Sweetie, we've got to go.

143
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,247
No!

144
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,350
No?

145
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,897
Why do we always have to do everything

146
00:06:38,897 --> 00:06:41,365
according to your timetable?

147
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,402
Actually, it's the movie theater

148
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:45,370
that has the timetable.

149
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,338
It's so you don't miss the beginning.

150
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,810
This isn't about the movie theater.

151
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,278
This is about you stealing my wind.

152
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,476
You go, girl!

153
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:04,220
I can't pull that off, can I?

154
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,382
Excuse me, your wind?

155
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,292
Yes, my wind.

156
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,391
How do you expect me to grow

157
00:07:11,391 --> 00:07:13,387
if you won't let me blow?

158
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:27,211
You know I don't...have a problem with that.

160
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,371
I just really need to be

161
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:41,419
with myself right now.

162
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,328
I'm sorry.

163
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,897
You're right.

164
00:07:45,897 --> 00:07:47,364
I don't have to apologize.

165
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,232
Sorry. Damn it!

166
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,392
What is it?

167
00:07:57,392 --> 00:07:58,342
I don't know.

168
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:00,777
It's got all this stuff about wind

169
00:08:00,777 --> 00:08:03,177
and trees and a sacred pool.

170
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,795
I don't get it.

171
00:08:04,795 --> 00:08:06,308
But she's upset about it.

172
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,285
This is why I don't date

173
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:10,185
women who read.

174
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,402
Uh-oh.

175
00:08:12,402 --> 00:08:13,414
What's that?

176
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:16,793
It's my Visa bill.

177
00:08:16,793 --> 00:08:19,193
Envelope one of two.

178
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,316
That can't be good.

179
00:08:22,316 --> 00:08:24,199
Open it, open it.

180
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,304
Oh, my God.

181
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,721
Look at this.

182
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:32,234
How did I spend so much money?

183
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:34,407
That's just the minimum amount due.

184
00:08:34,407 --> 00:08:36,403
That's your total due.

185
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:39,849
Thirty-five hundred dollars

186
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:41,481
at ''Porcelain Safari''?

187
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,314
My animals.

188
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,937
The guy said they suited me. He spoke

189
00:08:46,937 --> 00:08:49,417
with an accent. I was confused.

190
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,321
What am I gonna do?

191
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,926
Start by driving a cab

192
00:08:52,926 --> 00:08:54,422
on Another World.

193
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,417
What?

194
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:56,367
That audition?

195
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,369
That's a two-line part.

196
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:00,439
Joey, you owe $1 100

197
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,407
at ''I Love Lucite.''

198
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,271
So what?

199
00:09:04,271 --> 00:09:05,266
So suck it up, man.

200
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,278
It's a job. It's money.

201
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,747
I don't need you getting judgmental

202
00:09:09,747 --> 00:09:12,181
and condescending and pedantic.

203
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,382
Toilet paper?

204
00:09:13,382 --> 00:09:14,479
Yeah.

205
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,885
I'm not any of those.

206
00:09:17,885 --> 00:09:19,381
I'm being realistic.

207
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:20,909
You're supposed to be my friend.

208
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:22,393
I am.

209
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,793
Then tell me things like,

210
00:09:24,793 --> 00:09:26,391
''You'll be fine.''

211
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,928
''Something big's coming. I know it!''

212
00:09:27,928 --> 00:09:29,424
I don't.

213
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,335
What I do know is you owe $2300

214
00:09:32,335 --> 00:09:34,434
at ''Isn't It Chromantic?''

215
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,208
I'm aware of what I owe.

216
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,261
Then get some sense.

217
00:09:39,261 --> 00:09:41,212
It took 10 years to get that job.

218
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,827
How long till the next?

219
00:09:42,827 --> 00:09:44,340
I don't wanna hear it!

220
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,913
I'm just saying--

221
00:09:45,913 --> 00:09:47,409
Well, don't just say!

222
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,803
Maybe I should just go.

223
00:09:51,803 --> 00:09:53,350
Okay.

224
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,361
Okay. I'll see you later.

225
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,314
Just think about it.

226
00:09:59,314 --> 00:10:01,265
I don't need to think about it!

227
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,382
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray!

228
00:10:03,382 --> 00:10:05,430
That was huge!

229
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,234
Big things are gonna happen!

230
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:10,230
You'll see! Ross?

231
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,436
You still there?

232
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,368
Hey, pal!

233
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,938
What are you still doing here?

234
00:10:40,938 --> 00:10:43,372
Dehydrating fruits and vegetables.

235
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,468
Man alive, this thing's fantastic!

236
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,393
Aren't you forgetting anything?

237
00:10:49,393 --> 00:10:51,406
Right. I got us a new goldfish.

238
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,282
He's feistier than the last one.

239
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,299
Maybe because the last one

240
00:10:56,299 --> 00:10:58,278
was made by Pepperidge Farm.

241
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,308
Isn't there something else

242
00:11:00,308 --> 00:11:02,225
you're supposed to be doing?

243
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,859
Not unless it's got to do

244
00:11:03,859 --> 00:11:09,258
with dehydrating. Right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!

246
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,983
Look, we had a deal.

247
00:11:11,983 --> 00:11:13,530
I thought by the time I got--

248
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,467
You know what that is?

249
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,234
Your last roommate's kidney?

250
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,245
That's a tomato.

251
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,894
This one definitely

252
00:11:22,894 --> 00:11:24,441
goes in the display.

253
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:34,776
Hey, Gunther.

254
00:11:34,776 --> 00:11:36,260
Let me get a lemonade to go.

255
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:39,387
Lemonade? You okay, man?

256
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,414
It's career stuff. They killed off

257
00:11:42,414 --> 00:11:44,462
my character on the show.

258
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,465
That's too bad. How'd they do it?

259
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,474
I fell down an elevator shaft.

260
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:52,773
That sucks.

261
00:11:52,773 --> 00:11:54,269
I was buried in an avalanche.

262
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,448
What?

263
00:11:57,448 --> 00:11:59,382
I was Bryce on All My Children.

264
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,432
Why must everybody watch me sleep?

265
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,376
No more watching me sleep!

266
00:12:25,376 --> 00:12:27,276
No more...watching!

267
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,370
I got new stuff to dehydrate.

268
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,383
I got some grapes and apricots.

269
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,378
I thought it'd be cool

270
00:12:44,378 --> 00:12:46,295
to do water balloons.

271
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:49,390
Get out. Get out, get out, get out!

272
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:51,900
What?

273
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,497
You. Move out!

274
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,268
Take your fruit.

275
00:12:55,268 --> 00:12:57,264
Your stupid small fruit and get out!

276
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,310
You want me to move out?

277
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,288
I gotta tell you,

278
00:13:10,288 --> 00:13:12,222
that's kind of out of the blue.

279
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,922
This is not out of the blue. This is

280
00:13:15,922 --> 00:13:18,419
smack-dab in the middle of the blue!

281
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,223
Relax! Take it easy, buddy!

282
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,235
You don't have to tell me twice.

283
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:28,238
Someone will be by for my stuff.

284
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:34,861
If you think I'm leaving you

285
00:13:34,861 --> 00:13:37,278
alone with my fish, you're insane!

286
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:38,896
You want some help?

287
00:13:38,896 --> 00:13:40,443
No help required, chico!

288
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,251
You don't see that every day.

289
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,399
''All the way to the airport?

290
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:57,299
That's over 30 miles.''

291
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,899
''That's gonna cost you

292
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:00,395
about so bucks.''

293
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,232
Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.

294
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,806
What?

295
00:14:05,806 --> 00:14:07,302
Five-O dollars.

296
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,343
You know what it is?

297
00:14:10,343 --> 00:14:12,339
It's smudgy because they're fax pages.

298
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,335
When I was on Days of our Lives

299
00:14:14,335 --> 00:14:17,902
as Dr. Drake Ramoray they'd send over

301
00:14:17,902 --> 00:14:19,449
the whole script on real paper.

302
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,453
That's great.

303
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,758
If you wanted to expand this scene,

304
00:14:24,758 --> 00:14:29,432
like have the cab crash I could attend to the victims.

306
00:14:29,432 --> 00:14:31,531
I have a background in medical acting.

307
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,250
Thanks for coming in.

308
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,229
Don't thank me for coming in.

309
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,467
At least let me finish.

310
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,372
''We could take the expressway.''

311
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,446
''But this time of day,

312
00:14:46,446 --> 00:14:48,442
you're better off taking the budge.''

313
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,774
You were going for ''bridge,''

314
00:14:52,774 --> 00:14:54,258
weren't you?

315
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,285
I'll have a good day.

316
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:02,366
Honey, I know you didn't mean to.

317
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:04,300
I know, me too.

318
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,320
Hang up. You're supposed to be

319
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,237
taking a goddess quiz.

320
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,858
You should lose 100 points for calling

321
00:15:10,858 --> 00:15:13,309
your boyfriend in the middle of it.

322
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,408
Question 28.

323
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:21,486
''Have you ever allowed

324
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:23,454
a lightning-bearer to take your wind?''

325
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,323
I would have to say no.

326
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,427
And I would have to say:

327
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:32,947
What?

328
00:15:32,947 --> 00:15:34,431
You don't remember the puppet guy?

329
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,963
You totally let him wash his feet

330
00:15:36,963 --> 00:15:39,460
in the pool of your inner power.

331
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,240
And his puppet too!

332
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,457
At least I didn't let a guy into

333
00:15:45,457 --> 00:15:49,474
the forest of my righteous truth on the first date!

335
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:53,798
Who?

336
00:15:53,798 --> 00:15:54,344
Paul!

337
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:55,478
Oh.

338
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,349
Moving on. Next question.

339
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,187
Okay, number 29.

340
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,789
''Have you ever betrayed

341
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:05,814
another goddess for a lightning-bearer?''

343
00:16:05,814 --> 00:16:07,298
Number 30.

344
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,817
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

345
00:16:08,817 --> 00:16:10,301
Let's go back to 29.

346
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,306
Not to my recollection.

347
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:20,342
Danny Arshak, ninth grade. You know

348
00:16:20,342 --> 00:16:22,441
the bottle was pointing at me.

349
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,266
Only because you took up

350
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:27,217
half the circle.

351
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,406
Listen to you two.

352
00:16:31,406 --> 00:16:33,357
It's so sad.

353
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:35,410
Looks like I'll be going

354
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,361
to the goddess meetings alone.

355
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:38,942
Not if they find out you slept

356
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:42,831
with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up

358
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:44,429
with Monica.

359
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,268
Only an hour?

360
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:50,272
You are such a leaf-blower!

361
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:51,907
Pool-drainer.

362
00:16:51,907 --> 00:16:53,272
Twig-snapper.

363
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,368
Monkey butt.

364
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,266
That isn't in the book.

365
00:16:58,266 --> 00:16:59,250
No.

366
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,309
But that's what you are.

367
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,766
Careful with that 3-D Last Supper.

368
00:17:15,766 --> 00:17:18,200
Judas is a little loose.

369
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,432
Oh, my God! What's going on?

370
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,344
They're taking all my stuff back.

371
00:17:27,344 --> 00:17:29,244
You were right.

372
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:31,299
I wasn't right.

373
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:33,250
That's what I came here to tell you.

374
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,336
I was hung up on my own stuff

375
00:17:35,336 --> 00:17:37,253
the other day.

376
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,307
No, listen. I need the whole

377
00:17:39,307 --> 00:17:41,258
security thing, you know?

378
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,374
To know where my next paycheck

379
00:17:43,374 --> 00:17:45,422
is coming from. You don't need that.

380
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,261
That's amazing to me.

381
00:17:48,261 --> 00:17:50,257
I could never do what you do.

382
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,383
Thanks.

383
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,463
Hold out for something bigger.

384
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,787
I have so much respect for you for not

385
00:17:56,787 --> 00:17:59,301
going to that cab driver audition.

386
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,293
I went.

387
00:18:00,293 --> 00:18:01,208
Great! How was it?

388
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,345
I didn't get it.

389
00:18:03,345 --> 00:18:05,210
Good! You're living the dream!

390
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,376
Huh?

391
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,414
All right, then!

392
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,486
Not my parrot.

393
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,291
I can't watch this.

394
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,389
Hey, hold on, hold on.

395
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:20,264
How much for the--?

396
00:18:20,264 --> 00:18:22,198
How much to save the bird?

397
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:22,898
Twelve hundred.

398
00:18:22,898 --> 00:18:23,495
Dollars?

399
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,497
You spent $1 200 on a plastic bird?

400
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,756
It was an impulse buy

401
00:18:28,756 --> 00:18:30,206
near the register.

402
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,207
Go ahead with the bird.

403
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:36,338
Do you have anything for around $200?

404
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,308
The dog.

405
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,412
Yeah.

406
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,414
I'll take it. My gift to you, man.

407
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,319
Thanks, Ross!

408
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,227
I really liked that bird, though.

409
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,232
But the dog!

410
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:05,772
Here are your cakes.

411
00:19:05,772 --> 00:19:07,268
We didn't order cake.

412
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:11,210
No, I know. They're from me.

413
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,750
This isn't good. We have enough

414
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:18,279
trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking each other's.

416
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,220
You're right.

417
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,387
I love you goddesses.

418
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,814
I don't ever want

419
00:19:26,814 --> 00:19:28,298
to suck your wind again.

420
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,264
Thank you. So are we good?

421
00:19:30,264 --> 00:19:31,327
We're good.

422
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:32,368
We're good?

423
00:19:32,368 --> 00:19:33,300
Yes.

424
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,401
Let me take these back.

425
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:37,397
They'll take it out of my paycheck.

426
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,402
Ding-dong, the psycho's gone!

427
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,269
Are you sure this time?

428
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:50,220
Yes. I actually saw him leave.

429
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,836
That guy is standing in the window

430
00:19:52,836 --> 00:19:55,350
holding a human head!

431
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,326
I tore it off some mannequin

432
00:20:00,326 --> 00:20:02,322
in the alley behind Macy's.

433
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,232
There's no alley there.

434
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:05,816
I got in the junior miss department.

435
00:20:05,816 --> 00:20:07,363
Big diff.

436
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,441
It can be at our next cocktail party.

437
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:13,444
''Our next cocktail party''?

438
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,860
We'll put chips in it.

439
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,441
We'll make it a chip chick.

440
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,343
Do you remember yesterday?

441
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:25,548
Yes, I think I vaguely recall it.

442
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:30,990
Do you remember

443
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,486
talking to me yesterday?

444
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,494
Yes.

445
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:40,984
What happened?

446
00:20:40,984 --> 00:20:42,497
We took a road trip to Las Vegas.

447
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,367
Oh, sweet Moses!

448
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,861
On this road trip,

449
00:20:47,861 --> 00:20:49,311
you win any money?

450
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,377
I crapped out. But Mr. 21 here!

451
00:20:51,377 --> 00:20:53,373
He cleans up! $300!

452
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,464
He buys me these new shoes.

453
00:20:54,464 --> 00:20:55,510
Nice.

454
00:20:57,322 --> 00:21:00,257
See you upstairs. See you, pals.

455
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,741
Is anyone else starting

456
00:21:04,741 --> 00:21:06,254
to really like him?

457
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:27,479
May I help you?

458
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,404
Why doesn't my key work,

459
00:21:30,404 --> 00:21:32,355
and why's my stuff downstairs?

460
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,256
I'm sorry.

461
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,352
Have we met?

462
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,928
It's Eddie, you freak!

463
00:21:37,928 --> 00:21:39,395
Your roommate.

464
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:44,358
I'm sorry I already have a roommate.

466
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,460
Hello.

467
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:53,475
He's lived here for years. I don't

468
00:21:53,475 --> 00:21:55,574
know what you're talking about.

469
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:02,248
No. He moved out and I moved in.

470
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,339
Well, I think we'd remember

471
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:07,256
something like that.

472
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,351
I know I would.

473
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,353
That's a good point.

474
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:14,220
Okay, wow.

475
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,235
I guess I got the wrong apartment.

476
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:20,837
I'm terribly sorry.

477
00:22:20,837 --> 00:22:22,236
Hey, no problem.

478
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,330
See you.

479
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:33,474
Goodbye, you fruit-drying psychopath.

480
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,465
You want me to help you unpack?

481
00:22:36,465 --> 00:22:38,444
No, I'm okay.

482
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,469
Just so you know, I'm not

483
00:22:40,469 --> 00:22:42,448
moving back because I have to.

484
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:45,395
I mean, I do have to, but....

485
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:46,993
It's just that that place,

486
00:22:46,993 --> 00:22:48,489
it wasn't really....

487
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:51,360
I mean, this is....

488
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,362
Welcome home, man.

489
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:04,811
A little foos?

490
00:23:04,811 --> 00:23:06,307
Absolutely.

491
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,345
What happened to the foosball?

492
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,252
It's a cantaloupe.

493
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:18,842
Are we bringing this out

494
00:23:18,842 --> 00:23:20,355
every time Ross comes?

495
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:23,367
He paid a lot of money for it.

496
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:31,374
I'm gonna hold him a different way.

497
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,942
If you hated it so much,

498
00:23:33,942 --> 00:23:35,540
why did you buy it?

499
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:37,879
I had a whole ceramic

500
00:23:37,879 --> 00:23:39,477
zoo thing going over there.

501
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:41,382
But without the others,

502
00:23:41,382 --> 00:23:42,479
it looks tacky.

503
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:45,267
Yeah. With things like this,

504
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:47,246
more is always better.

505
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:50,827
Is he housetrained or will he leave

506
00:23:50,827 --> 00:23:53,261
little bathroom tiles all over?

507
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,356
Stay.

508
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,297
Stay!

509
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,462
Good fake dog.
