1
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:03,459
Stocks and bonds are moving higher....

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:05,334
Why are we watching

3
00:00:05,334 --> 00:00:06,431
the Business Channel?

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,339
The other day there was a stock

5
00:00:09,339 --> 00:00:11,438
with my initials, M-E-G, on it.

6
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,958
Sometimes it takes hours to come up

7
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:16,438
again but when it does, it's exciting.

8
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:21,447
Okay, honey, you really need a job.

9
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:23,419
Dad knows someone you can call

10
00:00:23,419 --> 00:00:25,284
for an interview.

11
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,905
Right there!

12
00:00:26,905 --> 00:00:28,452
That's the third sign today.

13
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,447
On behalf of everyone,

14
00:00:31,447 --> 00:00:33,398
I'd just like to say, ''Huh?''

15
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,883
You just said ''Dad.'' Everywhere I go

16
00:00:35,883 --> 00:00:40,868
today I keep getting signs telling me to see my father. When I

17
00:00:40,868 --> 00:00:43,365
was walking over, I passed a ''buffet.''

18
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,471
Which is my father's last name.

19
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:51,414
And they were serving franks,

20
00:00:51,414 --> 00:00:53,513
which is his first name minus the S.

21
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,339
And there was a rotisserie

22
00:00:57,339 --> 00:00:59,290
with a spinning ''chicken.''

23
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,519
His Indian name?

24
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,310
No. Because I ''chickened'' out

25
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:09,301
the last time when I tried to meet him.

26
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:11,269
Coincidences? I don't think so.

27
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,321
Very freaky.

28
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:13,271
Weird. Eerie.

29
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,273
Who wants the last burger?

30
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,434
That's it. I have to go see him.

31
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:19,307
Why?

32
00:01:19,307 --> 00:01:20,336
Hamburger.

33
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,348
McDonald's.

34
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,816
Old McDonald had a ''farm.''

35
00:01:24,816 --> 00:01:27,250
My dad is a pharmacist.

36
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:30,851
And E-I-E-I-O is what your mom said

37
00:01:30,851 --> 00:01:33,348
when your dad left her.

38
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,343
Yes.

39
00:01:34,343 --> 00:01:35,293
Really?

40
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,261
No.

41
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:25,911
Man, I am so beat.

42
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:27,378
Oh, yeah.

43
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,460
Wanna forget racquetball and hang out?

44
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,473
Yeah, all right.

45
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,354
Hey, you're in our seats.

46
00:02:36,354 --> 00:02:38,254
Sorry, we didn't know.

47
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,485
We were sitting there.

48
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:43,294
Okay. There is one more way to say it.

49
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,263
Who knows it?

50
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,883
Was that supposed to be funny?

51
00:02:48,883 --> 00:02:51,300
Actually, I was going for colorful.

52
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,887
What's with this guy?

53
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:54,303
What's with you?

54
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:55,921
Nothing. Nothing's with him.

55
00:02:55,921 --> 00:02:57,468
Enjoy your coffee.

56
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,248
What just happened?

57
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,232
I just took your hat.

58
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:11,211
See, I can be funny too.

59
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,259
My joke is that I took your hat.

60
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:17,228
That is funny.

61
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:18,862
Can I have it back?

62
00:03:18,862 --> 00:03:20,261
No.

63
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:22,781
No?

64
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:23,327
No.

65
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:26,438
Okay. Okay.

66
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,807
You know what?

67
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:30,274
I think you're very funny.

68
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,335
Kudos on that hat joke.

69
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,815
But come on,

70
00:03:36,815 --> 00:03:38,282
just give him back the hat.

71
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,452
Why should we?

72
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,245
Because it's a special hat.

73
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,320
He bought it because he was feeling

74
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,259
down one day. He got the hat to cheer himself up, you know?

75
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,830
Chandler--

76
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,263
Stop talking. Stop talking now.

77
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,303
You're stealing my hat?

78
00:03:58,303 --> 00:04:00,237
You got a problem with that?

79
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,870
No, just want to make sure

80
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,434
we're on the same page.

81
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,296
Rach, I've gone dad-hunting

82
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,247
with Phoebe before.

83
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,463
This is a very scary thing for her.

84
00:04:11,463 --> 00:04:16,302
She gets real vulnerable and that's why we're there,

85
00:04:16,302 --> 00:04:18,350
to be supportive and crap.

86
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,738
Okay. You just let me know

87
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:22,251
when to do which.

88
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,362
How did the interview go?

89
00:04:26,362 --> 00:04:27,459
It bit.

90
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,326
It was a '50s theme restaurant.

91
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,388
I'd have to cook in a costume

92
00:04:33,388 --> 00:04:35,339
and dance on the counter.

93
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,808
I was a sous chef

94
00:04:36,808 --> 00:04:38,241
at CafÃ© des Artistes.

95
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,274
How can I take a job where I

96
00:04:40,274 --> 00:04:42,270
make Laverne-and-Curly fries?

97
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:43,394
So, don't do it.

98
00:04:43,394 --> 00:04:44,440
How can I not?

99
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,452
I have $1 27 in the bank!

100
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,920
Monica, relax. Go get a beer.

101
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,354
I don't want a beer.

102
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,484
Who said it was for you?

103
00:04:58,564 --> 00:04:59,878
Hi.

104
00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:01,192
Hi.

105
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,202
What's the matter with you?

106
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,799
Some mean guys at the coffeehouse

107
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:06,295
took my hat.

108
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,356
No!

109
00:05:07,356 --> 00:05:08,306
You're kidding!

110
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,859
It was ridiculous. These guys

111
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:13,310
were bullies. Actual bullies.

112
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,364
We're grownups. This isn't

113
00:05:15,364 --> 00:05:17,315
supposed to happen anymore.

114
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,816
Oh, no, wait a minute.

115
00:05:21,816 --> 00:05:23,312
I have no one.

116
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:27,876
Let's go down there

117
00:05:27,876 --> 00:05:29,326
and get your hat back.

118
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,796
Forget it. It's probably stripped

119
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:34,230
and sold for parts by now.

120
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:36,866
I went up!

121
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:37,463
What?

122
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:39,784
My stock, MEG,

123
00:05:39,784 --> 00:05:41,331
it went up two points.

124
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,404
Do you realize if I'd invested

125
00:05:43,404 --> 00:05:47,496
my $1 27 in myself yesterday that I'd, like, have

126
00:05:47,496 --> 00:05:49,447
a lot more than that today.

127
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,966
You know what?

128
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:53,382
I'm going to do it.

129
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,465
Do what?

130
00:05:54,465 --> 00:05:55,477
Put all my money in me.

131
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,404
You don't know a thing

132
00:05:57,404 --> 00:05:58,553
about the stock market.

133
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:01,789
What's to know? Buy, sell. High, low.

134
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:04,286
Bears, bulls. Yes, Manhattan.

135
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,201
Telephone number to the stock selling store.

136
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:20,829
I told you these pillows

137
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:22,313
were a good idea.

138
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,410
Oh, God.

139
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,209
Here we go.

140
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,316
For the first time in my life,

141
00:06:29,316 --> 00:06:31,312
I'll say, ''Hi, birth Father!''

142
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,807
Love you. We're here for you.

143
00:06:32,807 --> 00:06:34,257
Good luck.

144
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,453
Thanks.

145
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,479
Hey, Rach, you want some sandwich?

146
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,527
What is in that?

147
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,817
Olive loaf and ham spread. No mayo.

148
00:06:45,817 --> 00:06:48,365
No, because mayo would make it gross.

149
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,828
Run, Phoebe, run!

150
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:55,278
No, doggy, please!

151
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,946
I do so want to love all animals.

152
00:06:56,946 --> 00:06:58,544
Please, no.

153
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,280
You got a bone?

154
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,275
Are you kidding?

155
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,379
Look, kibbles! Bits!

156
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,854
Get the hell off my leg,

157
00:07:05,854 --> 00:07:07,418
you yippity piece of crap!

158
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,301
Okay. All right. We have a problem.

159
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,700
Why don't you reach out

160
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,196
and take his trampoline?

161
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,724
Here, I know what we can do.

162
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:24,208
Hey! No!

163
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:28,404
Okay, doggy, get the sandwich!

164
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,779
Go get the sandwich!

165
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:32,343
Good doggy. Get the sandwich!

166
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,834
The dog will lick himself

167
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:36,449
but won't touch your sandwich.

168
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,214
What does that tell you?

169
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:40,824
I'll eat it then.

170
00:07:40,824 --> 00:07:42,223
Are you crazy?

171
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,229
He's just a little dog.

172
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,288
Hey.

173
00:07:53,288 --> 00:07:54,238
What?

174
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,309
Do you have to be a Century 21 real

175
00:07:57,309 --> 00:08:00,278
estate agent to wear the cool jackets?

176
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,406
Do you say this stuff to girls?

177
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:08,699
Hey, isn't that the guy

178
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:10,212
who used to wear your hat?

179
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,190
And look where they're sitting.

180
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,276
You're joking, right?

181
00:08:17,276 --> 00:08:19,324
You guys just walked through the door.

182
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,865
Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.

183
00:08:20,865 --> 00:08:22,298
Yeah.

184
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,496
This couch belongs to us.

185
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:26,851
I'll tell you what,

186
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:35,346
you call the couch and then we'll call the couch...and we'll see who it comes to.

187
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,368
Know what I don't like about you?

188
00:08:40,368 --> 00:08:42,319
You always got something to say.

189
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,412
Well, that--

190
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,842
You know what I keep wondering?

191
00:08:48,842 --> 00:08:51,259
Why you two are still sitting here.

192
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,321
All right, that's it.

193
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,349
I have had enough of this, all right.

194
00:08:55,349 --> 00:08:57,232
Gunther.

195
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,838
These guys are trying

196
00:08:59,838 --> 00:09:01,305
to take our seat.

197
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,300
Fellas, these guys were here first.

198
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,372
Oh, sorry.

199
00:09:05,372 --> 00:09:06,367
Didn't realize.

200
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,777
There you go.

201
00:09:08,777 --> 00:09:10,375
Thank you, Gunther.

202
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,752
We didn't want to have

203
00:09:14,752 --> 00:09:16,185
to go and do that.

204
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,313
He told on us?

205
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,283
You told on us?

206
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,277
Well, pal, you didn't

207
00:09:22,277 --> 00:09:24,228
give me much of a choice.

208
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,748
Don't play with his thing.

209
00:09:26,748 --> 00:09:28,198
I know.

210
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,396
All right.

211
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,304
Let's take this outside.

212
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,234
''Let's take this outside''?

213
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,439
Who talks like that?

214
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,298
The guy who's about to kick your ass

215
00:09:46,298 --> 00:09:48,346
talks like that.

216
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,871
You had to ask.

217
00:09:49,871 --> 00:09:51,321
Yeah.

218
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:58,425
Okay. Okay, look. See the thing is, we're not gonna

219
00:09:58,425 --> 00:10:00,421
fight you guys.

220
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,264
Then here's the deal:

221
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,804
You won't have to, so long as you

222
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:08,272
never show your faces here again.

223
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,909
I think you played

224
00:10:14,909 --> 00:10:16,439
the Gunther card too soon.

225
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:23,921
Hey, Pheebs, I think you're

226
00:10:23,921 --> 00:10:25,354
good to go.

227
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,482
Yeah. I don't know.

228
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,309
What's the matter?

229
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:33,357
I think this was a really bad sign.

230
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,883
Like the beast at the threshold,

231
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:36,367
you know.

232
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,262
It's just I have no family left.

233
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,787
Except for my grandmother.

234
00:10:43,787 --> 00:10:46,267
But she's not gonna be around forever.

235
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,472
Despite what she says.

236
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,879
And I have a sister who I've barely

237
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:54,376
spoken to since we shared a womb.

238
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:58,306
I don't know. This is my real father

239
00:10:58,306 --> 00:11:01,224
and I want things to be just right.

240
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,823
I completely understand.

241
00:11:02,823 --> 00:11:04,319
Whatever you need.

242
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,431
Hey, you wanna go home?

243
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,258
Okay, thanks. Sorry again.

244
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,446
What was that?

245
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:39,262
I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.

246
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,267
I wanna buy five shares of SGJ, now.

247
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,465
Come on, time is money, my friend!

248
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,503
Thank you!

249
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,506
''Time is money, my friend''?

250
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,377
You missed

251
00:11:55,377 --> 00:11:58,466
''Takes money to make money,'' and ''Don't make me come down

252
00:11:58,466 --> 00:12:00,417
and kick your Wall Street butt.''

253
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,767
I made $1 7 before breakfast.

254
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:04,314
What have you done?

255
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,307
I had breakfast here,

256
00:12:06,307 --> 00:12:08,258
so technically I saved $3.50.

257
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,225
How did you make $1 7?

258
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,298
Well, my financially challenged

259
00:12:13,298 --> 00:12:17,461
friends, I split my money and bought shares of CHP and ZXY.

260
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,328
How come those?

261
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,889
Well, CHP because I used to have a

262
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:24,340
crush on Erik Estrada.

263
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,307
And ZXY because I think

264
00:12:27,307 --> 00:12:29,337
it sounds ''zexy.''

265
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,372
What happened to MEG?

266
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,351
MEG was good for me, but I dumped her.

267
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,353
My motto is, ''Get out

268
00:12:36,353 --> 00:12:38,253
before they go down.''

269
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,250
That is so not my motto.

270
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:47,330
Hey.

271
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,262
Hey, Pheebs.

272
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:48,880
How's the dog?

273
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,460
Yeah.

274
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,453
I talked to the vet.

275
00:12:51,453 --> 00:12:53,404
People are so nice upstate.

276
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,373
He said the little fella's gonna be

277
00:12:56,373 --> 00:12:59,274
okay, and I can pick him up tomorrow.

278
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,302
But he had to have stitches.

279
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,830
And he said that only once in a blue

280
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:06,247
moon does a dog's ear grow back.

281
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,344
Still hoping.

282
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,808
Now will you call your dad

283
00:13:13,808 --> 00:13:16,259
to let him know that his dog is okay?

284
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,845
I don't want to meet my father

285
00:13:18,845 --> 00:13:21,262
over the phone. What am I gonna say?

286
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,381
''I'm the daughter you abandoned.

287
00:13:23,381 --> 00:13:25,429
By the way, I broke your dog.''

288
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,406
Hey, Pheebs, if you want, I'll do it.

289
00:13:28,406 --> 00:13:30,374
Okay.

290
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,858
Listen, just don't say

291
00:13:32,858 --> 00:13:34,439
anything about me, okay?

292
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:41,283
Don't...be too long with the phone.

293
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,349
She'll be a much better friend

294
00:13:43,349 --> 00:13:45,345
once the market closes.

295
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:48,858
It's a woman.

296
00:13:48,858 --> 00:13:50,257
So talk to her.

297
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,400
Hello, Mrs. Buffay.

298
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,300
I know where your dog is.

299
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,905
I want you to know he'll be returned

300
00:14:01,905 --> 00:14:08,403
to you almost as good as new within 24 hours. Goodbye.

301
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,216
Why the voice?

302
00:14:16,216 --> 00:14:17,211
Hard to say.

303
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,359
Your cappuccino, sir.

304
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:24,259
Thank you.

305
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,245
This is better than the coffeehouse.

306
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:31,224
Absolutely.

307
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:40,861
How come it's not mixing

308
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:42,277
with the water?

309
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,845
The package says to keep it moving.

310
00:14:44,845 --> 00:14:47,342
Stir and drink, never let it settle.

311
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,459
Hey, this is ridiculous.

312
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:55,977
After I get back from

313
00:14:55,977 --> 00:14:59,929
my niece's christening we'll all go to the coffeehouse

314
00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:02,295
and have a nice cup of coffee.

315
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,427
No problem. Joey's there.

316
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,398
Okay.

317
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:07,853
No.

318
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:09,201
No?

319
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:11,907
I don't want to have to have Joey with

320
00:15:11,907 --> 00:15:14,506
me every time I want decent coffee.

321
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,777
And I don't want to drink

322
00:15:16,777 --> 00:15:18,307
cappuccino with a K.

323
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,964
I say we go down there

324
00:15:19,964 --> 00:15:21,511
and stand up to those guys.

325
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,334
All right, hang on

326
00:15:23,334 --> 00:15:24,414
a second, Custer.

327
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,889
Ross, have you been beaten up before?

328
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:29,453
Yeah, sure.

329
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,280
By someone besides Monica?

330
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,231
No.

331
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,797
So what if we get beaten up? Maybe

332
00:15:36,797 --> 00:15:39,328
it's something a man has to go through.

333
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:42,340
Like a rite of passage or something.

334
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,341
Couldn't we just lose

335
00:15:44,341 --> 00:15:46,241
our virginities again?

336
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,393
Because I think, actually,

337
00:15:48,393 --> 00:15:50,241
mine's growing back.

338
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,282
Are you with me or not? Come on.

339
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:54,444
I'm with you.

340
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:58,289
Just let me put on a clean pair

341
00:15:58,289 --> 00:16:00,223
of underwear for the hospital.

342
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,340
I need to borrow $100.

343
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,386
What?

344
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,330
Welcome home.

345
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,348
I need $100.

346
00:16:07,348 --> 00:16:08,298
For what?

347
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,830
To get back in the game.

348
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,326
When did you get out?

349
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,819
I don't know. I lost it all.

350
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:14,235
Oh, no.

351
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,853
I've come to terms with it,

352
00:16:15,853 --> 00:16:17,400
you have to, too.

353
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,312
Okay.

354
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:23,440
Look, Mon, I'm really sorry.

355
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,729
Where are we on the 100 bucks?

356
00:16:25,729 --> 00:16:27,242
I don't have it.

357
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,310
But, I need it!

358
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:31,355
Otherwise, I have to

359
00:16:31,355 --> 00:16:37,455
take that horrible diner job with the dancing and the costumes.

360
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,461
I don't want to have to wear

361
00:16:41,461 --> 00:16:43,457
flame-retardant boobs.

362
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,431
Nobody does, honey.

363
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,470
Hi.

364
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,465
Schnoodle!

365
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,309
Oh, my God. What the hell

366
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:56,374
happened to my dog?

367
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,916
It was an accident. The woman who did

368
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:01,384
this wouldn't hurt a dog on purpose.

369
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,184
She's a vegetarian.

370
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,436
Are these stitches?

371
00:17:05,436 --> 00:17:06,482
Eight of them.

372
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,387
That's 56 to him.

373
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:11,863
If it's raining, you can't

374
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:14,912
let him look up because that cone

375
00:17:14,912 --> 00:17:16,425
will fill up fast.

376
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,354
Thanks for bringing him back.

377
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:21,305
Sure. Is Frank home?

378
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,420
How do you know Frank?

379
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,433
Just from a long time ago. Is he here?

380
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,276
Yeah.

381
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,831
Frank!

382
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:31,315
Yeah?

383
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,248
What?

384
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,253
Oh, okay. I mean Frank Senior.

385
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,868
He went for groceries.

386
00:17:37,868 --> 00:17:39,415
Will he be back soon?

387
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,307
He left four years ago.

388
00:17:42,307 --> 00:17:44,355
We're expecting him back any minute.

389
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:48,415
I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog.

390
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:51,299
Everything. I'm sorry.

391
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,462
Hey, lady!

392
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,466
Hey, wait up!

393
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,243
How do you know my dad?

394
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:06,274
Well, I don't really just genetically.

395
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,376
He's kind of my dad too.

396
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,367
Heavy.

397
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:11,413
Yeah.

398
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,375
So did he ever talk about me?

399
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,326
Phoebe?

400
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,443
No, but he didn't really talk

401
00:18:18,443 --> 00:18:20,491
about anything.

402
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,198
Except stilts.

403
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,266
Stilts?

404
00:18:25,266 --> 00:18:26,329
Yeah, he loved stilts.

405
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,401
One time, I was upstairs stealing

406
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:36,261
cigarettes from my mom and all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head,

407
00:18:36,261 --> 00:18:38,309
bobbing past the window.

408
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,913
He had a big smile on his face

409
00:18:39,913 --> 00:18:42,937
and was waving because he was happiest

410
00:18:42,937 --> 00:18:44,421
on his stilts.

411
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,920
Wow.

412
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,416
Yeah.

413
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,296
I don't know what to do with that.

414
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,264
Me neither.

415
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:57,898
So you're, like, my big sister?

416
00:18:57,898 --> 00:18:59,428
Yeah.

417
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,372
This is huge. You can buy me beer!

418
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,409
I'm not gonna.

419
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,190
You know what? If you had a friend

420
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,169
named Pete, I could say:

421
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,778
''I know Pete.

422
00:19:11,778 --> 00:19:13,274
He's friends with my brother.''

423
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,802
I got a friend named Mark.

424
00:19:14,802 --> 00:19:16,286
That'll work.

425
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,289
Cool. All right.

426
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,803
So maybe, you know,

427
00:19:20,803 --> 00:19:23,283
I could give you a call sometime.

428
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,875
We could talk or something.

429
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,422
Yeah, that'd be okay.

430
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,897
All right.

431
00:19:27,897 --> 00:19:29,296
Okay, I'm in the book.

432
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,392
All right.

433
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,299
So stilts, huh?

434
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:38,825
If you want, I can show you where

435
00:19:38,825 --> 00:19:41,242
he hit his head on the rain gutter.

436
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,246
Okay.

437
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,934
Well, we did it. We're here.

438
00:19:47,934 --> 00:19:50,351
We are standing our ground.

439
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,371
How long does a cup of coffee take?

440
00:19:53,371 --> 00:19:55,419
Would you come on?!

441
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,429
Thank you.

442
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,358
There we go.

443
00:20:11,358 --> 00:20:13,275
I think we proved our point.

444
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,742
You burn your mouth?

445
00:20:15,742 --> 00:20:17,238
Cannot feel my tongue.

446
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,253
Bullies! Big bullies!

447
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:26,447
Look who's here. It's the weenies.

448
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,441
Didn't we make ourselves clear?

449
00:20:30,441 --> 00:20:32,489
Yes, and that's why we're here.

450
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,460
Yes, we're standing our ground.

451
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,468
Apparently.

452
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,385
Let's do this.

453
00:20:39,385 --> 00:20:40,500
What do you got, a weapon?

454
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,953
A nice watch.

455
00:20:42,953 --> 00:20:44,500
I don't want to break it on your ribs.

456
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,370
All right, let's do this.

457
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:50,395
Question: If I don't care about

458
00:20:50,395 --> 00:20:52,477
my watch, can I use it as a weapon?

459
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,932
What?

460
00:20:53,932 --> 00:20:55,280
It's sharp and metal.

461
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,804
I think I can do some serious

462
00:20:56,804 --> 00:20:58,288
damage with it.

463
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,423
No, you can't use your watch.

464
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,339
Or your keys.

465
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:04,351
Okay.

466
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,326
Here's what we'll do.

467
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,299
We'll put all keys and watches

468
00:21:08,299 --> 00:21:10,233
in the hat over there.

469
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,398
All right?

470
00:21:11,398 --> 00:21:12,427
Yeah, all right.

471
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:14,805
All right, come on, man.

472
00:21:14,805 --> 00:21:16,238
Let's do this!

473
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:19,435
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?

474
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,444
Of course. Why wouldn't we?

475
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,794
I have to work on Monday.

476
00:21:23,794 --> 00:21:25,341
I have a big presentation.

477
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,964
Actually, I gotta show

478
00:21:27,964 --> 00:21:29,477
this apartment tomorrow.

479
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,802
This no-faces thing

480
00:21:31,802 --> 00:21:33,349
might not be a bad idea.

481
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:39,387
Nothing from the neck up or the waist down.

482
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,880
Dana's ovulating.

483
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,461
Really? You guys trying again?

484
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,865
So we're strictly

485
00:21:45,865 --> 00:21:47,361
talking about the middle?

486
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:47,966
Come on!

487
00:21:47,966 --> 00:21:48,460
Hey!

488
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:49,940
Want some of this?

489
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,373
Want a piece of this?

490
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,467
I'm standing here! Huh?

491
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,495
Hey! Those guys are taking our stuff!

492
00:21:55,495 --> 00:21:57,412
Hey!

493
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,473
Get out of the way! Look out!

494
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:02,786
That was amazing.

495
00:22:02,786 --> 00:22:04,219
That was incredible.

496
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,388
You guys kicked butt!

497
00:22:05,388 --> 00:22:06,520
What about you?

498
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:08,743
You really gave it to

499
00:22:08,743 --> 00:22:10,227
Mr. Clean back there.

500
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,394
He was a big guy.

501
00:22:11,394 --> 00:22:12,526
He was, wasn't he?

502
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,347
I wouldn't know, having missed it all.

503
00:22:15,347 --> 00:22:17,429
Don't do that to yourself.

504
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,949
Any one of us could have tripped

505
00:22:19,949 --> 00:22:22,429
over that little girl's jump rope.

506
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:29,243
So listen, guys...are we okay here?

507
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,864
We're okay.

508
00:22:32,864 --> 00:22:34,445
So, can I have my hat back?

509
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:37,479
No.

510
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:53,496
Oh, my God. Look at her.

511
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,273
Hi, Monica!

512
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:57,499
How's it going?

513
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,402
Hey, nice boobs.

514
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:03,337
Guys, check this out.

515
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,331
Excellent.
