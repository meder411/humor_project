1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's got it on tap!

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad, did you talk about me?

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So where did you get the hat?

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know.

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're wearing the tie I got you!

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look, you're a big girl. I just hope

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
you know what you're doing.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, right. Well, actually,

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
we never got to you.

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In his apartment. The thing is built

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
into his bar. It's unbelievable!

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But he offered me a beer. Know what?

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At halftime,

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was gonna give him what for.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But he had the game on,

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
so we started watching.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And?

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was gonna punch him in the nose.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey, Dad. What are you doing here?

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just stopped by your boyfriend's.

24
00:00:06,395 --> 00:00:08,408
So, what do you think?

25
00:00:08,408 --> 00:00:10,421
Casa de Joey.

26
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,412
I decorated it myself.

27
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:13,424
Get out!

28
00:00:15,338 --> 00:00:17,397
Wow, Joey, this is....

29
00:00:18,207 --> 00:00:19,703
Art.

30
00:00:19,703 --> 00:00:21,199
Art it is.

31
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:22,826
Check this out.

32
00:00:22,826 --> 00:00:24,242
Is it a coffee table?

33
00:00:24,347 --> 00:00:25,877
Is it a panther?

34
00:00:25,877 --> 00:00:27,407
There's no need to decide.

35
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:31,409
Hey, nice pillow.

36
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:33,819
So now tell me,

37
00:00:33,819 --> 00:00:35,417
is this genuine Muppet skin?

38
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:39,224
Hey, excellent water table thing.

39
00:00:39,328 --> 00:00:41,825
Thanks. I love this. But you

40
00:00:41,825 --> 00:00:44,322
know what? It makes me want to pee.

41
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:45,900
Yeah, me too.

42
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,367
I think that's the challenge.

43
00:00:49,338 --> 00:00:52,273
How come Chandler didn't come?

44
00:00:54,276 --> 00:00:55,857
It's because he had

45
00:00:55,857 --> 00:00:57,438
a thing with the thing.

46
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:01,374
Right. I got it.

47
00:01:03,285 --> 00:01:04,832
So why don't you show us

48
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:06,379
the rest of your casa?

49
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,188
The best part! Come on.

50
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,325
Nice toilet.

51
00:01:20,403 --> 00:01:22,303
No. Behind it.

52
00:01:22,338 --> 00:01:24,334
You have a phone in here?

53
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:28,410
That's right. I have a phone in here.

54
00:01:29,412 --> 00:01:30,407
Promise me something.

55
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:31,402
Yeah?

56
00:01:31,447 --> 00:01:34,314
Never call me from that phone.

57
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:32,398
Okay, here we go.

58
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:35,760
Sorry, they were all out of apple pie.

59
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,211
Someone just got the last piece.

60
00:02:39,248 --> 00:02:40,345
Oh, my God!

61
00:02:40,345 --> 00:02:41,442
You won't believe this!

62
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:44,445
I have just been discovered.

63
00:02:46,222 --> 00:02:48,719
Now wait a minute. I claimed you

64
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,216
in the name of France four years ago.

65
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:54,418
Anyway.

66
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,981
Don't freak out and say how

67
00:02:56,981 --> 00:02:59,432
great this is until I'm done.

68
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:01,782
I met this producer

69
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:04,839
of this record company who said I have

70
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:08,291
a fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do

71
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,174
a demo of ''Smelly Cat.''

72
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:14,206
I told you not to do that yet.

73
00:03:16,185 --> 00:03:18,278
And she wants to do a video.

74
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:22,214
I'm not done yet, okay?

75
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:24,188
God!

76
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:27,206
If that goes well, they may

77
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,185
even want to make an album.

78
00:03:32,234 --> 00:03:34,202
I'm done now.

79
00:03:36,405 --> 00:03:38,356
If you care for me,

80
00:03:38,356 --> 00:03:40,307
get the pie out of the man's hood.

81
00:03:40,342 --> 00:03:41,889
Get the what?

82
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,436
There's a pie in the hood. Go!

83
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:52,387
What are you doing?

84
00:03:52,387 --> 00:03:54,355
I'm sorry. My pie was in your hood.

85
00:03:57,326 --> 00:04:01,729
I have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll

86
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:04,197
be back in the hospital by 7.

87
00:04:08,304 --> 00:04:10,283
Damn it, Ross!

88
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,262
Get your butt out of the bathroom!

89
00:04:12,374 --> 00:04:15,309
Calm down. I'm blow-drying.

90
00:04:15,411 --> 00:04:17,294
Blow-drying what?

91
00:04:17,294 --> 00:04:19,177
You have no hair.

92
00:04:20,216 --> 00:04:21,814
What's going on?

93
00:04:21,814 --> 00:04:23,412
He's been in there for an hour.

94
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,188
It's like I live with him again.

95
00:04:26,288 --> 00:04:28,256
He's here when I sleep, wake up

96
00:04:28,256 --> 00:04:30,224
and when I want to shower.

97
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:32,192
It's like I'm 1 6 again.

98
00:04:32,294 --> 00:04:33,761
Well, you're not 1 6.

99
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:35,228
You're both adults now.

100
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:37,296
Get out, you doofus!

101
00:04:40,236 --> 00:04:41,732
Or, you know,

102
00:04:41,732 --> 00:04:43,228
he's rubber and you're glue.

103
00:04:46,342 --> 00:04:48,207
All yours.

104
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:50,724
I hope you cleaned your hair

105
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,237
out of the drain.

106
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,279
Shut up!

107
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,308
Shut up.

108
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,513
Cut it out!

109
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,354
I've never wanted you more.

110
00:05:38,394 --> 00:05:40,191
Hello?

111
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:42,361
Louie? Where's Howard?

112
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:44,426
He went home.

113
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:47,293
He said he might stop up.

114
00:05:47,336 --> 00:05:49,315
He said to tell you

115
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:51,294
he wasn't feeling so good.

116
00:05:51,407 --> 00:05:54,205
Hey, what time do you get off?

117
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,440
I'm not feeling too good either.

118
00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:05,916
So, what do you say, boys?

119
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,446
Should I call him?

120
00:06:14,196 --> 00:06:16,244
You know what they say:

121
00:06:16,244 --> 00:06:21,395
Ask your slippers a question you're going crazy.

122
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:33,281
Freaking art!

123
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,400
Hello.

124
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,384
Hey.

125
00:06:37,186 --> 00:06:38,175
Hey!

126
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,381
Sorry I didn't make it over there.

127
00:06:40,422 --> 00:06:42,413
That's okay.

128
00:06:43,225 --> 00:06:45,216
You had a thing.

129
00:06:45,394 --> 00:06:48,392
I hear the place looks great.

130
00:06:48,392 --> 00:06:51,390
Forget about it. I'm having a ball!

131
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:53,316
How's the apartment doing?

132
00:06:53,316 --> 00:06:55,199
It's terrific.

133
00:06:55,237 --> 00:06:59,501
I mean, it's a regular space fest!

134
00:07:01,343 --> 00:07:03,174
Well, great.

135
00:07:03,278 --> 00:07:05,257
Yeah, I just wanted

136
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:07,236
to call and say hey.

137
00:07:09,151 --> 00:07:10,140
Well, okay.

138
00:07:11,253 --> 00:07:12,817
Was that the oven timer?

139
00:07:12,817 --> 00:07:14,381
That's right, my friend.

140
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,740
-It's time for....

141
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,190
-Baywatch!

142
00:07:22,264 --> 00:07:24,778
You believe Stephanie has skin cancer?

143
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,292
I can't believe she's lieutenant!

144
00:07:29,204 --> 00:07:30,284
That's because you love

145
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,364
Yasmine Bleeth.

146
00:07:32,174 --> 00:07:33,670
How could anyone not love

147
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,166
Yasmine Bleeth?

148
00:07:37,179 --> 00:07:38,271
They're running!

149
00:07:39,381 --> 00:07:40,877
See, this is the brilliance

150
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,373
of the show.

151
00:07:43,185 --> 00:07:45,415
I say always keep them running.

152
00:07:46,321 --> 00:07:48,186
All the time running!

153
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,221
Run!

154
00:07:51,193 --> 00:07:52,182
Run!

155
00:07:52,294 --> 00:07:55,229
Run, Yasmine! Run like the wind!

156
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,264
But you wanted to live by yourself.

157
00:07:59,264 --> 00:08:01,329
I did. I thought it'd be great.

158
00:08:01,437 --> 00:08:03,302
I figured I'd have time alone

159
00:08:03,302 --> 00:08:05,167
with my thoughts.

160
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,191
It turns out I don't have

161
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:09,142
as many thoughts as you'd think.

162
00:08:10,245 --> 00:08:11,741
Why don't you talk to Chandler

163
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,237
and move back?

164
00:08:13,282 --> 00:08:15,312
You really think he'd take me?

165
00:08:15,312 --> 00:08:19,921
We had a good talk last night but when I moved, I hurt him bad.

166
00:08:19,921 --> 00:08:22,389
He would definitely want you back.

167
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:24,654
I'm telling you,

168
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:26,150
no way he's moving back.

169
00:08:26,261 --> 00:08:28,257
But we had one of the greatest

170
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,253
talks we ever had last night.

171
00:08:30,365 --> 00:08:32,162
I mean, it was--

172
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:33,685
It was like when we first

173
00:08:33,685 --> 00:08:35,169
lived together.

174
00:08:35,304 --> 00:08:36,788
I know you don't want

175
00:08:36,788 --> 00:08:40,787
to hear this now but we've seen him

176
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:43,267
in his new place. And he's happy.

177
00:08:43,378 --> 00:08:45,403
He's decorated.

178
00:08:46,381 --> 00:08:48,377
Chandler, he has moved on, okay?

179
00:08:48,377 --> 00:08:50,373
You have to, too.

180
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:52,398
You have to accept the fact

181
00:08:52,398 --> 00:08:54,377
that you're just friends now.

182
00:08:54,456 --> 00:08:59,285
You're not roommates anymore.

183
00:09:00,162 --> 00:09:02,153
Okay, you ready to try one?

184
00:09:02,331 --> 00:09:03,389
Okay.

185
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:09,135
Smelly cat, smelly cat

186
00:09:09,238 --> 00:09:11,365
What are they feeding you?

187
00:09:12,274 --> 00:09:13,804
Smelly, smelly

188
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,334
Really bad smelling smelly cat

189
00:09:16,144 --> 00:09:18,169
Whoa! Oh, my God!

190
00:09:20,282 --> 00:09:23,251
I mean, like, who was that?

191
00:09:24,286 --> 00:09:26,282
They're your backup singers.

192
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:28,278
Behind you, hon.

193
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,260
I thought they were just watching me.

194
00:09:32,294 --> 00:09:35,195
Like at an aquarium, you know?

195
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:37,231
They're so good. You're so good!

196
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:39,165
Alrighty!

197
00:09:39,268 --> 00:09:41,719
Okay, now that everyone knows

198
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:44,170
everyone, let's try it again.

199
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:45,195
From the top.

200
00:09:45,274 --> 00:09:48,300
Smelly cat, smelly cat

201
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:51,379
What are they feeding you?

202
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,279
Smelly, smelly, smelly, really bad

203
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:56,378
Smelling smelly cat. It's not your--

204
00:09:57,185 --> 00:09:58,300
Okay, sorry.

205
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,787
I'm just not getting that everyone gets how smelly

206
00:10:02,787 --> 00:10:05,386
this cat actually is.

207
00:10:06,228 --> 00:10:08,810
If we could talk about this. I need

208
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,392
to feel that you care about the cat.

209
00:10:14,236 --> 00:10:16,232
We can talk, but this costs

210
00:10:16,232 --> 00:10:18,228
$100 a minute to be in here.

211
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:20,355
Okay, so the cat stinks,

212
00:10:20,355 --> 00:10:22,403
but you love it. Let's go.

213
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:24,826
No, there is no way

214
00:10:24,826 --> 00:10:26,407
he was a velociraptor.

215
00:10:26,515 --> 00:10:28,449
Look at the cranial ridge.

216
00:10:29,217 --> 00:10:31,282
If Dino was a velociraptor,

217
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:33,347
he would have eaten the Flintstones.

218
00:10:35,324 --> 00:10:36,837
Were you taking a nap?

219
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:38,350
I was.

220
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,910
Can you hold on?

221
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,360
That's the other line.

222
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,454
Hello?

223
00:10:43,231 --> 00:10:44,727
Yeah, she's here,

224
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,223
but can she call you back?

225
00:10:46,335 --> 00:10:47,427
Okay, thanks.

226
00:10:48,236 --> 00:10:49,282
Call Joanna.

227
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,328
She leave a number?

228
00:10:50,372 --> 00:10:53,273
Did you see me write one down?

229
00:10:54,343 --> 00:10:57,335
I don't have her number, butt-munch.

230
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,331
She'll call back. Don't be a baby.

231
00:11:00,331 --> 00:11:02,282
You're the baby.

232
00:11:02,317 --> 00:11:03,346
Off my back.

233
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:04,375
Get out of my face.

234
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,379
Wait, hold on, Tony. Hold on.

235
00:11:08,223 --> 00:11:09,315
Hello?

236
00:11:09,491 --> 00:11:11,220
Hi.

237
00:11:11,326 --> 00:11:14,193
Yeah, No. she's right here. Hold on.

238
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,209
Tony, can I call you back?

239
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:19,188
That's my sister's boyfriend.

240
00:11:19,301 --> 00:11:20,768
Give me that.

241
00:11:20,768 --> 00:11:22,235
Okay.

242
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:26,271
Sweetie, before I forget, did I

243
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:28,336
leave my diaphragm at your place?

244
00:11:30,245 --> 00:11:32,213
Hi, Mom.

245
00:11:53,368 --> 00:11:56,360
So how's the palace?

246
00:11:56,438 --> 00:11:58,372
Funny you should mention that,

247
00:11:58,372 --> 00:12:00,306
because I was thinking--

248
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:02,400
What's with the boxes?

249
00:12:04,312 --> 00:12:06,405
Actually, I have some news.

250
00:12:07,182 --> 00:12:08,797
Is Joey gonna pick up

251
00:12:08,797 --> 00:12:10,412
his moose hat or should I toss it?

252
00:12:11,386 --> 00:12:13,399
Why don't you ask him yourself?

253
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,412
This is my roommate, Eddie.

254
00:12:16,191 --> 00:12:17,704
Nice to meet you.

255
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:19,217
Likewise.

256
00:12:19,394 --> 00:12:21,862
I'll take that.

257
00:12:21,862 --> 00:12:24,330
It's what I came for.

258
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,912
So this is new.

259
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,425
Where did you two meet?

260
00:12:28,203 --> 00:12:29,801
At the supermarket

261
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:31,399
in the ethnic food section.

262
00:12:32,207 --> 00:12:34,505
I helped him pick a chorizo.

263
00:12:36,344 --> 00:12:38,374
We got to talking. He needed

264
00:12:38,374 --> 00:12:40,404
a place and I had a spare room.

265
00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:43,316
Oh, now it's a spare room?

266
00:12:43,418 --> 00:12:44,868
Well, yeah.

267
00:12:44,868 --> 00:12:48,446
In that it's not being used and I have it to spare.

268
00:12:50,425 --> 00:12:53,417
Well, I got what I came for.

269
00:12:56,264 --> 00:12:58,255
I'll see you guys.

270
00:13:00,202 --> 00:13:01,362
Hey, Joe.

271
00:13:01,403 --> 00:13:02,836
When'd you start using

272
00:13:02,836 --> 00:13:04,269
moose in your hair?

273
00:13:06,374 --> 00:13:09,207
Is this guy great or what?

274
00:13:09,277 --> 00:13:12,178
Yeah, yeah, he is.

275
00:13:18,286 --> 00:13:20,334
He has a new roommate? Who is he?

276
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:22,382
Eddie. He just met him.

277
00:13:22,491 --> 00:13:24,840
It'll never last.

278
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,189
He's just a rebound roommate.

279
00:13:30,298 --> 00:13:32,289
Check it out! Check it out!

280
00:13:32,334 --> 00:13:35,326
It's ''Smelly Cat,'' the video!

281
00:13:36,404 --> 00:13:38,855
Now, I haven't seen it yet,

282
00:13:38,855 --> 00:13:43,326
so if you don't like it so what?

283
00:13:43,326 --> 00:13:45,243
None of you ever made a video.

284
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,313
Get out of here, cat! You stink!

285
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:05,228
Smoking!

286
00:14:05,228 --> 00:14:06,257
Look at me!

287
00:14:06,368 --> 00:14:09,269
Smelly cat, smelly cat

288
00:14:10,205 --> 00:14:13,174
What are they feeding you?

289
00:14:13,275 --> 00:14:16,403
Smelly cat, smelly cat

290
00:14:17,212 --> 00:14:20,409
It's not your fault

291
00:14:24,186 --> 00:14:26,285
Smelly, smelly, really bad smelling

292
00:14:26,285 --> 00:14:28,384
Smelly cat, it's not your fault

293
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:31,284
Smelly cat, smelly cat

294
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:32,355
Oh, my God!

295
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:33,384
I know.

296
00:14:33,428 --> 00:14:35,419
I sound amazing!

297
00:14:39,301 --> 00:14:41,769
They won't take you to the vet

298
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:44,237
You're obviously not their favorite pet

299
00:14:44,306 --> 00:14:46,433
Smelly cat, smelly cat

300
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:50,201
It's not your fault

301
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:52,202
Oh, no

302
00:14:52,314 --> 00:14:54,862
I've never heard myself sing before.

303
00:14:54,862 --> 00:14:57,410
I mean, except in my own head.

304
00:14:57,452 --> 00:14:59,403
This is so cool!

305
00:14:59,403 --> 00:15:01,354
Now I can hear what you hear!

306
00:15:02,257 --> 00:15:04,248
Pretty different, huh?

307
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,328
I am sorry,

308
00:15:07,328 --> 00:15:09,296
but I'm incredibly talented!

309
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:12,393
Smelly cat, smelly cat

310
00:15:13,168 --> 00:15:15,363
It's not your fault

311
00:15:26,281 --> 00:15:27,731
Joey, what's going on, man?

312
00:15:27,731 --> 00:15:29,181
Eddie.

313
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:30,799
Morning.

314
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,181
Morning.

315
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,383
I just came by to pick up my mail.

316
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,388
Where's the mail?

317
00:15:37,388 --> 00:15:38,485
Over on the table.

318
00:15:39,394 --> 00:15:41,385
It's not on this table anymore?

319
00:15:41,496 --> 00:15:44,397
No. Eddie likes to keep it over there.

320
00:15:47,402 --> 00:15:49,353
All right, here you go, my friend.

321
00:15:49,353 --> 00:15:51,304
Eggs à Ia Eddie.

322
00:15:56,344 --> 00:15:58,403
That's great.

323
00:16:00,348 --> 00:16:01,337
What?

324
00:16:01,383 --> 00:16:04,318
I thought you liked eggs with bread

325
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:07,253
with the hole in the middle à Ia me!

326
00:16:07,355 --> 00:16:09,306
I do, but Eddie makes them this way.

327
00:16:09,306 --> 00:16:11,257
They're darn good.

328
00:16:11,393 --> 00:16:12,388
Wanna try some?

329
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,383
No, thanks.

330
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:16,278
All right. Well, you guys,

331
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:18,394
I'm out of here.

332
00:16:19,301 --> 00:16:20,347
See you, pals.

333
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:21,393
See you.

334
00:16:24,372 --> 00:16:26,340
How are you two getting along?

335
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,308
I couldn't be happier.

336
00:16:28,376 --> 00:16:32,278
Great. I'm happy for you.

337
00:16:35,216 --> 00:16:37,275
All right, that's it!

338
00:16:37,385 --> 00:16:39,836
He just comes in here,

339
00:16:39,836 --> 00:16:42,287
Mr. Johnny New Eggs, with his--

340
00:16:43,325 --> 00:16:45,759
His moving the mail

341
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,193
and his, ''See you, pals.''

342
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:51,322
There's no juice!

343
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:54,317
There's no juice for the people

344
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:57,201
who need the juice. I need the juice!

345
00:16:57,238 --> 00:16:58,705
There's another carton

346
00:16:58,705 --> 00:17:00,172
right over there.

347
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,859
This isn't about juice anymore,

348
00:17:01,859 --> 00:17:03,343
all right?

349
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:05,709
All right. What's it about?

350
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:07,239
Eggs!

351
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,817
Whose eggs do you like better,

352
00:17:09,817 --> 00:17:11,284
his or mine?

353
00:17:11,353 --> 00:17:12,786
I like both eggs equally!

354
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:14,219
Come on!

355
00:17:14,389 --> 00:17:16,772
Nobody likes two eggs equally!

356
00:17:16,772 --> 00:17:19,155
Which one do you like better?

357
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,273
What's the difference?

358
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,286
Your eggs aren't here anymore!

359
00:17:23,365 --> 00:17:26,232
You took your eggs and you left!

360
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:28,252
Did you expect me

361
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:30,203
to never find new eggs?

362
00:17:30,305 --> 00:17:32,466
Maybe this isn't about the eggs.

363
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,187
Maybe this is about

364
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,166
the chicken that laid them.

365
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:40,814
What chicken?

366
00:17:40,814 --> 00:17:42,247
There's no chicken.

367
00:17:42,317 --> 00:17:44,376
I can't talk to you!

368
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,857
I want Entertainment Tonight.

369
00:17:49,857 --> 00:17:54,259
We're watching Predators of the Serengeti.

370
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:55,876
Would you guys stop?!

371
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:57,423
It's my TV!

372
00:17:58,233 --> 00:17:58,727
Quit it!

373
00:17:58,727 --> 00:17:59,221
Bite me!

374
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:00,232
Oh, my God!

375
00:18:00,335 --> 00:18:03,236
Monica keeps changing the channel.

376
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:06,206
Great. Why don't you tell Mommy on me?

377
00:18:06,341 --> 00:18:09,333
Now I'm Mommy in this little play?

378
00:18:09,377 --> 00:18:12,312
Look, I refuse to get sucked into this

379
00:18:12,312 --> 00:18:15,247
weird little Geller dimension thing!

380
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,817
I'm gonna take a nice long,

381
00:18:16,817 --> 00:18:19,870
hot bubble bath because you kids

382
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,354
are driving me crazy!

383
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:26,243
What do we do about this?

384
00:18:26,243 --> 00:18:28,194
Tape Entertainment Tonight.

385
00:18:28,296 --> 00:18:31,265
Not that! This! Us!

386
00:18:31,366 --> 00:18:32,782
Oh, my God, Ross....

387
00:18:32,782 --> 00:18:34,198
You're just....

388
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:35,719
Since you've been here,

389
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:37,169
you drive....

390
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:38,735
Mon, you've gone ultrasonic

391
00:18:38,735 --> 00:18:40,265
again, all right?

392
00:18:40,475 --> 00:18:45,201
I just can't stand you being here all the time!

393
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,731
Why? Why can't you stand me

394
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:50,182
being here? We're just having fun.

395
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:52,412
Fun? You think this is fun?

396
00:18:54,222 --> 00:18:55,803
We were fooling around,

397
00:18:55,803 --> 00:18:57,384
like when we were kids.

398
00:18:58,193 --> 00:19:01,162
I hated you when we were kids!

399
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,143
You hated me when we were kids?

400
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:08,731
I hated you. I loved you in a you're-my-brother-so-I-have-to

401
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,228
way, but basically I hated your guts.

402
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:13,739
Why did you hate me?

403
00:19:13,739 --> 00:19:18,309
Because you were mean to me and you teased me

404
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:20,374
and you always got your way.

405
00:19:21,249 --> 00:19:24,150
And that wasn't fun for you?

406
00:19:27,188 --> 00:19:29,179
I can't believe you hated me.

407
00:19:30,358 --> 00:19:33,293
But now I love you.

408
00:19:35,163 --> 00:19:36,710
And not just because I have to.

409
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,257
Really?

410
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:40,163
Yeah.

411
00:19:41,202 --> 00:19:42,783
You're just gonna have to stop

412
00:19:42,783 --> 00:19:44,364
pissing me off.

413
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:50,309
I can do that.

414
00:19:50,378 --> 00:19:53,211
Then I won't have to kill you.

415
00:19:56,184 --> 00:19:57,748
So you wanna watch

416
00:19:57,748 --> 00:19:59,312
Entertainment Tonight?

417
00:19:59,387 --> 00:20:01,184
Thanks.

418
00:20:01,222 --> 00:20:02,718
Tonight, America's sport's

419
00:20:02,718 --> 00:20:04,214
magazine moves to--

420
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:05,355
You know what?

421
00:20:05,355 --> 00:20:06,418
What?

422
00:20:07,195 --> 00:20:09,191
If you really wanna watch

423
00:20:09,191 --> 00:20:11,187
that Serengeti thing, we can.

424
00:20:11,232 --> 00:20:12,324
Okay.

425
00:20:20,408 --> 00:20:21,904
Listen, you are not going

426
00:20:21,904 --> 00:20:24,927
to believe this but that is not me

427
00:20:24,927 --> 00:20:26,343
singing on the video.

428
00:20:31,219 --> 00:20:32,345
How did you find out?

429
00:20:32,453 --> 00:20:34,853
The record company sent a paper

430
00:20:34,853 --> 00:20:39,276
for me to sign saying it's okay for someone else to sing for me.

431
00:20:39,276 --> 00:20:41,227
That was a clue.

432
00:20:41,462 --> 00:20:43,225
What will you do?

433
00:20:43,331 --> 00:20:45,299
I can't work with people who do this.

434
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:47,267
Sure.

435
00:20:47,335 --> 00:20:49,286
I mean, this poor woman.

436
00:20:49,286 --> 00:20:51,237
What woman?

437
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:52,328
The voice woman.

438
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,357
She has a great voice,

439
00:20:54,357 --> 00:20:56,274
but she doesn't have a video.

440
00:20:56,344 --> 00:20:58,357
Okay, Pheebs, what about you?

441
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,370
I have a video. Pay attention.

442
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:07,211
This voice woman, she's so talented.

443
00:21:07,322 --> 00:21:09,802
But according to the producer people,

444
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:12,282
she doesn't have the right look.

445
00:21:12,393 --> 00:21:13,906
She's like one of those

446
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:17,846
animals at the pound who nobody wants

447
00:21:17,846 --> 00:21:19,495
because they're not pretty enough.

448
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:21,332
Or some old dog

449
00:21:21,332 --> 00:21:22,429
who's kind of stinky and--

450
00:21:23,204 --> 00:21:25,399
Oh, my God! She's ''Smelly Cat''!

451
00:21:28,343 --> 00:21:31,403
That song has so many levels.

452
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:34,237
Hey, Eddie.

453
00:21:34,349 --> 00:21:36,340
You wanna play some foosball?

454
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:38,334
No, thanks, man.

455
00:21:38,334 --> 00:21:40,251
I'm not really into sports.

456
00:21:45,226 --> 00:21:47,353
Yeah, okay. All right.

457
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:49,942
Doesn't matter.

458
00:21:49,942 --> 00:21:51,455
Time for Baywatch!

459
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:55,427
You like that show?

460
00:21:57,272 --> 00:21:59,365
You don't like that show?

461
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:02,226
It's just pretty people

462
00:22:02,226 --> 00:22:04,177
running around on the beach.

463
00:22:04,212 --> 00:22:06,373
That's the brilliance of it.

464
00:22:08,383 --> 00:22:10,408
The pretty people.

465
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:13,387
And the running.

466
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,803
I'm gonna go read in my room

467
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:18,316
for a little while.

468
00:22:19,327 --> 00:22:21,295
Okay, man.

469
00:23:18,386 --> 00:23:20,803
I'm gonna start off with a little

470
00:23:20,803 --> 00:23:23,220
song called ''Smelly Cat.''

471
00:23:23,424 --> 00:23:25,807
Oh, for those of you who are

472
00:23:25,807 --> 00:23:28,190
wondering, this is my real voice.

473
00:23:28,329 --> 00:23:31,321
Smelly cat, smelly cat

474
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:32,895
What are they feeding you?

475
00:23:32,895 --> 00:23:34,391
Everybody!

476
00:23:34,435 --> 00:23:37,404
Smelly cat, smelly cat

477
00:23:38,206 --> 00:23:40,231
It's not your fault

478
00:23:40,308 --> 00:23:41,804
Monica!

479
00:23:41,804 --> 00:23:43,300
-They won't take you to the vet

480
00:23:43,344 --> 00:23:45,312
Chandler!

481
00:23:47,248 --> 00:23:48,345
You're obviously not

482
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:49,442
their favorite pet

483
00:23:50,218 --> 00:23:51,731
Joey!

484
00:23:51,731 --> 00:23:53,244
-You may not be a bed of roses

485
00:23:53,321 --> 00:23:55,369
Rachel!

486
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:57,417
You're no friend to those with noses

487
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:59,358
Ross, those are

488
00:23:59,358 --> 00:24:01,258
the only lines we have. Sorry.

489
00:24:02,196 --> 00:24:04,226
Back to the chorus everybody!

490
00:24:04,226 --> 00:24:06,256
Smelly cat, smelly cat

491
00:24:07,201 --> 00:24:09,362
What are they feeding you

492
00:24:10,204 --> 00:24:13,184
Smelly cat, smelly cat

493
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:16,164
It's not your fault

494
00:24:16,277 --> 00:24:19,371
Smelly cat, smelly cat

495
00:24:20,181 --> 00:24:23,207
What are they feeding you

496
00:24:23,284 --> 00:24:26,276
Smelly cat, smelly cat

497
00:24:26,387 --> 00:24:29,185
It's not your fault
