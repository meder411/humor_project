1
00:00:07,404 --> 00:00:08,934
She's having my baby,

2
00:00:08,934 --> 00:00:10,464
and she's not here yet.

3
00:00:10,573 --> 00:00:12,023
Has her water broken yet?

4
00:00:12,023 --> 00:00:13,473
I don't know.

5
00:00:14,277 --> 00:00:16,325
When we talked, she said she'd

6
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:18,373
already passed the mucous plug.

7
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:22,408
Do we have to know about that?

8
00:00:23,319 --> 00:00:24,365
What'll you do

9
00:00:24,365 --> 00:00:25,411
when you have a baby?

10
00:00:25,488 --> 00:00:27,405
I'll be in the waiting room,

11
00:00:27,405 --> 00:00:29,322
handing out cigars.

12
00:00:29,392 --> 00:00:31,889
Joey's made arrangements to have

13
00:00:31,889 --> 00:00:34,386
his baby in a movie from the '50s.

14
00:00:35,398 --> 00:00:38,390
She could be giving birth in the cab.

15
00:00:38,501 --> 00:00:40,048
Relax. It's only $2

16
00:00:40,048 --> 00:00:44,401
for the first contraction and then 50 cents for each

17
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:46,397
additional contraction.

18
00:00:46,509 --> 00:00:48,056
What, it's okay

19
00:00:48,056 --> 00:00:49,603
when Chandler does it?

20
00:00:50,346 --> 00:00:52,541
You have to pick your moments.

21
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:54,508
Did I miss it?

22
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:56,035
She's not here yet.

23
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:57,519
What's with the guitar?

24
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:00,289
We might be here for a while.

25
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:02,257
Things might get musical.

26
00:01:02,392 --> 00:01:04,326
Where have you been?

27
00:01:04,326 --> 00:01:06,260
We stopped at the gift shop.

28
00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:07,358
I got this,

29
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,387
and Susan wanted a Chunky.

30
00:01:08,465 --> 00:01:10,478
You're having a baby.

31
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:12,491
You don't stop for Chunkies.

32
00:01:13,303 --> 00:01:16,272
I used to have that bumper sticker.

33
00:01:16,473 --> 00:01:18,498
You see what I mean?

34
00:02:05,488 --> 00:02:07,388
''Stopped for a Chunky.''

35
00:02:07,388 --> 00:02:09,288
Let it go, Ross.

36
00:02:09,392 --> 00:02:10,387
I got an extra one.

37
00:02:10,387 --> 00:02:11,382
You want this?

38
00:02:15,398 --> 00:02:17,349
How's my favorite parenting team?

39
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:19,300
Dr. Franzblau.

40
00:02:19,369 --> 00:02:20,865
I understand you're thinking

41
00:02:20,865 --> 00:02:22,361
of having a baby.

42
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:24,401
I see you're nine months pregnant.

43
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:26,397
That's a good start.

44
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,794
How are your contractions?

45
00:02:28,794 --> 00:02:30,278
I love them.

46
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,927
Each one's like a little party

47
00:02:31,927 --> 00:02:33,474
in my uterus.

48
00:02:34,284 --> 00:02:36,297
Every 4 minutes, lasting 55 seconds.

49
00:02:36,297 --> 00:02:38,310
59 seconds. Quartz.

50
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:40,378
Swiss quartz.

51
00:02:42,492 --> 00:02:43,988
Am I allowed to drink anything?

52
00:02:43,988 --> 00:02:45,484
Ice chips.

53
00:02:45,595 --> 00:02:46,994
At the nurse's station.

54
00:02:46,994 --> 00:02:48,393
I'll get it!

55
00:02:48,498 --> 00:02:49,948
No, I'll get it.

56
00:02:49,948 --> 00:02:51,398
No, I'm getting it.

57
00:02:52,502 --> 00:02:54,402
Hi. Thought you might like

58
00:02:54,402 --> 00:02:56,302
some ice chips.

59
00:02:56,506 --> 00:02:58,019
Thanks.

60
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,470
And if you need anything else-- I do not believe we've met.

61
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:04,471
I'm Rachel Greene.

62
00:03:05,281 --> 00:03:06,811
I'm Carol's ex-husband's

63
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,341
sister's roommate.

64
00:03:08,484 --> 00:03:09,917
Nice to meet you.

65
00:03:09,917 --> 00:03:11,350
I'm Dr. Franzblau.

66
00:03:11,387 --> 00:03:13,867
I'm your roommate's brother's

67
00:03:13,867 --> 00:03:16,347
ex-wife's obstetrician.

68
00:03:16,492 --> 00:03:18,357
Oh, that's funny.

69
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:27,360
I want a baby.

70
00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:29,337
Not tonight, honey.

71
00:03:29,337 --> 00:03:31,271
I got an early day tomorrow.

72
00:03:31,307 --> 00:03:33,440
Get up. Let's get some coffee.

73
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,573
Okay, because we never do that.

74
00:03:37,313 --> 00:03:39,343
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

75
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:41,373
Or just fall down. That's good too.

76
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:43,407
Knick fan?

77
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,902
Oh, boy, do they suck.

78
00:03:45,902 --> 00:03:48,285
Listen, lady--

79
00:03:49,492 --> 00:03:51,585
Look. Look at your man, Ewing.

80
00:03:52,328 --> 00:03:53,875
He couldn't hit water

81
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,422
if he was standing on a boat.

82
00:03:55,531 --> 00:03:56,964
And who do you like?

83
00:03:56,964 --> 00:03:58,397
Celtics.

84
00:03:58,434 --> 00:04:01,426
Celtics? They couldn't hit a boat if--

85
00:04:02,238 --> 00:04:03,466
Wait....

86
00:04:04,474 --> 00:04:06,465
They suck, all right?

87
00:04:07,343 --> 00:04:08,389
Shut up.

88
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:09,435
It's a rebuilding year--

89
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:13,315
Let me get the father.

90
00:04:13,315 --> 00:04:15,249
We need a father over here.

91
00:04:15,351 --> 00:04:17,285
There's no father.

92
00:04:19,255 --> 00:04:21,251
Oh, sorry.

93
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:23,247
That's okay. I'm fine.

94
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,394
Okay. Right this way.

95
00:04:26,462 --> 00:04:28,430
All the other pregnant women

96
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,398
seem to be going in here.

97
00:04:36,472 --> 00:04:38,423
They're tiny and chubby

98
00:04:38,423 --> 00:04:40,374
And so sweet to touch

99
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,361
But soon they'll grow up

100
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:44,312
And resent you so much

101
00:04:46,316 --> 00:04:48,295
Now they're yelling at you

102
00:04:48,295 --> 00:04:50,274
And you don't know why

103
00:04:50,386 --> 00:04:52,382
And you cry and you cry

104
00:04:52,382 --> 00:04:54,378
And you cry

105
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:55,954
And you cry and you cry

106
00:04:55,954 --> 00:04:57,484
And you cry

107
00:04:57,527 --> 00:04:59,392
Thanks, Ross.

108
00:04:59,392 --> 00:05:01,257
I'm paying you to stop.

109
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:05,345
Oh, look, twins.

110
00:05:05,345 --> 00:05:07,324
Hi, guys. Oh, cute.

111
00:05:08,438 --> 00:05:09,427
No fair.

112
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:11,336
I don't even have one.

113
00:05:11,336 --> 00:05:12,433
How come they get two?

114
00:05:13,242 --> 00:05:14,305
You'll get one.

115
00:05:14,305 --> 00:05:15,368
When?

116
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:17,958
Tell you what. When we're 40,

117
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:22,478
if neither of us are married what do you say we have one?

118
00:05:23,252 --> 00:05:24,748
Why won't I be married

119
00:05:24,748 --> 00:05:26,244
when I'm 40?

120
00:05:26,356 --> 00:05:28,290
I just meant hypothetically.

121
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:30,387
Hypothetically, why won't I be

122
00:05:30,387 --> 00:05:32,383
married when I'm 40?

123
00:05:33,262 --> 00:05:35,327
What is it? Is there something

124
00:05:35,327 --> 00:05:37,392
unmarriable about me?

125
00:05:38,368 --> 00:05:39,494
Well?

126
00:05:40,303 --> 00:05:41,787
Dear God!

127
00:05:41,787 --> 00:05:43,271
This parachute is a knapsack.

128
00:05:47,477 --> 00:05:49,502
Look at you, dressy-dress.

129
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,574
Did you go home and change?

130
00:05:52,315 --> 00:05:53,913
It's an important day.

131
00:05:53,913 --> 00:05:55,511
I want to look nice.

132
00:05:56,386 --> 00:05:58,377
Has Dr. Franzblau been by--?

133
00:05:59,522 --> 00:06:01,217
I haven't seen him.

134
00:06:01,324 --> 00:06:02,774
Where is he?

135
00:06:02,774 --> 00:06:04,224
He is supposed to be here.

136
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:08,320
What if the baby needs him?

137
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:10,831
What's the deal with you and doctors?

138
00:06:10,831 --> 00:06:13,231
Is your father a doctor?

139
00:06:13,269 --> 00:06:14,327
Yeah. Why?

140
00:06:15,438 --> 00:06:17,269
No reason.

141
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,271
Mom, we've been through this.

142
00:06:21,344 --> 00:06:23,471
No, I am not calling him.

143
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,810
I don't care if it is his kid,

144
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:27,340
the guy's a jerk.

145
00:06:27,383 --> 00:06:29,317
No, I am not alone.

146
00:06:29,317 --> 00:06:31,251
Joey's here.

147
00:06:32,255 --> 00:06:33,483
What do you mean ''Joey who''?

148
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:35,281
Joey who?

149
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:36,887
Tribbiani.

150
00:06:36,887 --> 00:06:38,383
Joey Tribbiani.

151
00:06:39,462 --> 00:06:43,398
Yes. Okay. Hold on.

152
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:45,490
She wants to talk to you.

153
00:06:46,402 --> 00:06:47,562
Take the phone.

154
00:06:49,372 --> 00:06:50,464
Yeah, it's me.

155
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,366
No, we're just friends.

156
00:06:55,378 --> 00:06:56,504
Yeah, I'm single.

157
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,277
Twenty-five.

158
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:02,417
An actor. Hello?

159
00:07:07,423 --> 00:07:10,256
She's not much of a phone person.

160
00:07:10,326 --> 00:07:12,277
So, what's the deal

161
00:07:12,277 --> 00:07:14,228
with this father guy?

162
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,298
If someone was having my baby,

163
00:07:16,298 --> 00:07:18,266
I'd wanna know about it.

164
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:20,847
Hey, Knick fan, am I interested

165
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:23,327
in your views on fatherhood? No.

166
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:27,771
Maybe I should just go.

167
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:29,267
Maybe you should.

168
00:07:29,378 --> 00:07:34,249
Good luck...and take care.

169
00:07:40,356 --> 00:07:41,903
The Celtics problem is that

170
00:07:41,903 --> 00:07:43,450
the players run the team.

171
00:07:43,493 --> 00:07:45,376
That is so not true.

172
00:07:45,376 --> 00:07:47,259
Oh, it is.

173
00:07:47,296 --> 00:07:48,280
Breathe.

174
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,264
Breathe.

175
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:51,364
You're gonna kill me.

176
00:07:52,268 --> 00:07:54,264
Fifteen more seconds. 1 4, 13, 1 2--

177
00:07:54,264 --> 00:07:56,260
Count faster.

178
00:07:56,372 --> 00:07:58,340
It'll be okay. Keep focusing on Jordy.

179
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,308
He'll be here soon.

180
00:08:00,343 --> 00:08:02,373
Three. Two. Who the hell is Jordy?

181
00:08:02,373 --> 00:08:04,403
Your son.

182
00:08:05,214 --> 00:08:07,210
I don't have a son named Jordy.

183
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,206
We all agreed on Jamie.

184
00:08:09,252 --> 00:08:10,782
Jamie was the name

185
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:14,346
of Susan's first girlfriend so we went back to Jordy.

186
00:08:14,524 --> 00:08:16,873
What do you mean, back to Jordy?

187
00:08:16,873 --> 00:08:19,222
We never landed on Jordy.

188
00:08:19,262 --> 00:08:21,361
We just passed by it during the whole

189
00:08:21,361 --> 00:08:23,460
Jesse-Cody-Dillon fiasco.

190
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,426
Ow! Leg cramp!

191
00:08:27,236 --> 00:08:28,282
I got it.

192
00:08:28,282 --> 00:08:29,328
I got it. I'm doing it.

193
00:08:29,372 --> 00:08:30,418
You get to sleep with her.

194
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:31,464
I get the cramps.

195
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:33,265
No, you don't.

196
00:08:33,342 --> 00:08:34,388
That is it.

197
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,434
I want both of you out.

198
00:08:35,478 --> 00:08:36,410
She started it.

199
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,342
He did.

200
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,910
I'm trying to get

201
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:43,246
a person out of my body here and you're not making it

202
00:08:43,246 --> 00:08:45,242
any easier! Now go!

203
00:08:47,256 --> 00:08:47,870
Thanks.

204
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,484
See what you did?

205
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:50,276
Listen--

206
00:08:50,276 --> 00:08:51,260
Out!

207
00:08:53,296 --> 00:08:55,457
Breathe. Breathe.

208
00:09:02,238 --> 00:09:05,298
What is that? Something exploded.

209
00:09:06,342 --> 00:09:07,923
That's not the baby, is it?

210
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:09,504
Her water broke. Calm down.

211
00:09:10,246 --> 00:09:11,776
Water breaking?

212
00:09:11,776 --> 00:09:13,306
What do you mean? What's that?

213
00:09:13,416 --> 00:09:15,350
Breathe. Breathe.

214
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,888
I'm okay. I'm okay.

215
00:09:19,888 --> 00:09:22,356
That's disgusting. I'm okay.

216
00:09:23,326 --> 00:09:24,873
This is so your fault.

217
00:09:24,873 --> 00:09:26,420
How is this my fault?

218
00:09:26,462 --> 00:09:28,362
Carol never threw me out

219
00:09:28,362 --> 00:09:30,262
of a room before you.

220
00:09:30,366 --> 00:09:32,300
There's a lot of things

221
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,234
Carol never did before me.

222
00:09:34,437 --> 00:09:36,837
Are you trying to be clever?

223
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:39,237
You're so threatened by me.

224
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:41,305
Hey. Okay, all right.

225
00:09:41,305 --> 00:09:43,335
That's it. Get in here.

226
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:44,926
My God, you guys.

227
00:09:44,926 --> 00:09:46,473
I don't believe you.

228
00:09:47,283 --> 00:09:48,779
There are children

229
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:52,320
coming into the world here and your fighting isn't

230
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,254
the first thing they should hear.

231
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,370
So stop all the yelling!

232
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,450
Just stop it!

233
00:09:59,395 --> 00:10:01,846
Don't make me do this again!

234
00:10:01,846 --> 00:10:04,297
I don't like my voice like this!

235
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:11,397
Who wants to hear something ironic?

236
00:10:15,478 --> 00:10:17,469
Are they here yet?

237
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,326
Don't worry,

238
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:20,372
we're gonna find them.

239
00:10:20,416 --> 00:10:21,963
And until we do,

240
00:10:21,963 --> 00:10:23,510
we are all here for you. Okay?

241
00:10:25,421 --> 00:10:26,968
You were telling me

242
00:10:26,968 --> 00:10:28,515
about Paris. It sounds wonderful.

243
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,390
There was this great little

244
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,489
pastry shop right by my hotel--

245
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:36,293
There you go, dear.

246
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:38,897
You find them?

247
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:40,495
Not in the gift shop or cafeteria....

248
00:10:40,603 --> 00:10:43,299
Where are Phoebe and Joey?

249
00:10:43,506 --> 00:10:44,956
There's something sinister

250
00:10:44,956 --> 00:10:46,406
going on here.

251
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:48,460
If you find anyone,

252
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:54,506
or parts of anyone scream. And scream again.

253
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,936
Help!

254
00:10:58,936 --> 00:11:00,352
Come on!

255
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:02,323
I'm having a baby in there!

256
00:11:02,323 --> 00:11:04,257
Hello!

257
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,453
Okay, everyone stand back.

258
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:11,288
Ow.

259
00:11:12,368 --> 00:11:13,881
All right, good thing

260
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,394
we're in a hospital.

261
00:11:16,372 --> 00:11:18,363
Come on, Lydia, you can do it.

262
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:19,941
Push him out, push him out.

263
00:11:19,941 --> 00:11:21,408
Harder, harder.

264
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:23,290
Push him out, push him out.

265
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,302
Way out.

266
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,315
Let's get that ball and really move.

267
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:29,407
Let's get--

268
00:11:30,486 --> 00:11:32,903
I was just-- Yeah, okay.

269
00:11:32,903 --> 00:11:35,320
Push, push, push.

270
00:11:37,393 --> 00:11:38,843
What are you gonna do,

271
00:11:38,843 --> 00:11:40,293
suck the door open?

272
00:11:42,431 --> 00:11:45,298
Help! Help!

273
00:11:46,302 --> 00:11:48,298
And they found their bodies

274
00:11:48,298 --> 00:11:50,294
The very next day

275
00:11:50,406 --> 00:11:52,402
And they found their bodies

276
00:11:52,402 --> 00:11:54,398
The very next--

277
00:11:59,415 --> 00:12:01,349
Mom, everything's going fine.

278
00:12:01,383 --> 00:12:03,248
Ross is great.

279
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:05,550
He's in a whole other place.

280
00:12:06,388 --> 00:12:08,253
No, he's gone.

281
00:12:08,457 --> 00:12:09,970
No, you don't have to fly back.

282
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,483
Really.

283
00:12:12,261 --> 00:12:14,326
What do you mean ''This might be your

284
00:12:14,326 --> 00:12:16,391
only chance''? I'm only 26.

285
00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:18,433
I'm not even thinking

286
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:20,367
about babies yet.

287
00:12:32,481 --> 00:12:33,977
Where have you been?

288
00:12:33,977 --> 00:12:35,473
I just had a baby.

289
00:12:37,386 --> 00:12:38,478
Mazel tov.

290
00:12:43,392 --> 00:12:45,383
It could be one hour or three.

291
00:12:45,427 --> 00:12:46,456
But relax.

292
00:12:46,456 --> 00:12:47,485
She's doing great.

293
00:12:48,297 --> 00:12:50,362
So tell me, are you currently

294
00:12:50,362 --> 00:12:52,427
involved with anyone?

295
00:12:53,435 --> 00:12:56,529
Not at the moment, I'm not. Are you?

296
00:12:57,306 --> 00:12:58,819
No, it's hard enough to get women

297
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,332
to go out with me.

298
00:13:00,442 --> 00:13:02,410
Right. Yeah, I've heard that

299
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,378
about cute doctors.

300
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,364
No, really. I suppose it's because

301
00:13:07,364 --> 00:13:12,249
I spend so much time, you know where I do.

302
00:13:15,357 --> 00:13:16,853
I try not to let work

303
00:13:16,853 --> 00:13:18,349
affect my personal life.

304
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,877
But it's hard when, when you do

305
00:13:20,877 --> 00:13:23,294
what I do. It's, like....

306
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,479
Well, for instance,

307
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:25,559
what do you do?

308
00:13:26,302 --> 00:13:27,394
I'm a waitress.

309
00:13:28,504 --> 00:13:30,955
Aren't there times when you come home

310
00:13:30,955 --> 00:13:33,406
at night and you're, like:

311
00:13:33,475 --> 00:13:37,468
''If I see one more cup of coffee....''

312
00:13:42,418 --> 00:13:44,318
Gotcha.

313
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:46,482
I'm gonna check up on your friend.

314
00:13:46,482 --> 00:13:48,478
That's fine.

315
00:13:57,433 --> 00:13:58,946
How'd you know I was here?

316
00:13:58,946 --> 00:14:00,459
Your mom called me.

317
00:14:01,337 --> 00:14:03,328
So is this her?

318
00:14:03,372 --> 00:14:05,431
No, this is a loaner.

319
00:14:07,376 --> 00:14:09,537
Ours is at the shop.

320
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,543
God, I hope she has my brains.

321
00:14:14,383 --> 00:14:15,867
I'm sorry you had to do this

322
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:17,351
by yourself.

323
00:14:17,553 --> 00:14:20,021
I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor,

324
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:22,489
a nurse and a helper guy.

325
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:26,924
So did you see who won the game?

326
00:14:26,924 --> 00:14:29,455
The Knicks by 10. They suck.

327
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,461
They're not so bad.

328
00:14:56,492 --> 00:14:58,392
Come on. Come on.

329
00:14:58,494 --> 00:15:00,877
You're doing it too hard.

330
00:15:00,877 --> 00:15:03,260
You have to do it hard or else--

331
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:05,257
Damn it. Damn it.

332
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:06,413
Damn it, damn it.

333
00:15:06,413 --> 00:15:07,459
This is all your fault.

334
00:15:08,237 --> 00:15:09,300
This should be

335
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,363
the greatest day of my life.

336
00:15:10,472 --> 00:15:11,905
My son is being born,

337
00:15:11,905 --> 00:15:13,338
and I should be in there.

338
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,404
Instead, I'm stuck

339
00:15:14,404 --> 00:15:15,433
in a closet with you.

340
00:15:16,245 --> 00:15:17,758
I have been waiting for this

341
00:15:17,758 --> 00:15:19,271
as much as you.

342
00:15:19,381 --> 00:15:20,911
No one's been waiting

343
00:15:20,911 --> 00:15:22,441
for this as much as I have.

344
00:15:22,484 --> 00:15:24,281
You know what's funny?

345
00:15:24,353 --> 00:15:25,917
You go home with the baby.

346
00:15:25,917 --> 00:15:27,481
Where does that leave me?

347
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,382
You're his father.

348
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:31,454
Who am I? There's Father's Day.

349
00:15:31,454 --> 00:15:33,450
There's Mother's Day.

350
00:15:33,495 --> 00:15:36,293
There's no Lesbian Lover Day.

351
00:15:36,398 --> 00:15:38,491
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.

352
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,405
This is so great.

353
00:15:47,409 --> 00:15:49,468
Do you wanna explain that?

354
00:15:49,578 --> 00:15:51,426
I mean, when I was growing up,

355
00:15:51,426 --> 00:15:55,333
my dad left and my mother died

356
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:57,284
and my stepfather went to jail.

357
00:15:57,386 --> 00:15:58,916
I barely had enough pieces

358
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,446
to make one whole parent.

359
00:16:01,323 --> 00:16:02,870
And here's this baby who has

360
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,494
three whole parents who fight over

361
00:16:06,494 --> 00:16:11,256
who gets to love it the most and it's not even born yet.

362
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:13,350
It's just the luckiest baby

363
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,267
in the whole world.

364
00:16:17,239 --> 00:16:19,332
I'm sorry. You were fighting.

365
00:16:21,276 --> 00:16:22,436
Where are they?

366
00:16:22,544 --> 00:16:23,994
They'll be here.

367
00:16:23,994 --> 00:16:25,444
They wouldn't miss this.

368
00:16:26,248 --> 00:16:28,796
Relax. You're only at 9 centimeters,

369
00:16:28,796 --> 00:16:31,344
and the baby's at zero station.

370
00:16:34,356 --> 00:16:36,290
You are really frightening me.

371
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,924
Somebody wanna help me?

372
00:16:39,924 --> 00:16:41,488
Trying to rip out my heart.

373
00:16:43,265 --> 00:16:44,328
That's great.

374
00:16:44,328 --> 00:16:45,391
Anybody seen a nipple?

375
00:16:47,503 --> 00:16:48,885
Ten centimeters.

376
00:16:48,885 --> 00:16:50,267
Here we go.

377
00:16:50,305 --> 00:16:51,835
Time to start pushing.

378
00:16:51,835 --> 00:16:53,365
But they're not here yet.

379
00:16:53,475 --> 00:16:55,875
I can't tell the baby to wait.

380
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,275
Oh, God.

381
00:17:02,351 --> 00:17:03,847
Okay, got the vent open.

382
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:05,343
Hi, I'm Ben.

383
00:17:07,322 --> 00:17:09,415
I'm hospital worker Ben.

384
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:12,226
It's Ben to the rescue.

385
00:17:14,463 --> 00:17:17,432
Ben, you ready? Give me your foot.

386
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:19,848
On three, Ben.

387
00:17:19,848 --> 00:17:21,463
One, two, three.

388
00:17:22,337 --> 00:17:23,850
Come on, Ben.

389
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:25,363
That's it, Ben.

390
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:27,467
What do you see?

391
00:17:28,544 --> 00:17:30,392
I see what appears to be

392
00:17:30,392 --> 00:17:32,240
a dark vent.

393
00:17:32,314 --> 00:17:33,338
Wait.

394
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:36,441
Yes, it is, in fact, a dark vent.

395
00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:41,335
Pheebs, it's open.

396
00:17:41,335 --> 00:17:42,381
It's open.

397
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,454
Wait. You forgot your legs.

398
00:17:49,398 --> 00:17:50,928
Push. Push.

399
00:17:50,928 --> 00:17:52,458
We're here. We're here.

400
00:17:54,269 --> 00:17:55,395
Where have you been?

401
00:17:56,405 --> 00:17:57,463
Long story.

402
00:17:57,506 --> 00:18:00,390
I need you to keep pushing.

403
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:03,274
I need-- Excuse me, can I have this?

404
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:06,275
There's too many people here.

405
00:18:06,275 --> 00:18:08,271
There's about to be one more.

406
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:10,885
So if you're not an ex-husband or

407
00:18:10,885 --> 00:18:13,353
lesbian life partner, out you go.

408
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:16,270
Bye-bye.

409
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,316
Good luck, you guys.

410
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:19,338
Do you have to be

411
00:18:19,338 --> 00:18:21,317
Carol's lesbian life partner?

412
00:18:21,363 --> 00:18:22,421
Out.

413
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:26,323
Here he comes.

414
00:18:26,435 --> 00:18:29,336
Let me see. I've gotta see.

415
00:18:33,475 --> 00:18:35,238
A head.

416
00:18:35,444 --> 00:18:36,843
It's huge.

417
00:18:36,843 --> 00:18:38,242
How are you doing this?

418
00:18:39,348 --> 00:18:41,339
You're not helping.

419
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,350
You're doing great.

420
00:18:43,452 --> 00:18:44,419
Hello?

421
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:45,386
Oh, sorry.

422
00:18:45,454 --> 00:18:46,449
What do you see?

423
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:47,444
What do you see?

424
00:18:48,257 --> 00:18:50,805
We got a head. We got arms.

425
00:18:50,805 --> 00:18:53,353
Oh, look at the little fingers.

426
00:18:53,495 --> 00:18:59,365
A chest and a stomach and it's a boy, definitely a boy.

427
00:18:59,468 --> 00:19:01,402
Legs, knees and feet.

428
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,234
He's here.

429
00:19:10,412 --> 00:19:12,437
He's a person.

430
00:19:13,315 --> 00:19:14,310
Look.

431
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,305
What does he look like?

432
00:19:16,218 --> 00:19:17,765
Kind of like my Uncle Ed,

433
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:19,312
covered in Jell-O.

434
00:19:20,322 --> 00:19:21,414
Really?

435
00:19:22,257 --> 00:19:24,316
You guys, he's beautiful.

436
00:19:24,426 --> 00:19:26,326
Thanks, Pheebs.

437
00:19:32,367 --> 00:19:34,801
No shouting, but we still need

438
00:19:34,801 --> 00:19:37,235
a name for this little guy.

439
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,236
How about Ben?

440
00:19:40,236 --> 00:19:42,232
I like Ben.

441
00:19:42,444 --> 00:19:43,536
Ben.

442
00:19:48,283 --> 00:19:49,830
Ben's good. How come you never

443
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,377
mentioned Ben before?

444
00:19:51,486 --> 00:19:54,353
We just cooked it up.

445
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,381
That's what we were off doing.

446
00:20:00,462 --> 00:20:01,878
Can we come in?

447
00:20:01,878 --> 00:20:03,294
Yeah, come on.

448
00:20:10,405 --> 00:20:12,305
I know. I know.

449
00:20:12,374 --> 00:20:13,921
Everybody, there's someone

450
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,468
I'd like you to meet.

451
00:20:16,411 --> 00:20:17,861
This is Ben.

452
00:20:17,861 --> 00:20:19,311
Hi, Ben.

453
00:20:19,381 --> 00:20:21,315
Ben, this is everybody.

454
00:20:22,384 --> 00:20:24,477
Susan, he looks just like you.

455
00:20:27,489 --> 00:20:28,513
Thanks.

456
00:20:29,391 --> 00:20:30,938
I can't believe one of us

457
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,485
actually has one of these.

458
00:20:33,295 --> 00:20:34,341
I know.

459
00:20:34,341 --> 00:20:35,387
I still am one of these.

460
00:20:39,401 --> 00:20:40,493
Can I?

461
00:20:42,437 --> 00:20:45,429
Okay, the head. You gotta....

462
00:20:54,316 --> 00:20:55,413
I'm your Aunt Monica.

463
00:20:55,413 --> 00:20:56,510
Yes, I am.

464
00:20:57,319 --> 00:20:59,310
I'm your Aunt Monica.

465
00:21:04,459 --> 00:21:06,359
I will always have gum.

466
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,866
Ben I want you to know that

467
00:21:14,866 --> 00:21:20,469
there may be some times when I may not be around like this.

468
00:21:23,412 --> 00:21:29,282
But I'll still always come back...like this.

469
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:31,917
And sometimes,

470
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:35,415
I may be away longer like this.

471
00:21:39,394 --> 00:21:46,333
But I'll still always come back...like this.

472
00:21:47,402 --> 00:21:49,950
And sometimes, I'll want you to steal

473
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,498
third and I'll go like this:

474
00:22:01,283 --> 00:22:03,251
He is so amazing.

475
00:22:03,352 --> 00:22:05,479
Yeah, I know. Look at him.

476
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,956
Nothing.

477
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,452
I don't think that's his name.

478
00:22:16,298 --> 00:22:18,459
Look, he's closing his eyes.

479
00:22:19,401 --> 00:22:22,268
Look, he's opening his eyes.

480
00:22:24,406 --> 00:22:26,397
He doesn't do much, does he?

481
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:29,368
Nope, this is pretty much it.

482
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:39,480
You guys wanna get some coffee?

483
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:42,586
I'll see you guys later.

484
00:23:16,258 --> 00:23:18,351
He's closing his eyes again.
