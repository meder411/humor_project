1
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:08,971
These were expensive,

2
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:12,775
and he'll grow out of them in, like, 20 minutes,

4
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:14,288
but I couldn't resist.

5
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:19,360
Look at these.

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,371
Hey, Ben. ''Just do it.''

7
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:25,499
Oh, my God.

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,840
Was that too much

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,370
pressure for him?

10
00:00:29,514 --> 00:00:31,510
Wow, is he hungry already?

11
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,506
I guess so.

12
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:35,478
You know, it's--

13
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,389
Something funny about sneakers.

14
00:00:40,389 --> 00:00:42,289
I'll be right back.

15
00:00:43,294 --> 00:00:44,488
I gotta get one too.

16
00:00:47,432 --> 00:00:49,400
Hey, what are you guys doing?

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,967
We're just hanging out

18
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,434
by the spoons.

19
00:00:52,537 --> 00:00:54,300
Ladle?

20
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:56,418
Will you grow up? This is the

21
00:00:56,418 --> 00:00:58,431
most beautiful thing in the world.

22
00:00:58,543 --> 00:00:59,993
We know.

23
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:01,443
But there's a baby sucking on it.

24
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:06,796
This is my son having lunch, okay?

25
00:01:06,796 --> 00:01:09,344
It'll happen a lot so get used to it.

26
00:01:09,387 --> 00:01:11,918
If you're uncomfortable, just ask

27
00:01:11,918 --> 00:01:14,449
questions. Carol's fine with it.

28
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:18,928
Carol?

29
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:20,361
Carol?

30
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:24,367
I was just wondering if Joey could ask

31
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:27,268
you a question about breast-feeding?

32
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:29,268
Sure.

33
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:32,467
Does it hurt?

34
00:01:34,278 --> 00:01:36,371
It did at first, but not anymore.

35
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:37,503
Chandler?

36
00:01:39,484 --> 00:01:42,476
So how often can you do it?

37
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:44,513
As much as he needs.

38
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,391
Okay, I got one, I got one.

39
00:01:50,394 --> 00:01:52,345
If he blows into one, does

40
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,296
the other one get bigger?

41
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,280
Do you have muffins left?

42
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:45,896
Yeah, I forget which ones.

43
00:02:45,896 --> 00:02:47,477
You're busy. I'll get it.

44
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:49,001
Anyone else want one?

45
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:50,417
No, thanks.

46
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:52,785
You're losing your apron.

47
00:02:52,785 --> 00:02:54,281
Let me get it.

48
00:02:54,392 --> 00:02:55,359
There you go.

49
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:56,326
Thank you.

50
00:02:58,296 --> 00:02:59,490
What a bitch!

51
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:04,366
I have a friend at

52
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:08,430
Bloomingdale's who's quitting and wants to abuse his discount.

54
00:03:08,472 --> 00:03:09,854
Want to come

55
00:03:09,854 --> 00:03:11,236
take advantage of it?

56
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,326
Oh, I can't. I have to take my

57
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,277
grandmother to the vet.

58
00:03:18,482 --> 00:03:19,466
I'll go with you.

59
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:20,450
Great.

60
00:03:23,354 --> 00:03:24,304
Hi, honey.

61
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,254
Hey, sweetums.

62
00:03:26,357 --> 00:03:28,382
And hello to the rest.

63
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:33,361
Monica, you can't go shopping

64
00:03:33,361 --> 00:03:35,460
with her. What about Rachel?

65
00:03:35,499 --> 00:03:37,433
Will it be a problem?

66
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:39,367
Bloomingdale's with Julie?

67
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,438
It's like cheating on Rachel

68
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:43,406
in her house of worship.

69
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:46,376
Monica, she will kill you.

70
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:49,429
She will kill you

71
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,380
like a dog in the street!

72
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,900
Jules tells me you guys

73
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,481
are going shopping tomorrow.

74
00:03:59,423 --> 00:04:01,874
It's actually not that big a deal--

75
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,325
It is to me. This is great.

76
00:04:04,428 --> 00:04:06,419
I really appreciate this.

77
00:04:06,464 --> 00:04:08,329
You're welcome.

78
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:24,339
Bijan for men?

79
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:27,246
Bijan for men?

80
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,545
Bijan for men?

81
00:04:30,454 --> 00:04:31,404
Hey, Annabel.

82
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:32,354
Hey, Joey.

83
00:04:32,456 --> 00:04:33,468
You hear about the new guy?

84
00:04:33,468 --> 00:04:34,480
Who?

85
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:37,841
Nobody knows his name. Me and

86
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:40,389
the girls call him ''the Hombre Man.''

87
00:04:49,273 --> 00:04:50,365
Hombre?

88
00:04:55,313 --> 00:04:57,372
What's he doing in my section?

89
00:04:57,481 --> 00:04:59,346
I guess he doesn't know.

90
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:01,211
Well, he's gonna.

91
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,221
I'll see you a little later, okay?

92
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:09,325
Hey, how you doing?

93
00:05:09,427 --> 00:05:11,327
Mornin'.

94
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:14,297
Listen, I know you're new but it's

95
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:18,815
understood that everything from young men's to

97
00:05:18,815 --> 00:05:20,362
the escalator is my territory.

98
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,331
Your territory?

99
00:05:25,443 --> 00:05:26,393
Bijan for men?

100
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:27,343
No, thanks.

101
00:05:27,445 --> 00:05:29,242
Hombre?

102
00:05:29,347 --> 00:05:31,474
Yeah, all right.

103
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:40,280
You were saying?

104
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:45,329
Listen. You were with me,

105
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:47,297
and we were shopping all day.

106
00:05:47,398 --> 00:05:48,427
What?

107
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:49,456
We shopped and had lunch.

108
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,461
All right. What did I have?

109
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,282
You had a salad.

110
00:05:54,282 --> 00:05:56,295
No wonder I don't feel full.

111
00:05:56,374 --> 00:05:57,398
Hi! What's up?

112
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,402
We went shopping, and I had a salad.

113
00:06:03,214 --> 00:06:04,226
Good, Pheebs.

114
00:06:04,226 --> 00:06:05,238
What'd you buy?

115
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:09,215
We went shopping for....

116
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,409
For....

117
00:06:11,255 --> 00:06:13,314
For fur.

118
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:18,226
You went shopping for fur?

119
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,328
And then I realized that I'm against

120
00:06:22,328 --> 00:06:25,326
that. So then we bought some....

121
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:27,533
Boobs.

122
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,468
You bought boobs?

123
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:39,375
Bras!

124
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:41,375
We bought bras!

125
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:44,445
We bought bras.

126
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,288
Bijan for men?

127
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,360
Bijan for men?

128
00:06:51,395 --> 00:06:52,555
Bijan for--

129
00:06:54,398 --> 00:06:55,558
Hey, Annabel.

130
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:58,380
I was wondering if, after work,

131
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,393
we could grab a cup of coffee?

132
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:04,235
Actually, I sort of have plans.

133
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:09,439
You ready, Annabel?

134
00:07:11,248 --> 00:07:12,408
You bet.

135
00:07:14,318 --> 00:07:16,445
Maybe some other time.

136
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,326
Not the first time I lost a girl

137
00:07:28,326 --> 00:07:30,322
to a cowboy spraying cologne.

138
00:07:30,434 --> 00:07:32,265
Bijan for men?

139
00:07:32,436 --> 00:07:34,267
Bijan for men!

140
00:07:35,473 --> 00:07:37,441
Okay, this is Funny Clown.

141
00:07:37,475 --> 00:07:39,409
It's for after his naps,

142
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:41,343
not before or he won't sleep.

143
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:43,345
We've been through this before.

144
00:07:43,345 --> 00:07:45,245
We have a good time.

145
00:07:45,282 --> 00:07:47,330
We laugh, we play.

146
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,378
It's like we're father and son.

147
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:51,850
Honey, relax.

148
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,346
Ross is great with him.

149
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:55,453
Don't look so surprised.

150
00:07:55,453 --> 00:07:57,449
I'm a lovely person.

151
00:07:59,463 --> 00:08:01,294
This is so cute.

152
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,229
I got that for him.

153
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:05,199
''My Mommies Love Me.''

154
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:10,434
That's clever.

155
00:08:11,442 --> 00:08:12,431
Hello.

156
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:14,438
Oh, hi, Jul--

157
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:17,407
Hi, Jew!

158
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,443
Okay, sure.

159
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:25,771
That'd be great.

160
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:27,221
See you then. Bye.

161
00:08:27,358 --> 00:08:29,349
Did you just say, ''Hi, Jew''?

162
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:36,233
Yes, yes, I did.

163
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,427
That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz.

164
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,838
He's going through

165
00:08:44,838 --> 00:08:46,436
this whole religious thing.

166
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,977
Yeah, he likes it.

167
00:08:47,977 --> 00:08:49,444
Reaffirms his faith.

168
00:08:55,286 --> 00:08:57,345
Ben, dinner!

169
00:08:58,289 --> 00:08:59,381
Thanks, Aunt Pheebs.

170
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,373
Did you microwave it?

171
00:09:01,373 --> 00:09:03,290
You can't do that to breast milk.

172
00:09:03,394 --> 00:09:04,907
I think I know how

173
00:09:04,907 --> 00:09:06,420
to heat breast milk.

174
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:12,293
What did you just do?

175
00:09:12,403 --> 00:09:14,303
I licked my arm. What?

176
00:09:14,338 --> 00:09:16,289
It's breast milk!

177
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,240
So?

178
00:09:18,342 --> 00:09:19,872
Phoebe, that is juice

179
00:09:19,872 --> 00:09:21,402
squeezed from a person.

180
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:25,305
What is the big deal?

181
00:09:27,351 --> 00:09:29,319
What did you just do?

182
00:09:31,422 --> 00:09:32,935
Okay, can people stop

183
00:09:32,935 --> 00:09:34,448
drinking the breast milk?

184
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:37,794
You won't even taste it?

185
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:39,261
No!

186
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,421
Even if you pretend it's milk?

187
00:09:42,232 --> 00:09:44,280
Not even if Carol's breast had

188
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,328
a picture of a missing child on it.

189
00:09:53,477 --> 00:09:55,411
Where is everyone?

190
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,345
At the park. Where have you been?

191
00:09:57,481 --> 00:09:58,470
Just out.

192
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:01,297
Had some lunch. Just me.

193
00:10:01,297 --> 00:10:03,345
A little quality time with me.

194
00:10:04,455 --> 00:10:05,501
Thanks for the jacket.

195
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:06,547
No problem.

196
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,384
You can borrow it, by the way.

197
00:10:10,461 --> 00:10:13,294
Oh, here are your keys, honey.

198
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,880
If you were at lunch alone,

199
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,360
how come it cost you $53?

200
00:10:23,474 --> 00:10:26,272
You know what probably happened?

201
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:27,873
Someone must have

202
00:10:27,873 --> 00:10:29,369
stolen my credit card.

203
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,445
And sort of just put the

204
00:10:31,445 --> 00:10:33,310
receipt in your pocket?

205
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:35,433
That is an excellent,

206
00:10:35,433 --> 00:10:36,582
excellent question.

207
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:38,413
That is excellent.

208
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,405
What's with you?

209
00:10:41,405 --> 00:10:42,520
Who did you have lunch with?

210
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,856
Judy.

211
00:10:43,856 --> 00:10:44,385
Who?

212
00:10:44,495 --> 00:10:44,961
Julie.

213
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:45,427
What?

214
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:47,326
Jody.

215
00:10:48,532 --> 00:10:50,329
You were with Julie?

216
00:10:51,502 --> 00:10:53,419
When it started, I was just

217
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,873
trying to be nice to her because she was

219
00:10:56,873 --> 00:10:58,340
my brother's girlfriend.

220
00:10:58,409 --> 00:10:59,922
And then one thing

221
00:10:59,922 --> 00:11:07,283
led to another and before I knew it, we were shopping.

224
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:12,387
Oh, my God.

225
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:17,483
Honey, wait. We only did it once.

226
00:11:18,495 --> 00:11:21,464
It didn't mean anything to me.

227
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:25,432
Rachel, I was thinking

228
00:11:25,432 --> 00:11:27,297
of you the whole time.

229
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:31,889
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

230
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:34,272
I never meant for you to find out.

231
00:11:34,311 --> 00:11:35,909
Oh, please! Please!

232
00:11:35,909 --> 00:11:37,507
You wanted to get caught!

233
00:11:38,382 --> 00:11:39,474
That is not true!

234
00:11:39,516 --> 00:11:40,915
You just happen

235
00:11:40,915 --> 00:11:42,314
to leave it in here?

236
00:11:43,387 --> 00:11:45,435
Did it ever occur to you

237
00:11:45,435 --> 00:11:47,483
that I might just be that stupid?

238
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:50,840
Okay, Monica. I just have

239
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,387
to know one thing.

240
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:57,529
Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?

241
00:12:11,248 --> 00:12:13,261
Okay, I just really need

242
00:12:13,261 --> 00:12:15,274
to not be with you right now.

243
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:27,385
Hi, who's this?

244
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:29,432
Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working?

245
00:12:29,432 --> 00:12:31,366
It's Monica.

246
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:34,362
Yes, I know I did a horrible thing.

247
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:35,938
Joanne, it's not

248
00:12:35,938 --> 00:12:37,371
as simple as all that.

249
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:40,943
No, I don't care what Steve thinks.

250
00:12:40,943 --> 00:12:43,377
Hi, Steve.

251
00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:49,376
How did we do?

252
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:50,869
I tasted Ben's milk,

253
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:52,319
and Ross freaked out.

254
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,314
I did not freak out.

255
00:12:54,424 --> 00:12:56,403
Why'd you freak out?

256
00:12:56,403 --> 00:12:58,382
Because it's breast milk.

257
00:12:59,296 --> 00:13:00,780
It's gross.

258
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,264
My breast milk is gross?

259
00:13:04,268 --> 00:13:05,462
This should be fun.

260
00:13:08,238 --> 00:13:10,786
There's nothing wrong with it. I just

261
00:13:10,786 --> 00:13:13,334
don't think breast milk is for adults.

262
00:13:13,443 --> 00:13:15,894
Of course, the packaging does

263
00:13:15,894 --> 00:13:18,345
appeal to grownups and kids alike.

264
00:13:19,349 --> 00:13:22,301
Don't be silly. I've tried it. It's no

265
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,253
big deal. Come on, just taste it.

266
00:13:25,355 --> 00:13:27,346
That would be no.

267
00:13:28,258 --> 00:13:29,253
Come on. Try it.

268
00:13:29,253 --> 00:13:30,248
It's natural.

269
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,452
It doesn't taste bad.

270
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:33,029
It tastes kind of sweet.

271
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:34,496
Sort of like....

272
00:13:35,265 --> 00:13:36,260
Like what?

273
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,255
Cantaloupe juice.

274
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:38,493
Exactly.

275
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:47,373
You've tasted it.

276
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:49,472
You've tasted it.

277
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:53,483
Oh, you've tasted it.

278
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,919
You can keep saying it,

279
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,319
but it won't stop being true.

280
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,455
Give me the bottle.

281
00:14:14,238 --> 00:14:15,330
Get me the towel.

282
00:14:40,397 --> 00:14:41,364
Howdy.

283
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,491
Give me a box of juice.

284
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:50,398
They switched me over to Hombre.

285
00:14:50,574 --> 00:14:52,439
Well, maybe it's because of

286
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:54,304
the way you're dressed.

287
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,327
Or maybe this guy's so good

288
00:14:57,327 --> 00:14:59,375
they want to put more people on it.

289
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:00,866
This guy goes through

290
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,316
two bottles a day now.

291
00:15:04,421 --> 00:15:06,252
What do you care?

292
00:15:07,224 --> 00:15:08,737
You're an actor.

293
00:15:08,737 --> 00:15:10,250
This is a day job. It's nothing.

294
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,521
I know, but I was the best.

295
00:15:13,263 --> 00:15:16,323
You know? I liked being the best.

296
00:15:20,437 --> 00:15:22,462
Maybe I should get out of the game.

297
00:15:23,273 --> 00:15:24,854
They need guys up in housewares

298
00:15:24,854 --> 00:15:26,435
to serve cheese.

299
00:15:26,543 --> 00:15:28,238
Say you do that.

300
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:30,758
Sooner or later, someone will come

301
00:15:30,758 --> 00:15:33,238
along that slices a better cheddar.

302
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:35,818
Then where you gonna run?

303
00:15:35,818 --> 00:15:37,285
You're right.

304
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:38,952
Show him what you're made of.

305
00:15:38,952 --> 00:15:40,550
Stand your ground.

306
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:43,373
Show him that you're the baddest

307
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:45,455
hombre west of the lingerie!

308
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:47,358
I'm gonna do it!

309
00:15:47,358 --> 00:15:48,353
All right!

310
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:51,514
Now, go see Miss Kitty and

311
00:15:51,514 --> 00:15:53,562
she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.

312
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,272
I don't know what to say.

313
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,791
Good, because I'm not listening.

314
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,208
I feel terrible. I really do.

315
00:16:02,312 --> 00:16:04,263
I'm sorry. Did my back

316
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,214
hurt your knife?

317
00:16:07,451 --> 00:16:09,430
Say that I'm friends with her.

318
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,409
Is that so terrible?

319
00:16:12,422 --> 00:16:13,838
It's that terrible?

320
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:15,254
You don't get it!

321
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,441
It's bad enough she stole the guy

322
00:16:17,441 --> 00:16:19,523
who I'm supposed to be with.

323
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:24,331
But now...she's actually....

325
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:27,462
But now she's actually stealing you.

326
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:33,841
What are you talking about?

327
00:16:33,841 --> 00:16:36,241
Nobody could steal me from you.

328
00:16:36,346 --> 00:16:38,860
Because I'm friends with her doesn't

329
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,374
make me any less friends with you.

330
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:43,445
I mean, you're my....

331
00:16:45,355 --> 00:16:46,447
And we're....

332
00:16:49,493 --> 00:16:50,977
Oh, I love you!

333
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:52,461
I love you too!

334
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,751
You guys, I know that this really

335
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:02,202
doesn't have anything to do with me.

336
00:17:02,305 --> 00:17:03,431
But I love you guys too!

337
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:12,210
I really needed that.

338
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,930
Look, I know right now

339
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,410
you really need to hate Julie's guts.

340
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:21,424
But she didn't do anything wrong.

341
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:24,304
She's just a girl who met a guy,

342
00:17:24,304 --> 00:17:26,283
and now they go out.

343
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,346
And I really think that if you

344
00:17:29,346 --> 00:17:31,462
gave her a chance, you'd like her.

345
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:34,462
Will you just give that a chance?

346
00:17:35,238 --> 00:17:36,296
For me?

347
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:39,858
I'd do anything for you.

348
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,274
You know that!

349
00:17:41,344 --> 00:17:43,471
I'd do anything for you!

350
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:46,348
Wait, wait, wait!

351
00:18:05,235 --> 00:18:06,395
Mornin'.

352
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:11,239
I said, mornin'!

353
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:13,501
I heard you.

354
00:18:15,312 --> 00:18:16,825
All right, everybody.

355
00:18:16,825 --> 00:18:18,338
I'm opening the doors.

356
00:18:19,216 --> 00:18:20,240
You boys ready?

357
00:18:25,455 --> 00:18:26,939
Ready.

358
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,423
Yeah, I'm ready.

359
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:17,398
You idiot! You stupid cowboy!

360
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,225
You've blinded me!

361
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:20,209
I'm suing!

362
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,438
Oh, my God! Todd!

363
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,794
What the hell did you do?

364
00:19:25,794 --> 00:19:28,342
I'm sorry. I'm such a doofus!

365
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,252
My God, what happened?

366
00:19:32,355 --> 00:19:34,414
These new kids, they never last.

367
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:39,456
Sooner or later they all stop lasting.

369
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,811
What do you say I buy you

370
00:19:42,811 --> 00:19:44,358
that cup of coffee now?

371
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:46,326
Sure.

372
00:19:58,481 --> 00:19:59,965
So.

373
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,449
So.

374
00:20:05,355 --> 00:20:07,903
I just thought we should hang out.

375
00:20:07,903 --> 00:20:10,451
I mean, we've never really talked.

376
00:20:10,493 --> 00:20:12,376
You'd know that,

377
00:20:12,376 --> 00:20:14,259
being one of the two of us.

378
00:20:14,364 --> 00:20:15,456
I know.

379
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:17,929
I probably shouldn't

380
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:21,766
say this, but I'm pretty much totally

382
00:20:21,766 --> 00:20:23,262
intimidated by you.

383
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:25,274
Really?

384
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,364
Me?

385
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,410
Oh, my God, are you kidding?

386
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:31,008
Ross is crazy about you, and I really

387
00:20:31,008 --> 00:20:33,505
wanted you to like me, and I....

388
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:35,801
It's probably me

389
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:38,901
being totally paranoid but I kind of got the feeling

391
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:40,482
that maybe you don't.

392
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:53,393
Well you're not totally paranoid.

394
00:21:01,278 --> 00:21:02,267
Oh, God.

395
00:21:04,447 --> 00:21:06,347
When you and Ross

396
00:21:06,347 --> 00:21:10,480
first started going out it was really hard for me.

398
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:14,937
For many reasons, of which

399
00:21:14,937 --> 00:21:17,485
I'm not gonna bore you with now.

400
00:21:21,464 --> 00:21:23,961
I just see how happy he is

401
00:21:23,961 --> 00:21:26,458
and how good you guys are together.

402
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,366
And Monica's always

403
00:21:29,366 --> 00:21:32,858
saying how nice you are and God, I hate it when

405
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,308
she's right!

406
00:21:35,512 --> 00:21:37,377
Thanks.

407
00:21:37,514 --> 00:21:39,465
Would you like to go to

408
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,416
a movie sometime or something?

409
00:21:41,518 --> 00:21:43,002
Yeah, that'd be great.

410
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:44,486
I'd love it.

411
00:21:44,521 --> 00:21:46,421
I'd love it too.

412
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,582
Shoot, I gotta go.

413
00:21:49,326 --> 00:21:50,907
So I'll talk to you later.

414
00:21:50,907 --> 00:21:52,488
All right, Julie.

415
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,330
What a manipulative bitch.

416
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:35,403
It's not bad.
