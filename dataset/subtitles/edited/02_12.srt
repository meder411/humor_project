1
00:00:09,298 --> 00:00:12,290
Can't get the monkey off your back?

2
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:16,403
Then put it in your mouth  with Monkeyshine Beer.

3
00:00:16,505 --> 00:00:19,338
Get it, monkey

4
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:22,343
Get it, get it, monkey

5
00:00:24,413 --> 00:00:25,505
Monkey, monkey

6
00:00:25,614 --> 00:00:27,411
Monkeyshine Beer.

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,509
'Cause it's a jungle out there.

8
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:32,446
That commercial always makes me sad.

9
00:00:32,555 --> 00:00:34,438
But the guy opens his beer,

10
00:00:34,438 --> 00:00:38,359
the girls run at him so everything works out okay.

11
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:40,045
I meant,

12
00:00:40,045 --> 00:00:41,529
the monkey reminds me of Marcel.

13
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:43,320
I can see that.

14
00:00:43,365 --> 00:00:45,845
Because they both have those big

15
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:48,325
brown eyes and the little pouty chin.

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,467
And the fact that

17
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:50,564
they're both monkeys?

18
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,007
Did I do the right thing,

19
00:00:53,007 --> 00:00:54,474
giving him away?

20
00:00:54,543 --> 00:00:56,539
Ross, you had to.

21
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:58,535
He was humping everything in sight.

22
00:00:59,348 --> 00:01:00,929
My Malibu Barbie won't

23
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:02,510
be wearing white to her wedding.

24
00:01:05,354 --> 00:01:10,303
Remember when he'd borrow your hat and when you got it back,

25
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:12,316
there'd be monkey raisins in it?

26
00:01:13,395 --> 00:01:14,419
He loved that joke.

27
00:01:14,497 --> 00:01:16,465
When he did it, it was funny.

28
00:01:16,465 --> 00:01:20,998
When I did it to my boss...suddenly I had this big

29
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:22,494
attitude problem.

30
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,383
Hey, check it out.

31
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:13,446
Guess what I got?

32
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:15,285
Rhythm?

33
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:18,316
No. My first fan mail.

34
00:02:20,396 --> 00:02:21,522
''Dear Dr. Ramoray:

35
00:02:22,298 --> 00:02:23,845
I love you and would do

36
00:02:23,845 --> 00:02:25,392
anything to have you.''

37
00:02:25,434 --> 00:02:27,368
My gosh. ''Your not-so-secret

38
00:02:27,368 --> 00:02:29,302
admirer, Erika Ford.''

39
00:02:30,306 --> 00:02:31,295
Oh, wait.

40
00:02:31,407 --> 00:02:33,472
''P.S. Enclosed, please find

41
00:02:33,472 --> 00:02:35,537
1 4 of my eyelashes.''

42
00:02:37,413 --> 00:02:38,909
In Crazy World, that means

43
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,405
you're married.

44
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:45,002
It's not addressed to Days of our

45
00:02:45,002 --> 00:02:47,453
Lives. It came to your apartment.

46
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:49,019
She was in our building.

47
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:50,515
Oh, my God.

48
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,428
I got my very own stalker.

49
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:57,448
You're so lucky.

50
00:02:57,448 --> 00:02:59,365
I have to share with guys at work.

51
00:03:00,502 --> 00:03:03,403
Remember we talked about ''good thing,

52
00:03:03,403 --> 00:03:06,304
bad thing''? This is a bad thing.

53
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:08,271
Hey, guys.

54
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,266
Hey.

55
00:03:09,378 --> 00:03:10,504
Where are you off to?

56
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,377
There's a paleontology

57
00:03:12,377 --> 00:03:13,474
conference in L.A.

58
00:03:14,283 --> 00:03:16,279
I figured I'd go, drive down

59
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,275
to the zoo and surprise Marcel.

60
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,368
He will be surprised.

61
00:03:20,368 --> 00:03:25,519
Till he realizes he's a monkey and isn't capable of that emotion.

62
00:03:28,297 --> 00:03:29,394
Phoebe?

63
00:03:29,394 --> 00:03:30,491
That cute guy is here again.

64
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:35,016
Okay, so everyone pretend I'm telling a story.

65
00:03:35,016 --> 00:03:36,597
It's really funny.

66
00:03:37,339 --> 00:03:38,334
So everyone just laugh.

67
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:39,329
Now!

68
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:42,409
I know, I know.

69
00:03:43,412 --> 00:03:44,509
Hello.

70
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:45,606
Hi.

71
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:47,428
I'm Rob Donnen.

72
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:48,508
Hi, Rob Donnen.

73
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,933
I don't know a thing about music

74
00:03:50,933 --> 00:03:53,316
but I think you're great.

75
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:55,514
Oh! Wow.

76
00:03:55,557 --> 00:03:57,553
Anyway, I schedule performers

77
00:03:57,553 --> 00:03:59,549
for children's libraries.

78
00:04:00,296 --> 00:04:02,378
I was thinking, have you thought

79
00:04:02,378 --> 00:04:04,460
about playing your songs for kids?

80
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:12,423
I would love to have kids...hear me play the songs

81
00:04:12,423 --> 00:04:14,374
that I will write for them.

82
00:04:16,378 --> 00:04:18,278
What'll we do for dinner?

83
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,371
We could cook for ourselves.

84
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:27,351
Hello.

85
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,380
-It's Erika.

86
00:04:28,524 --> 00:04:30,321
My God. The stalker!

87
00:04:30,426 --> 00:04:31,484
It's open.

88
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,410
Hit her with a frying pan.

89
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,490
Good idea.

90
00:04:36,532 --> 00:04:38,511
But we want a backup plan,

91
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,490
in case she isn't a cartoon.

92
00:04:42,304 --> 00:04:43,498
Let's get out of here.

93
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:48,533
The one time they're not home.

94
00:04:50,412 --> 00:04:52,880
We'll leave. When we pass her, she

95
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,348
won't know it's me. We've never met.

96
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,468
That's how radio stars

97
00:04:58,468 --> 00:04:59,617
escape stalkers.

98
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,450
She's coming.

99
00:05:08,464 --> 00:05:10,261
It's me.

100
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:11,933
This is it.

101
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:13,400
This is how we're gonna die.

102
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,394
You ready?

103
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:17,363
Wait, wait, wait.

104
00:05:26,315 --> 00:05:27,373
Erika!

105
00:05:37,426 --> 00:05:38,358
Mr. Geller?

106
00:05:38,358 --> 00:05:39,290
Yes, hi.

107
00:05:39,395 --> 00:05:41,522
Dean Lipson, zoo administrator.

108
00:05:42,331 --> 00:05:43,525
You had a question?

109
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:45,929
I can't find the monkey

110
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,425
I donated last year.

111
00:05:47,503 --> 00:05:48,999
He's a capuchin,

112
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:50,495
answers to the name Marcel?

113
00:05:51,407 --> 00:05:54,399
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

114
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,603
Marcel has passed on.

115
00:05:58,514 --> 00:06:01,347
Oh, my God! What happened?

116
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,866
He got sick,

117
00:06:02,866 --> 00:06:06,344
and then he got sicker then he got a little better.

118
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:08,382
But then he died.

119
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,386
I can't believe this.

120
00:06:12,494 --> 00:06:14,945
I'm sorry, Mr. Geller.

121
00:06:14,945 --> 00:06:17,396
But you know, there's an old saying:

122
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:20,366
''Sometimes monkeys die.''

123
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:27,468
It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.

124
00:06:28,277 --> 00:06:29,392
Someone should've called me.

125
00:06:29,392 --> 00:06:30,507
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,794
Look, I know this can't bring him

127
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:36,308
back, but here. It's just a gesture.

128
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,316
Zoo dollars?

129
00:06:39,421 --> 00:06:41,451
Yes, and come see the bird show at 4.

130
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:43,481
The macaws wear hats.

131
00:06:45,394 --> 00:06:46,890
It's cuter if your monkey

132
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,386
hasn't just died.

133
00:06:57,339 --> 00:06:58,431
I know.

134
00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:01,942
I can't believe Joey's having lunch

135
00:07:01,942 --> 00:07:04,376
with his stalker. What is she like?

136
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:07,279
Remember Kathy Bates in Misery?

137
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:08,862
Well, she looks

138
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,375
the exact opposite of that.

139
00:07:11,386 --> 00:07:13,354
And she's not crazy?

140
00:07:13,455 --> 00:07:14,467
Oh, no.

141
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:15,479
She's a total whack-job.

142
00:07:16,358 --> 00:07:18,354
She thinks that Joey is

143
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,350
actually Dr. Drake Ramoray.

144
00:07:20,462 --> 00:07:22,293
Oh, my God.

145
00:07:22,364 --> 00:07:24,332
And he's going out with her?

146
00:07:24,332 --> 00:07:26,300
He cannot pursue this.

147
00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:28,381
Just because she thinks she can truly

148
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:33,270
see Joey through her magic box doesn't mean she's not a person.

149
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,871
Does she not deserve happiness

150
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,367
or love?

151
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:39,475
Why are you looking at me?

152
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:41,471
He wants to boff the maniac.

153
00:07:42,584 --> 00:07:44,313
Are you okay?

154
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:46,320
No, I'm nervous.

155
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:47,951
Maybe if I picture them

156
00:07:47,951 --> 00:07:49,481
in their underwear....

157
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:52,288
That's not a good idea.

158
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:54,284
That's why the last guy got fired.

159
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,325
I'm used to playing for grownups.

160
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:01,899
Grownups drink coffee,

161
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:03,429
do their grownup thing.

162
00:08:04,273 --> 00:08:06,434
And kids listen.

163
00:08:08,243 --> 00:08:10,438
It's just a huge responsibility.

164
00:08:11,246 --> 00:08:12,235
What?

165
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:14,281
Are you gonna kiss me?

166
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,444
I was thinking about it.

167
00:08:17,386 --> 00:08:18,375
Okay.

168
00:08:21,456 --> 00:08:24,357
Alrighty. Let's play some tunes.

169
00:08:26,295 --> 00:08:27,791
Let's go find our seats.

170
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,287
Chandler?

171
00:08:29,364 --> 00:08:31,355
Hold on a second.

172
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:33,359
He thinks he can.

173
00:08:35,304 --> 00:08:37,295
He thinks he can.

174
00:08:38,407 --> 00:08:40,398
Oh, what the hell?

175
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:42,409
He can.

176
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:46,392
Hi, everybody. I'm Phoebe.

177
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,371
Hi, Phoebe!

178
00:08:51,386 --> 00:08:53,337
I'm gonna play some songs

179
00:08:53,337 --> 00:08:55,288
about grandparents, okay?

180
00:08:57,426 --> 00:08:58,922
Now Grandma's a person

181
00:08:58,922 --> 00:09:00,418
Who everyone likes

182
00:09:01,229 --> 00:09:02,725
She bought you a train

183
00:09:02,725 --> 00:09:04,221
And a bright shiny bike

184
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,800
But lately she hasn't

185
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,267
Been coming to dinner

186
00:09:07,369 --> 00:09:09,399
And last time you saw her

187
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,429
She looked so much thinner

188
00:09:11,473 --> 00:09:13,373
Now, your mom and your dad said

189
00:09:13,373 --> 00:09:15,273
She moved to Peru

190
00:09:15,344 --> 00:09:16,908
But the truth is she died

191
00:09:16,908 --> 00:09:18,472
And someday you will too

192
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:32,255
I'll have the grilled salmon.

193
00:09:32,361 --> 00:09:35,455
And the doctor will have the risotto.

194
00:09:36,498 --> 00:09:38,881
Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?

195
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:41,264
Yeah, it is.

196
00:09:42,371 --> 00:09:43,463
What?

197
00:09:44,473 --> 00:09:49,405
Well, here we sit, devil-may-care and a while ago you were

198
00:09:49,405 --> 00:09:51,401
re-attaching Simone's spinal cord.

199
00:09:51,513 --> 00:09:53,378
That was a tricky one.

200
00:09:55,317 --> 00:09:57,865
In reality, that operation takes 10

201
00:09:57,865 --> 00:10:00,413
hours. They only showed two minutes.

202
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,290
Who's ''they''?

203
00:10:04,593 --> 00:10:06,390
No one.

204
00:10:07,596 --> 00:10:09,945
Drake, you are so talented.

205
00:10:09,945 --> 00:10:12,294
Let me see those hands.

206
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:14,528
These hands, these beautiful hands.

207
00:10:15,504 --> 00:10:17,495
I could just eat them.

208
00:10:18,306 --> 00:10:19,330
But I won't.

209
00:10:20,308 --> 00:10:22,401
Otherwise my watch would fall off.

210
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:30,408
No, seriously.

211
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:33,332
These hands, these miracle,

212
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,345
magical, life-giving hands.

213
00:10:35,424 --> 00:10:37,420
Just to be near them, touch them,

214
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,416
maybe even lick one?

215
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:42,520
All right. Just one.

216
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:54,341
You're good at that.

217
00:10:55,644 --> 00:10:57,976
Oh, my God! Someone, he's choking.

218
00:10:57,976 --> 00:11:00,308
Is anyone here a doctor?

219
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,412
Yes, the best doctor in Salem.

220
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,408
Dr. Drake Ramoray.

221
00:11:21,503 --> 00:11:23,516
Meet me in the nocturnal

222
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,529
house in 1 5 minutes.

223
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,458
Hey, look. I don't really enjoy

224
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,506
being with other men that way.

225
00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:36,340
But...zoo dollars?

226
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:39,410
It's about your monkey.

227
00:11:40,355 --> 00:11:41,617
It's alive.

228
00:11:56,371 --> 00:11:57,901
I don't understand.

229
00:11:57,901 --> 00:11:59,431
Why didn't you help that man?

230
00:12:00,308 --> 00:12:07,506
Because I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of ''foodal chokage.''

231
00:12:13,321 --> 00:12:15,312
I gotta tell you something--

232
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,453
No.

233
00:12:16,453 --> 00:12:17,516
You don't have to tell me anything.

234
00:12:18,326 --> 00:12:20,487
You don't have to explain yourself.

235
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:22,025
Who am I to question

236
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:23,521
the great Dr. Ramoray?

237
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:25,846
I should be happy to be near you.

238
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,393
Hey, I--

239
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:32,498
Hey what?

240
00:12:33,308 --> 00:12:35,401
That's it. Just hey.

241
00:12:36,344 --> 00:12:38,403
Like at the end of a dance. ''Hey!''

242
00:12:46,321 --> 00:12:48,312
There'll be times when you get older

243
00:12:48,356 --> 00:12:50,386
When you'll want to sleep with people

244
00:12:50,386 --> 00:12:52,416
Just to make them like you

245
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,428
But don't!

246
00:12:54,563 --> 00:12:59,345
'Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do

247
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:00,357
Everybody!

248
00:13:00,468 --> 00:13:02,936
That's another thing

249
00:13:02,936 --> 00:13:05,404
That you don't wanna do

250
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:08,270
Excellent!

251
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,265
Very informative.

252
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:11,472
Not at all inappropriate.

253
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,276
Thank you for coming.

254
00:13:14,276 --> 00:13:16,272
There are cookies in the back.

255
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:18,579
That was great.

256
00:13:19,321 --> 00:13:21,380
The kids loved you.

257
00:13:21,489 --> 00:13:23,423
I rock.

258
00:13:24,392 --> 00:13:25,859
You know why?

259
00:13:25,859 --> 00:13:27,326
Because you told the truth.

260
00:13:27,395 --> 00:13:29,386
Nobody tells kids the truth.

261
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:31,396
You were incredible.

262
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,489
But...?

263
00:13:34,336 --> 00:13:35,883
How'd you know there was a ''but''?

264
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:37,430
I sense things.

265
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:40,303
It was either ''but'' or ''butter.''

266
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,959
I think some of the parents....

267
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:47,844
They were hoping that you'd play songs

268
00:13:47,844 --> 00:13:49,340
about barnyard animals.

269
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:50,509
I can do that.

270
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:53,315
Really?

271
00:13:53,315 --> 00:13:55,311
Because that would be fantastic.

272
00:13:56,324 --> 00:13:58,451
What? You wanna kiss me?

273
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,357
I'm thinking about it.

274
00:14:03,498 --> 00:14:05,449
If I get a library card,

275
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:07,400
can I take you out some time?

276
00:14:12,374 --> 00:14:13,870
What?

277
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,366
I'm unemployed.

278
00:14:20,382 --> 00:14:22,282
The bat.

279
00:14:22,384 --> 00:14:24,375
Ambassador of darkness.

280
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:26,498
Flitting out of his cave

281
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:28,477
like a winged messenger.

282
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:32,385
Sightless specter of the macabre.

283
00:14:33,495 --> 00:14:34,519
Buddy, my monkey?

284
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,293
Oh, yeah, right.

285
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,568
There was a break-in

286
00:14:40,568 --> 00:14:42,536
a few months back. Inside job.

287
00:14:44,306 --> 00:14:46,331
Your monkey was taken.

288
00:14:46,408 --> 00:14:47,955
Along with a snowy egret,

289
00:14:47,955 --> 00:14:51,476
a two-toed sloth and three sweatshirts

290
00:14:51,476 --> 00:14:53,341
from the zoo gift shop.

291
00:14:53,515 --> 00:14:55,011
But the zoo told me

292
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:56,507
that my monkey was dead.

293
00:14:57,352 --> 00:14:58,444
The zoo.

294
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,936
You believe everything

295
00:14:59,936 --> 00:15:01,352
the zoo tells you?

296
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:05,772
That's the only thing

297
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:07,285
the zoo's ever told me.

298
00:15:07,462 --> 00:15:09,413
Of course they say that.

299
00:15:09,413 --> 00:15:11,364
They don't want bad publicity.

300
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:13,263
It's a big cover-up.

301
00:15:13,368 --> 00:15:14,915
Do you have any idea

302
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,462
how high up this thing goes?

303
00:15:17,272 --> 00:15:18,466
That guy Lipson?

304
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:20,467
Lipson knows?

305
00:15:21,376 --> 00:15:22,923
Who else knows?

306
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,470
I only know Lipson.

307
00:15:26,414 --> 00:15:28,382
Lipson knows, huh?

308
00:15:29,384 --> 00:15:30,578
Hello, Mr. Possum.

309
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:33,370
Enigma of the trees,

310
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,321
upside-down denizen of the night.

311
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,907
Taunting gravity--

312
00:15:36,907 --> 00:15:38,391
Buddy, my monkey?

313
00:15:40,395 --> 00:15:42,329
Word on the street--

314
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,426
When I say ''street,''

315
00:15:44,426 --> 00:15:46,422
I mean those pretend streets here.

316
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:48,298
Of course.

317
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:54,440
Your monkey found a new career in the entertainment field.

318
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,340
That's all I know.

319
00:15:57,412 --> 00:15:59,312
This is unbelievable!

320
00:15:59,414 --> 00:16:01,831
So, what is this information

321
00:16:01,831 --> 00:16:04,248
worth to you, my friend?

322
00:16:04,486 --> 00:16:05,936
Are you trying

323
00:16:05,936 --> 00:16:07,386
to get me to bribe you?

324
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:09,354
Maybe.

325
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,291
But you already told me everything.

326
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:24,363
Check it out.

327
00:16:24,506 --> 00:16:27,373
He actually is the Monkeyshine monkey.

328
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:31,274
What'll you do?

329
00:16:31,312 --> 00:16:32,859
I'll call the beer company

330
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:34,406
and try to find him.

331
00:16:34,482 --> 00:16:35,995
That's what I did

332
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,508
when I lost my Clydesdales.

333
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,317
Okay, hi again.

334
00:16:40,422 --> 00:16:43,289
Hi, Phoebe.

335
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:46,373
Today we're gonna start with

336
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:48,421
some songs about barnyard animals.

337
00:16:49,531 --> 00:16:51,931
The cow in the meadow goes moo

338
00:16:51,931 --> 00:16:54,331
The cow in the meadow goes moo

339
00:16:54,402 --> 00:16:56,467
The farmer hits him and grinds him up

340
00:16:56,467 --> 00:16:58,532
And that's how we get hamburgers

341
00:17:01,543 --> 00:17:05,274
Now chickens!

342
00:17:06,281 --> 00:17:08,812
-You're the only one who can save her.

343
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:11,343
-Damn it. I'm a doctor. I'm not God.

344
00:17:11,453 --> 00:17:13,478
There goes my belief system.

345
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,349
It's Erika.

346
00:17:17,392 --> 00:17:19,326
Quick. Shut off the TV.

347
00:17:19,326 --> 00:17:21,260
I wanna see what happens.

348
00:17:21,362 --> 00:17:22,408
I get Leslie out of the coma.

349
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,454
We kiss.

350
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:26,290
You were just kissing Sabrina.

351
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:28,352
Rachel, it's a world

352
00:17:28,352 --> 00:17:30,303
where Joey is a neurosurgeon.

353
00:17:33,475 --> 00:17:35,272
Hey, Erika. Come in.

354
00:17:35,343 --> 00:17:36,907
How'd you get here so fast?

355
00:17:36,907 --> 00:17:38,471
I just saw you in Salem.

356
00:17:38,513 --> 00:17:41,482
Right, they choppered me in.

357
00:17:42,317 --> 00:17:43,409
What's up?

358
00:17:43,485 --> 00:17:45,476
You're having a party too.

359
00:17:46,287 --> 00:17:47,299
Is she here?

360
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,311
Who?

361
00:17:48,423 --> 00:17:50,482
Sabrina. I know about you two.

362
00:17:51,292 --> 00:17:52,407
I saw you

363
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:53,522
kissing in the doctor's lounge.

364
00:17:55,396 --> 00:17:57,330
It's not what you think--

365
00:17:57,398 --> 00:17:59,593
You told me I was the only one.

366
00:18:03,371 --> 00:18:04,338
All right, look.

367
00:18:04,338 --> 00:18:05,305
That's it.

368
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,431
We shouldn't see each other.

369
00:18:07,475 --> 00:18:12,336
I should have told you before but I am not Drake Ramoray.

370
00:18:12,447 --> 00:18:14,415
I'm not a doctor. I'm an actor.

371
00:18:14,415 --> 00:18:16,383
I pretend to be a doctor.

372
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:18,351
Oh, my God.

373
00:18:18,351 --> 00:18:20,251
Do the people at the hospital know?

374
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,483
Somebody wanna help me out here?

375
00:18:26,261 --> 00:18:28,252
Oh, I know. I know.

376
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:30,260
Where am I?

377
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:34,394
University Hospital  where you've been for 18 years.

378
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,495
How can you be here and there?

379
00:18:38,373 --> 00:18:40,273
Because it's a TV show.

380
00:18:40,475 --> 00:18:42,375
What are you getting at?

381
00:18:44,379 --> 00:18:47,314
Nice girl. Not great with concepts.

382
00:18:48,383 --> 00:18:49,475
I'm not Drake.

383
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:51,400
That's right.

384
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,515
He's not Drake. He's Hans Ramoray, Drake's evil twin.

385
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:03,320
Is this true?

386
00:19:03,464 --> 00:19:05,432
Yes. Yes, it is true.

387
00:19:06,234 --> 00:19:09,783
And I know this because he pretended

388
00:19:09,783 --> 00:19:11,330
to be Drake to sleep with me.

389
00:19:17,478 --> 00:19:18,928
And he told me

390
00:19:18,928 --> 00:19:20,378
he would run away with me.

391
00:19:20,481 --> 00:19:22,244
And he didn't.

392
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:25,815
And you left the toilet seat up,

393
00:19:25,815 --> 00:19:27,345
you bastard!

394
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,451
Is all this true?

395
00:19:37,498 --> 00:19:40,558
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

396
00:19:41,302 --> 00:19:43,361
You deserve much better than me.

397
00:19:43,404 --> 00:19:45,838
You deserve to be with the real Drake,

398
00:19:45,838 --> 00:19:48,272
who you fell in love with.

399
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:50,400
Go to Salem. Find him.

400
00:19:50,511 --> 00:19:52,479
He's the guy for you.

401
00:19:53,281 --> 00:19:54,407
Oh, Hans.

402
00:19:57,418 --> 00:19:58,407
Hans?

403
00:19:58,486 --> 00:19:59,475
Hans.

404
00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:03,323
Yo, evil twin!

405
00:20:03,524 --> 00:20:06,288
Right. Goodbye, Erika.

406
00:20:07,528 --> 00:20:09,496
Good luck in Salem.

407
00:20:10,498 --> 00:20:12,398
Take care.

408
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:15,334
I'll never forget you, Hans.

409
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:21,975
Okay, the people who threw the water!

410
00:20:21,975 --> 00:20:24,443
Helping you out.

411
00:20:24,512 --> 00:20:26,309
Fired?

412
00:20:26,447 --> 00:20:27,505
Why?

413
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:30,813
The library board got complaints

414
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,310
from parents about your songs.

415
00:20:33,521 --> 00:20:36,319
I can't believe it. The library?

416
00:20:36,424 --> 00:20:38,449
Books. Free speech.

417
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,043
Newspapers on sticks.

418
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:41,527
I know.

419
00:20:41,562 --> 00:20:44,497
And the kids? Did you tell your board

420
00:20:44,497 --> 00:20:47,432
that the kids want to hear the truth?

421
00:20:48,436 --> 00:20:49,528
No.

422
00:20:51,572 --> 00:20:53,369
I see.

423
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:55,437
Maybe if you just played

424
00:20:55,437 --> 00:20:57,433
some regular kiddie songs....

425
00:20:57,478 --> 00:20:58,974
No. What do you want me to be?

426
00:20:58,974 --> 00:21:04,479
Like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?

427
00:21:05,486 --> 00:21:07,386
You don't have to be Barney.

428
00:21:07,386 --> 00:21:09,286
Who's Barney?

429
00:21:15,396 --> 00:21:16,522
You'll never believe it.

430
00:21:17,332 --> 00:21:17,878
Let me guess.

431
00:21:17,878 --> 00:21:18,424
What?

432
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:22,299
Some Weebles actually do fall down?

433
00:21:22,503 --> 00:21:24,471
A stitch in time now only saves seven?

434
00:21:24,471 --> 00:21:26,439
What do you got?

435
00:21:27,508 --> 00:21:31,410
Well never mind.

436
00:21:31,546 --> 00:21:32,535
What? What?

437
00:21:33,348 --> 00:21:34,895
I tracked down Marcel.

438
00:21:34,895 --> 00:21:38,513
He's healthy, he's happy and he's in New York filming

439
00:21:38,513 --> 00:21:40,509
Outbreak 2: The Virus Takes Manhattan.

440
00:21:40,555 --> 00:21:42,318
You're kidding!

441
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:43,407
This is amazing.

442
00:21:43,407 --> 00:21:44,357
I know.

443
00:21:44,459 --> 00:21:46,040
I finally get on TV and

444
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,621
the monkey's making movies.

445
00:21:49,564 --> 00:21:51,327
Rachel, I'm ready.

446
00:21:55,536 --> 00:21:57,919
Excuse me. Is this where the

447
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,302
singing lady is, who tells the truth?

448
00:22:00,575 --> 00:22:02,304
I guess that's me.

449
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:06,269
She's here!

450
00:22:14,322 --> 00:22:16,415
Sometimes men love women

451
00:22:16,491 --> 00:22:19,392
Sometimes men love men

452
00:22:19,494 --> 00:22:22,292
Then there are bisexuals

453
00:22:22,397 --> 00:22:24,348
Though some just say

454
00:22:24,348 --> 00:22:26,299
They're kidding themselves

455
00:22:35,443 --> 00:22:38,310
I haven't seen my monkey in a year.

456
00:22:38,413 --> 00:22:40,506
You never look down in the shower?

457
00:22:41,516 --> 00:22:43,512
I'm not allowed one joke

458
00:22:43,512 --> 00:22:45,508
in the ''monkey is penis'' genre?

459
00:22:46,354 --> 00:22:47,412
Back up, please.

460
00:22:47,522 --> 00:22:49,353
Back up. Come on.

461
00:22:49,424 --> 00:22:50,521
Excuse me.

462
00:22:50,521 --> 00:22:51,618
Where can we find the monkey?

463
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,520
It's a closed set.

464
00:22:53,561 --> 00:22:55,444
You don't understand.

465
00:22:55,444 --> 00:22:57,327
I'm a friend of his.

466
00:22:57,365 --> 00:22:59,424
We used to live together.

467
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:00,963
I have a timeshare

468
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:02,459
in the Poconos with Flipper.

469
00:23:05,473 --> 00:23:06,462
There he is!

470
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,275
Hey! Buddy!

471
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:11,470
Marcel. Marcel!

472
00:23:18,386 --> 00:23:19,478
In the jungle

473
00:23:20,288 --> 00:23:21,516
The mighty jungle

474
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,485
The lion sleeps tonight

475
00:23:27,528 --> 00:23:29,012
In the jungle

476
00:23:29,012 --> 00:23:30,496
The mighty jungle

477
00:23:30,531 --> 00:23:33,500
The lion sleeps tonight

478
00:24:04,265 --> 00:24:05,459
Excuse me, this is a--

479
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,400
Closed set. We know.

480
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,300
We're friends with the monkey.

481
00:24:11,405 --> 00:24:12,463
Good morning.

482
00:24:13,274 --> 00:24:14,838
Look who I brought!

483
00:24:14,838 --> 00:24:16,402
Your friend, Harry Elefante.

484
00:24:20,314 --> 00:24:23,283
Whoa, dude. Burn.

485
00:24:23,384 --> 00:24:25,335
I don't get it. He seemed

486
00:24:25,335 --> 00:24:27,286
so happy to see me yesterday.

487
00:24:27,388 --> 00:24:29,436
Don't take it personal. He's under

488
00:24:29,436 --> 00:24:31,484
pressure, starring in a movie.

489
00:24:33,394 --> 00:24:35,385
How big of a star is Marcel?

490
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:40,430
In human terms? I'd say Cybill Shepherd.

491
00:24:43,504 --> 00:24:45,472
So you guys in the movie

492
00:24:45,472 --> 00:24:47,440
or you just really paranoid?

493
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,299
Hey, Sal?

494
00:24:50,344 --> 00:24:51,891
Jerry's asking if the monkey's ready.

495
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:53,438
Excuse me?

496
00:24:53,548 --> 00:24:54,998
Jerry is the director?

497
00:24:54,998 --> 00:24:56,448
Which one's he?

498
00:24:56,517 --> 00:24:58,610
The one in the director's chair.

499
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,444
Gotcha.

500
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:02,369
Pheebs, walk with me.

501
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:03,449
Okay.

502
00:25:03,491 --> 00:25:06,358
Why am I walking with you?

503
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,360
We're going over here

504
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,459
so we can get away from the horrible flesh-eating virus!

505
00:25:13,267 --> 00:25:14,313
For the love of God,

506
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:15,359
listen to me!

507
00:25:15,469 --> 00:25:17,460
Is he looking? Is he looking?

508
00:25:24,412 --> 00:25:25,458
We've got a problem.

509
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:26,504
Tell me.

510
00:25:27,281 --> 00:25:28,930
Can't do Chris' makeup.

511
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,579
She won't acknowledge her mustache.

512
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:32,849
Is it bad?

513
00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:34,379
It looks like her eyebrow fell down.

514
00:25:34,488 --> 00:25:36,985
Unless we convince her to bleach it,

515
00:25:36,985 --> 00:25:39,482
Van Damme will be kissing Gabe Kaplan.

516
00:25:41,295 --> 00:25:42,489
I'll talk to her.

517
00:25:43,331 --> 00:25:44,593
I hate actors.

518
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:47,512
Nice camouflage. For a minute,

519
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,491
I almost didn't see you.

520
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,529
Excuse me.

521
00:25:56,611 --> 00:25:58,442
Is your name Chandler?

522
00:25:58,546 --> 00:25:59,945
Yes, it is.

523
00:25:59,945 --> 00:26:01,344
Chandler Bing?

524
00:26:01,382 --> 00:26:03,316
Do you know me

525
00:26:03,316 --> 00:26:05,250
or are you just good at this game?

526
00:26:05,386 --> 00:26:06,375
I'm Susie Moss.

527
00:26:07,288 --> 00:26:09,256
Fourth grade? Glasses?

528
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,937
I carried a box of

529
00:26:10,937 --> 00:26:12,484
animal crackers like a purse?

530
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,249
Susie Moss.

531
00:26:14,395 --> 00:26:16,363
Right. Yeah. Wow.

532
00:26:17,298 --> 00:26:18,390
You look....

533
00:26:19,266 --> 00:26:21,291
Great job growing up.

534
00:26:21,402 --> 00:26:23,450
It's nice to see you don't still

535
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,498
wear the cap with the mirrors.

536
00:26:26,273 --> 00:26:27,888
I graduated fourth grade

537
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:29,503
and realized I wasn't a pimp.

538
00:26:30,277 --> 00:26:31,471
Remember the class play?

539
00:26:31,512 --> 00:26:33,963
You pulled up my skirt and the

540
00:26:33,963 --> 00:26:36,414
entire auditorium saw my underpants?

541
00:26:37,518 --> 00:26:39,901
Yes. Back then,

542
00:26:39,901 --> 00:26:42,284
I used humor as a defense mechanism.

543
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,483
Thank God I don't do that anymore.

544
00:26:46,527 --> 00:26:48,506
So? What have you

545
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,485
been doing since childhood?

546
00:26:51,298 --> 00:26:54,290
Well, I got a new belt.

547
00:26:54,502 --> 00:26:55,491
I wondered.

548
00:27:00,274 --> 00:27:00,854
Oh, my God.

549
00:27:00,854 --> 00:27:01,434
What? What?

550
00:27:02,276 --> 00:27:04,244
It's Jean-Claude Van Damme.

551
00:27:04,345 --> 00:27:05,812
I didn't know he was in this.

552
00:27:05,812 --> 00:27:07,279
He is so hot.

553
00:27:07,448 --> 00:27:08,472
You think?

554
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,846
The Muscles from Brussels?

555
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:12,342
Wham-Bam Van Damme?

556
00:27:12,453 --> 00:27:14,250
Did you see Timecop?

557
00:27:14,355 --> 00:27:16,403
No. Was he any good in it?

558
00:27:16,403 --> 00:27:18,451
Rachel, he totally changed time.

559
00:27:20,394 --> 00:27:22,453
So why don't you go talk to him?

560
00:27:23,497 --> 00:27:25,380
Go tell him he's cute.

561
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,263
What could happen?

562
00:27:27,301 --> 00:27:28,359
He could hear me.

563
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,966
I'm doing it for you.

564
00:27:30,966 --> 00:27:32,462
Don't you dare. Don't.

565
00:27:32,573 --> 00:27:33,505
Don't!

566
00:27:34,408 --> 00:27:36,273
Tell him I cook.

567
00:27:37,378 --> 00:27:38,845
Excuse me. Hi.

568
00:27:38,845 --> 00:27:40,312
Hi.

569
00:27:41,282 --> 00:27:50,415
This is gonna sound kind of goofy...but my friend over there who cooks, by the way....

570
00:27:50,491 --> 00:27:52,391
She thinks you're cute.

571
00:27:52,426 --> 00:27:54,394
You don't think I'm cute?

572
00:27:56,297 --> 00:27:57,491
I don't know.

573
00:27:58,299 --> 00:27:59,527
Do you think you're cute?

574
00:28:02,236 --> 00:28:03,851
We're getting off the track.

575
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:08,252
I was supposed to tell you my friend thinks you're cute.

576
00:28:08,252 --> 00:28:10,231
What should I tell her?

577
00:28:11,345 --> 00:28:13,410
You can tell her

578
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,475
I think her friend is cute.

579
00:28:23,457 --> 00:28:24,924
Stephen Hurs would

580
00:28:24,924 --> 00:28:26,391
eat things for money.

581
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,485
David Stein had no elbows.

582
00:28:29,263 --> 00:28:31,458
Who got caught masturbating?

583
00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:33,899
That's not what he was doing.

584
00:28:33,899 --> 00:28:36,299
He was looking for his bus money.

585
00:28:37,571 --> 00:28:39,021
Makeup!

586
00:28:39,021 --> 00:28:40,471
That's me. I gotta go.

587
00:28:42,376 --> 00:28:43,468
Oh. Okay.

588
00:28:44,411 --> 00:28:46,891
How many times must I touch you on

589
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,371
the arm before you ask me on a date?

590
00:28:51,385 --> 00:28:53,376
Well, let's try one more.

591
00:28:55,322 --> 00:28:57,313
There you go. Ernie's, 8:00?

592
00:28:57,424 --> 00:28:58,482
I'll be there.

593
00:28:59,293 --> 00:29:01,375
And if things go well, maybe this time

594
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:03,457
I'll get to see your underwear.

595
00:29:10,237 --> 00:29:12,262
No one was around to hear that?

596
00:29:17,344 --> 00:29:18,470
So, what did he say?

597
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,474
What a jerk!

598
00:29:21,248 --> 00:29:22,812
I kept talking about you

599
00:29:22,812 --> 00:29:24,376
and he kept asking me out.

600
00:29:26,554 --> 00:29:29,455
Naturally, you know, I said no.

601
00:29:32,459 --> 00:29:34,256
Thanks anyway.

602
00:29:34,295 --> 00:29:38,356
He just kept asking and asking, asking, asking....

603
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:39,849
If you want to go out with him,

604
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:41,299
you can.

605
00:29:42,403 --> 00:29:44,462
Sounds like a jerk to me, but--

606
00:29:44,572 --> 00:29:46,437
Jean-Claude, she said yes.

607
00:29:46,437 --> 00:29:48,302
I'll see you tonight.

608
00:29:50,511 --> 00:29:52,376
Thank you.

609
00:29:58,485 --> 00:29:59,935
Then Jean-Claude took me

610
00:29:59,935 --> 00:30:03,001
to Crossroads where we hung out

611
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,514
with Drew Barrymore.

612
00:30:05,292 --> 00:30:07,317
Oh, man. She's so smoking.

613
00:30:07,394 --> 00:30:09,328
She has the greatest set--

614
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,528
No guys around, huh?

615
00:30:16,403 --> 00:30:17,870
Anybody need anything?

616
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,337
I'll have espresso.

617
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,470
I'll get it. If I ask you,

618
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,500
you'll end up drinking it yourself.

619
00:30:26,513 --> 00:30:27,525
That is so unfair.

620
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:28,537
I know.

621
00:30:29,316 --> 00:30:31,364
Like you'd drink her coffee after

622
00:30:31,364 --> 00:30:33,412
what you did with Van Damme?

623
00:30:34,421 --> 00:30:36,616
I have to cancel racquetball tonight.

624
00:30:37,358 --> 00:30:38,888
Marcel's trainer will let me

625
00:30:38,888 --> 00:30:40,418
have him for a while.

626
00:30:40,527 --> 00:30:42,478
You're blowing me off?

627
00:30:42,478 --> 00:30:44,429
We can reschedule for Saturday.

628
00:30:45,466 --> 00:30:46,950
Unless you hook up

629
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,434
with a bunch of pigeons.

630
00:30:49,536 --> 00:30:53,431
Stick a fork in me...I am done.

631
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:56,492
Stick a fork what?

632
00:30:56,492 --> 00:30:58,443
Like when you're cooking a steak.

633
00:30:58,479 --> 00:31:00,310
I don't eat meat.

634
00:31:01,415 --> 00:31:02,495
How do you know

635
00:31:02,495 --> 00:31:03,575
when vegetables are done?

636
00:31:04,318 --> 00:31:05,814
You don't.

637
00:31:05,814 --> 00:31:07,310
You eat them and you can tell.

638
00:31:07,421 --> 00:31:09,321
Then eat me, I'm done.

639
00:31:12,526 --> 00:31:14,494
I've met the perfect woman.

640
00:31:14,595 --> 00:31:20,392
We're on her couch, fooling around and then she turns to me and says:

641
00:31:20,501 --> 00:31:23,299
''Ever want to do it in an elevator?''

642
00:31:24,338 --> 00:31:25,885
What did you say?

643
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:27,432
I believe my exact words were:

644
00:31:30,411 --> 00:31:32,009
How do you know if you wanna do that?

645
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:33,607
You just know.

646
00:31:43,424 --> 00:31:44,920
We gotta go.

647
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,416
Got a reservation in 30 minutes.

648
00:31:47,428 --> 00:31:49,942
No. What I had planned shouldn't take

649
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:52,456
more than two, three minutes, tops.

650
00:31:53,434 --> 00:31:54,981
Two hundred seconds of passion!

651
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:56,528
We gotta go.

652
00:31:58,439 --> 00:32:02,274
But here's an idea.

653
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,860
Have you ever worn

654
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,310
women's underwear?

655
00:32:07,314 --> 00:32:12,510
Well, yes, actually but they were my Aunt Edna's.

656
00:32:13,387 --> 00:32:16,288
And there were three of us in there.

657
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:18,787
I was thinking

658
00:32:18,787 --> 00:32:23,386
it would be kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight at dinner.

659
00:32:28,302 --> 00:32:30,395
You want me to wear your panties?

660
00:32:30,504 --> 00:32:31,528
Could you?

661
00:32:32,406 --> 00:32:34,419
If I wear your underwear,

662
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,432
then what would you be wearing?

663
00:32:44,318 --> 00:32:46,309
You're swell.

664
00:32:49,556 --> 00:32:52,525
Got the music. Got the dinner.

665
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,043
I made Marcel's favorite dish,

666
00:32:54,043 --> 00:32:57,556
banana cake with mealworm.

667
00:33:02,503 --> 00:33:04,368
Candle.

668
00:33:05,305 --> 00:33:06,835
What do you think's

669
00:33:06,835 --> 00:33:08,365
gonna happen here tonight?

670
00:33:12,413 --> 00:33:13,402
Hello.

671
00:33:14,415 --> 00:33:16,474
Hi, are you on your way over--?

672
00:33:21,522 --> 00:33:23,473
No, I understand.

673
00:33:23,473 --> 00:33:25,424
A monkey's gotta work.

674
00:33:27,428 --> 00:33:30,363
It's no big deal. It's not like

675
00:33:30,363 --> 00:33:33,298
I had anything special planned.

676
00:33:34,334 --> 00:33:35,494
Yeah. Okay.

677
00:33:36,303 --> 00:33:37,497
Okay. Bye.

678
00:33:48,415 --> 00:33:50,508
I'm sorry, man.

679
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,435
Feel that?

680
00:33:54,435 --> 00:33:55,350
What?

681
00:33:55,422 --> 00:33:56,969
The moment we should have

682
00:33:56,969 --> 00:33:58,516
stopped holding hands?

683
00:34:01,562 --> 00:34:03,513
Rachel, why don't you

684
00:34:03,513 --> 00:34:05,464
start talking first?

685
00:34:05,499 --> 00:34:06,949
All right.

686
00:34:06,949 --> 00:34:08,399
This is totally unjustified.

687
00:34:08,502 --> 00:34:09,998
She gave me the green light.

688
00:34:09,998 --> 00:34:11,494
I did nothing--

689
00:34:14,274 --> 00:34:15,770
Do you think I can't

690
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,266
see you in the TV set?

691
00:34:20,414 --> 00:34:21,898
If there is something

692
00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:23,382
you'd like to share--

693
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,315
You had no right.

694
00:34:25,419 --> 00:34:26,915
That's the most ridiculous--

695
00:34:26,915 --> 00:34:28,411
You sold me out.

696
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:29,456
I did not.

697
00:34:29,456 --> 00:34:30,423
You absolutely--

698
00:34:30,491 --> 00:34:32,482
Would you let me talk?

699
00:34:35,496 --> 00:34:37,396
Did you just flick me?

700
00:34:39,299 --> 00:34:41,529
You wouldn't let me finish and I was--

701
00:34:43,403 --> 00:34:45,337
That hurt.

702
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:46,597
Quit flicking.

703
00:34:47,341 --> 00:34:48,825
Stop flicking!

704
00:34:48,825 --> 00:34:50,309
You flicked me first!

705
00:34:56,483 --> 00:34:57,609
Let's not do this.

706
00:35:01,388 --> 00:35:04,255
Happy thoughts. Happy thoughts.

707
00:35:12,266 --> 00:35:14,257
Now I'm gonna kick some ass.

708
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,908
All right.

709
00:35:24,908 --> 00:35:26,506
Now, I will let go if you both stop.

710
00:35:27,514 --> 00:35:30,278
You want me to stop seeing him?

711
00:35:31,385 --> 00:35:32,932
You want me to tell him

712
00:35:32,932 --> 00:35:34,479
you're seeing him instead?

713
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:36,284
Is that what you want?

714
00:35:36,284 --> 00:35:37,279
Okay.

715
00:35:39,393 --> 00:35:41,327
That's what you want?

716
00:35:41,395 --> 00:35:43,295
Yes.

717
00:35:43,497 --> 00:35:44,896
Fine.

718
00:35:44,896 --> 00:35:46,295
Fine.

719
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,458
There we go.

720
00:35:48,535 --> 00:35:50,469
If we were in prison,

721
00:35:50,469 --> 00:35:52,403
you guys would be my bitches.

722
00:36:00,347 --> 00:36:02,298
Thanks for letting me tag along.

723
00:36:02,298 --> 00:36:04,249
Forget about it.

724
00:36:05,252 --> 00:36:07,243
How you doing there, squirmy?

725
00:36:07,387 --> 00:36:09,252
I'm hanging in.

726
00:36:09,389 --> 00:36:10,481
And a little out.

727
00:36:14,294 --> 00:36:16,489
So, assistant to the director?

728
00:36:17,364 --> 00:36:19,315
That's an exciting job.

729
00:36:19,315 --> 00:36:21,266
You must have responsibilities--

730
00:36:21,301 --> 00:36:22,427
I don't do the casting.

731
00:36:22,502 --> 00:36:25,266
What are you guys gonna eat?

732
00:36:26,473 --> 00:36:28,873
How come all I can think about is

733
00:36:28,873 --> 00:36:33,575
putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over?

734
00:36:35,515 --> 00:36:37,966
'Cause I went to an all-boys high

735
00:36:37,966 --> 00:36:40,417
school and God is making up for it?

736
00:36:48,495 --> 00:36:52,430
I want you right here right now.

737
00:36:52,499 --> 00:36:54,399
Right now, right here?

738
00:36:54,434 --> 00:36:55,918
Don't you think

739
00:36:55,918 --> 00:36:57,402
we're in a public place?

740
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,535
They do have the shrimp.

741
00:37:04,444 --> 00:37:06,435
Meet me in the bathroom.

742
00:37:13,253 --> 00:37:16,245
I'm going to the bathroom now.

743
00:37:23,497 --> 00:37:26,489
He likes to keep us in the loop.

744
00:37:33,473 --> 00:37:34,497
Come on.

745
00:37:37,411 --> 00:37:39,504
I can't believe we're doing this.

746
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,372
All right, mister.

747
00:37:41,515 --> 00:37:43,506
Let's see those panties.

748
00:37:45,285 --> 00:37:46,411
Alrighty.

749
00:37:50,324 --> 00:37:51,854
But you know what

750
00:37:51,854 --> 00:37:53,384
would be even sexier?

751
00:37:53,493 --> 00:37:54,482
What?

752
00:37:55,295 --> 00:37:56,893
If you didn't have

753
00:37:56,893 --> 00:37:58,491
your shirt tucked into them.

754
00:38:01,234 --> 00:38:03,299
All right. Now, I would like

755
00:38:03,299 --> 00:38:05,364
to see you wearing nothing but them.

756
00:38:05,439 --> 00:38:08,237
Take your clothes off.

757
00:38:08,342 --> 00:38:10,407
I hope you realize we'll miss

758
00:38:10,407 --> 00:38:12,472
hearing about the specials.

759
00:38:14,381 --> 00:38:15,370
Come on, hurry.

760
00:38:15,482 --> 00:38:16,966
Do you want this done quick

761
00:38:16,966 --> 00:38:18,450
or done right?

762
00:38:19,286 --> 00:38:20,867
All right, turn around.

763
00:38:20,867 --> 00:38:22,448
I wanna see you from behind.

764
00:38:23,457 --> 00:38:25,453
Somebody's been doing

765
00:38:25,453 --> 00:38:27,449
his Buns of Steel video.

766
00:38:28,261 --> 00:38:29,825
So you want me

767
00:38:29,825 --> 00:38:31,389
to clench anything or...?

768
00:38:35,302 --> 00:38:36,394
Susie?

769
00:38:37,371 --> 00:38:38,463
Susie?

770
00:38:38,505 --> 00:38:41,269
This is for the 4th grade.

771
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:45,941
What do you mean?

772
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:47,471
What do I mean?

773
00:38:47,514 --> 00:38:48,947
I mean underpants, mister.

774
00:38:48,947 --> 00:38:50,380
That's what.

775
00:38:51,385 --> 00:38:53,285
What? What do you mean?

776
00:38:53,387 --> 00:38:57,389
My skirt you lifted. Kids laughing.

777
00:38:57,491 --> 00:39:00,324
I was Susie Underpants till I was 18.

778
00:39:02,229 --> 00:39:03,793
That was 4th grade.

779
00:39:03,793 --> 00:39:05,357
How could you still be upset?

780
00:39:06,433 --> 00:39:08,850
Call me in 20 years and tell me

781
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:11,267
if you're still upset about this.

782
00:39:16,343 --> 00:39:18,339
I hope you realize you're not

783
00:39:18,339 --> 00:39:20,335
getting these underpants back.

784
00:39:29,456 --> 00:39:31,356
I can't believe this.

785
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:33,005
Just two weeks ago,

786
00:39:33,005 --> 00:39:36,876
I was watching Sudden Death and now I'm on a date

787
00:39:36,876 --> 00:39:38,457
with Jean-Claude Van Damme.

788
00:39:38,498 --> 00:39:40,466
Can you beat up that guy?

789
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:43,432
Can you beat up that guy?

790
00:39:43,432 --> 00:39:44,495
Sure.

791
00:39:45,272 --> 00:39:47,263
This is so wild.

792
00:39:47,474 --> 00:39:49,971
I gotta admit, I was surprised

793
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:52,468
that you agreed to go on a blind date.

794
00:39:52,512 --> 00:39:54,480
Normally I would not do it.

795
00:39:56,383 --> 00:39:57,850
What made you make

796
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:59,317
the exception for me?

797
00:39:59,386 --> 00:40:02,471
Rachel told me you wanted a threesome

798
00:40:02,471 --> 00:40:04,422
with me and Drew Barrymore.

799
00:40:04,491 --> 00:40:06,004
By the way,

800
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:07,517
Drew has some ground rules and....

801
00:40:11,398 --> 00:40:12,365
Say you're sorry.

802
00:40:12,365 --> 00:40:13,332
No.

803
00:40:14,434 --> 00:40:15,930
Say it!

804
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,426
No! I'm not gonna.

805
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:20,419
Say it. Say it.

806
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:21,499
Oh, great.

807
00:40:23,543 --> 00:40:25,039
Say you're sorry

808
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:26,535
or your sweater gets it.

809
00:40:28,348 --> 00:40:29,929
That is my favorite sweater.

810
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:31,510
My third-date sweater.

811
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,513
Say you're sorry.

812
00:40:36,456 --> 00:40:37,952
You wanna play?

813
00:40:37,952 --> 00:40:39,448
Okay, let's play.

814
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:41,527
Let's play.

815
00:40:46,433 --> 00:40:47,457
What'll you do?

816
00:40:47,567 --> 00:40:49,051
Give me my sweater

817
00:40:49,051 --> 00:40:50,535
or it's handbag marinara.

818
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,371
You don't have the guts.

819
00:40:55,642 --> 00:40:57,593
At least I wasn't too chicken

820
00:40:57,593 --> 00:40:59,544
to tell a guy he was cute.

821
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:13,282
Stop! Stop the madness!

822
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,395
This is crazy.

823
00:41:18,431 --> 00:41:19,927
Who can even remember

824
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:21,423
why you're fighting?

825
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:27,431
Yes, that's right.

826
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,504
But still....

827
00:41:32,312 --> 00:41:33,404
Look at your purse.

828
00:41:34,514 --> 00:41:37,312
Look at your sweater.

829
00:41:37,517 --> 00:41:39,451
Look at yourselves.

830
00:41:43,523 --> 00:41:46,424
I'll help you fix your sweater.

831
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,462
I'll help you throw out your purse.

832
00:41:52,332 --> 00:41:54,459
I'm sorry I made you stop seeing him.

833
00:41:55,535 --> 00:41:57,503
I'm sorry I went out with him

834
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:59,471
when I knew you liked him.

835
00:42:01,408 --> 00:42:04,377
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves.

836
00:42:25,298 --> 00:42:26,344
Joey?

837
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:27,390
Ma?

838
00:42:30,303 --> 00:42:31,395
Joey.

839
00:42:31,504 --> 00:42:32,528
Chandler?

840
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,921
You're still here?

841
00:42:34,921 --> 00:42:36,502
I thought you guys took off.

842
00:42:36,543 --> 00:42:39,307
She took off with my clothes.

843
00:42:40,313 --> 00:42:41,428
Are you naked in there?

844
00:42:41,428 --> 00:42:42,543
Well, not exactly.

845
00:42:44,417 --> 00:42:46,351
I'm wearing panties.

846
00:42:50,557 --> 00:42:52,525
You always wear panties?

847
00:42:54,327 --> 00:42:57,319
No, no. This is the first time.

848
00:42:58,331 --> 00:43:00,390
Wow! Talk about your bad luck.

849
00:43:01,468 --> 00:43:03,919
The first time you try panties and

850
00:43:03,919 --> 00:43:06,370
someone walks off with your clothes.

851
00:43:07,307 --> 00:43:09,286
I was not trying them out.

852
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:11,265
Susie asked me to wear them.

853
00:43:11,378 --> 00:43:12,470
Let me see.

854
00:43:12,512 --> 00:43:14,446
No. I'm not letting you

855
00:43:14,446 --> 00:43:16,380
or anybody else see, ever.

856
00:43:16,483 --> 00:43:18,383
All right, all right.

857
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:25,481
Someone's flossing.

858
00:43:31,498 --> 00:43:34,399
Joey, some people don't like that.

859
00:43:35,535 --> 00:43:37,503
Chandler's wearing panties.

860
00:43:37,604 --> 00:43:40,004
What? Let me see.

861
00:43:40,004 --> 00:43:42,404
You don't have to see.

862
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:45,341
Hi, tushy.

863
00:43:46,613 --> 00:43:49,411
One of you give me your underpants.

864
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:52,511
Can't help you. I'm not wearing any.

865
00:43:53,553 --> 00:43:56,317
How can you not be wearing any?

866
00:43:56,423 --> 00:43:58,357
I'm getting heat from the guy

867
00:43:58,357 --> 00:44:00,291
in the hot pink thong.

868
00:44:01,294 --> 00:44:03,290
Look, Ross. I'll give you

869
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:05,286
$50 for your underpants.

870
00:44:32,325 --> 00:44:33,422
Can I have the milk?

871
00:44:33,422 --> 00:44:34,519
I'm almost done.

872
00:44:35,328 --> 00:44:36,488
Keep your panties on.

873
00:44:43,336 --> 00:44:45,327
I'm in the movie!

874
00:44:45,438 --> 00:44:46,871
What happened?

875
00:44:46,871 --> 00:44:48,304
A victim called in sick.

876
00:44:48,408 --> 00:44:50,404
Cathy recommended me and boom!

877
00:44:50,404 --> 00:44:52,400
I'm dying on a gurney.

878
00:44:53,546 --> 00:44:55,542
Marcel finished his last scene

879
00:44:55,542 --> 00:44:57,538
if you want to say goodbye.

880
00:44:59,419 --> 00:45:01,387
That's okay. He's probably

881
00:45:01,387 --> 00:45:03,355
got parties to go to and stuff.

882
00:45:05,492 --> 00:45:07,426
He's moved on.

883
00:45:07,426 --> 00:45:09,360
That's the way it goes, right?

884
00:45:11,297 --> 00:45:12,394
Oh, my God.

885
00:45:12,394 --> 00:45:13,491
What?

886
00:46:02,248 --> 00:46:03,812
Sorry it didn't work out between us.

887
00:46:03,812 --> 00:46:05,376
Or us.

888
00:46:05,485 --> 00:46:08,386
Drew was very disappointed.

889
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:12,383
Okay. Well, bye.

890
00:46:17,363 --> 00:46:18,352
Goodbye.

891
00:46:20,366 --> 00:46:22,493
Well, bye for me too.

892
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:32,401
Okay. Well, bye-bye again.

893
00:46:35,515 --> 00:46:37,278
Okay.

894
00:46:38,484 --> 00:46:41,385
Perhaps the three of us just could:

895
00:46:41,487 --> 00:46:43,421
Oh, no, no, no, no.

896
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:45,803
Are you sure?

897
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:47,316
I can crush a walnut with my butt.

898
00:46:47,393 --> 00:46:48,940
Oh, no, no, no. Impressive.

899
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,487
But no.

900
00:46:51,297 --> 00:46:52,491
Maybe if I were baking.

901
00:46:53,399 --> 00:46:55,492
Okay. Bye-bye.

902
00:47:00,373 --> 00:47:01,533
Bye, Marcel.

903
00:47:02,342 --> 00:47:04,333
See you on the big screen.

904
00:47:05,245 --> 00:47:06,843
You keep people drinking

905
00:47:06,843 --> 00:47:08,441
that beer, okay?

906
00:47:08,481 --> 00:47:10,381
I'll miss you, buddy.

907
00:47:17,257 --> 00:47:18,349
Bye.

908
00:47:32,405 --> 00:47:33,935
I think I want to write

909
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:35,465
a song about all this.

910
00:47:37,277 --> 00:47:38,841
Except one of the strings

911
00:47:38,841 --> 00:47:40,405
on my guitar is broken.

912
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,472
Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?

913
00:47:43,583 --> 00:47:45,534
How long you been waiting to say that?

914
00:47:45,534 --> 00:47:47,485
About 20 minutes!

915
00:47:54,294 --> 00:47:55,858
Can't you see what's going on here?

916
00:47:55,858 --> 00:47:57,422
This man is dying!

917
00:47:59,332 --> 00:48:00,264
Cut!

918
00:48:01,234 --> 00:48:02,832
Can't you see what's going on here?

919
00:48:02,832 --> 00:48:04,430
This man is dying!

920
00:48:06,372 --> 00:48:07,430
Cut!

921
00:48:09,242 --> 00:48:10,857
Can't you see what's going on here?

922
00:48:10,857 --> 00:48:12,472
This man is dying!

923
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,280
Mommy!

924
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:18,797
Can't you see what's going on?

925
00:48:18,797 --> 00:48:20,344
This man is dead!
