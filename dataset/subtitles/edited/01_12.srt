1
00:00:57,431 --> 00:00:59,228
No, no, we're done!

2
00:01:47,415 --> 00:01:50,213
Aunt Silv, stop yelling!

3
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:51,784
If you'd told me

4
00:01:51,784 --> 00:01:54,383
vegetarian lasagna l would've made

6
00:01:54,383 --> 00:01:55,446
vegetarian lasagna.

7
00:01:57,324 --> 00:01:58,888
The meat's only every third layer.

8
00:01:58,888 --> 00:02:00,452
Maybe you could scrape.

9
00:02:01,462 --> 00:02:02,929
Ross, did you really read

10
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:04,396
all these baby books?

11
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:07,195
You could plunk me down in

12
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:11,251
any woman's uterus, no compass and l could find my way

14
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:12,331
out like that!

15
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,364
This is cool.

16
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,224
It says in some parts of the world

17
00:02:17,224 --> 00:02:19,272
people eat the placenta.

18
00:02:21,215 --> 00:02:23,274
And we're done with the yogurt.

19
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,175
Sorry.

20
00:02:26,387 --> 00:02:28,287
l did this as a favor.

21
00:02:28,287 --> 00:02:30,187
l am not a caterer.

22
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:31,838
What do you want me to do

23
00:02:31,838 --> 00:02:33,385
with a dozen lasagnas?

24
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:36,388
Nice talk, Aunt Silv.

25
00:02:37,298 --> 00:02:38,361
You kiss Uncle Freddie

26
00:02:38,361 --> 00:02:39,424
with that mouth?

27
00:02:40,434 --> 00:02:42,931
Ross, listen. Do you know that right

28
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:45,428
now your baby is only this big?

29
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,202
This is your baby.

30
00:02:47,202 --> 00:02:48,197
''Hi, Daddy.''

31
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:49,398
Hello.

32
00:02:50,244 --> 00:02:53,213
''How come you don't live with Mommy?''

33
00:02:54,415 --> 00:02:55,911
''How come Mommy lives

34
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:57,407
with that other lady?''

35
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:04,280
''What's a lesbian?''

36
00:03:09,296 --> 00:03:11,355
Honey, you can say it. Poconos.

37
00:03:11,465 --> 00:03:16,266
Poconos. It's like ''poke a nose.''

38
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:21,264
Poke a nose.

39
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:30,799
So did l hear Poconos?

40
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,215
Yes.

41
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,849
My sister's giving us her place

42
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:35,379
for the weekend.

43
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,384
First weekend together.

44
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:38,823
It's a big step.

45
00:03:38,823 --> 00:03:40,222
l know.

46
00:03:41,228 --> 00:03:43,276
It's just a weekend. Big deal.

47
00:03:43,276 --> 00:03:45,324
Wasn't this supposed to be a fling?

48
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:49,334
Shouldn't it be flung by now?

50
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:52,295
We are way past a ''fling.''

51
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:54,402
I'm feeling things I've read about

52
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:56,398
in Danielle Steel books.

53
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,960
When I'm with him,

54
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,410
I'm just totally....

55
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:01,261
Nauseous.

56
00:04:01,261 --> 00:04:02,341
I'm physically nauseous.

57
00:04:03,384 --> 00:04:05,284
What am l supposed to do?

58
00:04:05,284 --> 00:04:07,184
Call Immigration?

59
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:09,451
l could call Immigration.

60
00:04:15,162 --> 00:04:16,254
What?

61
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,748
Ugly Naked Guy is making

62
00:04:18,748 --> 00:04:20,198
shadow puppets.

63
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:23,466
Look, it's Abraham Lincoln.

64
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,398
Oh, right!

65
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,369
Go. Go!

66
00:04:35,182 --> 00:04:36,746
l love babies with

67
00:04:36,746 --> 00:04:40,415
their little baby shoes and their little baby toes

69
00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:42,411
and their little hands....

70
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,754
Okay, you're gonna have to stop that.

71
00:04:44,754 --> 00:04:46,318
Forever.

72
00:04:56,403 --> 00:04:58,200
Need a new table.

73
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,168
You think?

74
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:08,276
Come on in.

75
00:05:08,276 --> 00:05:09,271
Hello.

76
00:05:09,383 --> 00:05:13,285
l brought the books and Monica sends her love

78
00:05:13,285 --> 00:05:15,185
along with this lasagna.

79
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:17,252
Great! ls it vegetarian?

80
00:05:17,252 --> 00:05:19,248
Because Susan doesn't eat meat.

81
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:23,354
I'm pretty sure that it is.

82
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:30,220
Nineteen weeks, the breasts

83
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,171
are starting to swell.

84
00:05:33,274 --> 00:05:35,299
According to the literature.

85
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,327
l got the results of the amnio.

86
00:05:37,327 --> 00:05:39,278
Tell me. ls everything...?

87
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,376
Totally and completely healthy.

88
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:43,372
That is great!

89
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:50,286
When did you and Susan

90
00:05:50,286 --> 00:05:51,383
meet Huey Lewis?

91
00:05:52,192 --> 00:05:54,183
That's our friend Tanya.

92
00:06:03,337 --> 00:06:06,135
Of course, it's your friend Tanya.

93
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,210
Don't you wanna know about the sex?

94
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,178
The sex?

95
00:06:13,347 --> 00:06:15,747
I'm having enough trouble with

96
00:06:15,747 --> 00:06:18,147
the image of you and Susan together.

97
00:06:18,185 --> 00:06:20,244
But when you throw in Tanya....

98
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,283
The sex of the baby, Ross.

99
00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:29,352
You know the sex of the baby?

100
00:06:31,198 --> 00:06:31,778
Want to know?

101
00:06:31,778 --> 00:06:32,358
No.

102
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,192
l don't want to. Absolutely not.

103
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,765
You shouldn't know until

104
00:06:36,765 --> 00:06:40,306
you look down there and see, ''Oh, there it is.''

106
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,368
Or isn't.

107
00:06:45,312 --> 00:06:46,358
Hello, Ross.

108
00:06:46,358 --> 00:06:47,404
Susan.

109
00:06:48,215 --> 00:06:49,182
So?

110
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,179
So did you hear?

111
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,280
Yes, we did.

112
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,275
Everything's A-Okay.

113
00:06:53,387 --> 00:06:56,185
Oh, that's so cool!

114
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,383
It really is.

115
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:00,158
Do we know?

116
00:07:00,327 --> 00:07:01,794
We certainly do.

117
00:07:01,794 --> 00:07:03,261
It's going to be a--

118
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,319
Hello?

119
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:06,348
A guy who doesn't wanna know

120
00:07:06,348 --> 00:07:08,265
is standing here.

121
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,866
Well, is it what

122
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:12,362
we thought it would be?

123
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:21,177
What--?

124
00:07:21,348 --> 00:07:23,282
What did we think it'd be?

125
00:07:24,251 --> 00:07:25,314
l don't wanna know.

126
00:07:25,314 --> 00:07:26,377
Don't wanna know.

127
00:07:27,187 --> 00:07:28,381
l should probably just go.

128
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:30,820
Well, thanks for the books.

129
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,384
No problem. Okay.

130
00:07:36,163 --> 00:07:37,187
Susan.

131
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:44,769
Who should we call first?

132
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:47,169
Your folks or Deb and Rhona?

133
00:07:50,477 --> 00:07:52,206
Hello?

134
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:55,293
Never mind.

135
00:07:55,293 --> 00:07:56,305
I don't wanna know.

136
00:07:57,384 --> 00:07:59,267
Because it was my table,

137
00:07:59,267 --> 00:08:01,150
l have to buy a new one?

138
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:03,189
That's the rule.

139
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:05,157
What rule? There's no rule.

140
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:06,789
You owe me a table.

141
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:08,353
How did you get there?

142
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:11,626
It was fine until your breakfast

143
00:08:11,626 --> 00:08:14,123
adventure with Angela Delvecio.

144
00:08:14,268 --> 00:08:16,133
You knew about that?

145
00:08:16,236 --> 00:08:18,249
The impressions in the butter

146
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:20,262
left little to the imagination.

147
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:23,175
How about if we split it?

148
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:25,674
What do you mean, buy it together?

149
00:08:25,674 --> 00:08:27,170
Yeah.

150
00:08:27,347 --> 00:08:29,360
Do you think we're ready for that?

151
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,373
Why not?

152
00:08:32,152 --> 00:08:34,148
It's a big commitment.

153
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:36,144
What if one of us wants to move out?

154
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,185
You're moving out?

155
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:38,180
I'm not.

156
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:39,338
You'd tell me if you were, right?

157
00:08:39,338 --> 00:08:40,384
Yes.

158
00:08:41,161 --> 00:08:43,226
It's just, with my last roommate--

159
00:08:43,226 --> 00:08:45,291
l know all about Kip.

160
00:08:45,365 --> 00:08:47,862
We bought a hibachi, then he ran off

161
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:50,359
and got married. Things got ugly.

162
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:53,270
Let me ask you something.

163
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,369
Was Kip a better roommate than me?

164
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:57,404
Oh, don't do that.

165
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,114
There's changes in your schedule.

166
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:09,213
Your 4:00 herbal massage is at 4:0.

167
00:09:09,256 --> 00:09:10,752
And Miss Summerfield

168
00:09:10,752 --> 00:09:12,248
canceled her 5:0 shiatsu.

169
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:13,348
Thanks.

170
00:09:14,228 --> 00:09:16,128
Oh, here comes your :00.

171
00:09:16,263 --> 00:09:18,214
l don't mean to sound unprofessional,

172
00:09:18,214 --> 00:09:20,165
but-- Yum!

173
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:27,230
Paolo! Hi! What are you doing here?

174
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:34,247
Rachella tell me you massage?

176
00:09:35,148 --> 00:09:37,173
Well, Rachella's right.

177
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:43,179
Oh, okay.

178
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,820
l don't know what you just said,

179
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,350
so let's start.

180
00:09:48,262 --> 00:09:52,255
l am...being naked?

182
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,333
That's your decision.

183
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,267
Some people prefer to take off--

184
00:09:58,305 --> 00:09:59,363
Being naked!

185
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:03,204
l can't believe you don't

186
00:10:03,204 --> 00:10:05,200
wanna know. l couldn't not know.

187
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,746
If the doctor knows,

188
00:10:06,746 --> 00:10:08,213
Carol and Susan know--

189
00:10:08,382 --> 00:10:10,179
And Monica knows.

190
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:13,183
How? l don't even know.

191
00:10:13,287 --> 00:10:14,834
Carol called to thank me

192
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:16,381
for the lasagna. She told me.

193
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,418
So what's it gonna be?

194
00:10:22,195 --> 00:10:24,260
Oh, great! Now he knows.

195
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,325
I'm just excited about being an aunt.

196
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,233
Or an uncle.

197
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,369
Hey, Phoebe.

198
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:35,398
Hey, Pheebs.

199
00:10:35,442 --> 00:10:36,431
Fine!

200
00:10:40,213 --> 00:10:41,811
What's the matter?

201
00:10:41,811 --> 00:10:43,409
Nothing. I'm just out of sorts.

202
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,468
Well, you can use some of my sorts.

203
00:10:45,468 --> 00:10:47,419
l rarely use them.

204
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:49,284
Can we get some cappuccino

205
00:10:49,284 --> 00:10:50,347
over here?

206
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:53,419
Oh, right! That's me!

207
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:58,321
That table place closes at 7. Come on.

208
00:10:58,432 --> 00:10:59,456
Fine.

209
00:11:01,368 --> 00:11:02,392
What is it?

210
00:11:04,204 --> 00:11:06,183
All right. You know Paolo?

211
00:11:06,183 --> 00:11:08,162
I'm familiar with his work.

212
00:11:09,276 --> 00:11:11,176
He made a move on me.

213
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:12,842
The store will be open tomorrow.

214
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:14,406
More coffee, please.

215
00:11:16,383 --> 00:11:18,180
Well, what happened?

216
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:20,281
He came in for a massage,

217
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:22,277
and everything was fine until....

218
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:27,360
Oh, my God.

219
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,327
Are you sure?

220
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,221
Oh, yeah. I'm sure.

221
00:11:36,203 --> 00:11:38,199
And all of a sudden, his hands

222
00:11:38,199 --> 00:11:40,195
weren't the problem anymore.

223
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:45,300
Was it...?

224
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:46,908
Boy Scouts could've camped

225
00:11:46,908 --> 00:11:48,404
under there.

226
00:11:52,352 --> 00:11:53,341
Wow.

227
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:55,387
What did you do?

228
00:11:55,387 --> 00:11:57,321
l dealt with it like a professional.

229
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:05,262
''Ooh,'' what?

230
00:12:05,365 --> 00:12:06,354
--ma Thurman.

231
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:07,814
The actress!

232
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:09,162
Uma Thurman!

233
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,259
Thanks, Rach.

234
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:15,320
What'll you do?

235
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,366
You have to tell her.

236
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,861
It's your moral obligation as a friend,

237
00:12:18,861 --> 00:12:21,312
as a woman. It's a feminist issue.

238
00:12:21,381 --> 00:12:22,370
Guys?

239
00:12:23,183 --> 00:12:24,730
You have to.

240
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,277
Feminist issue? That's where l went.

241
00:12:28,321 --> 00:12:29,805
She is gonna hate me!

242
00:12:29,805 --> 00:12:31,289
Yeah, well....

243
00:12:38,398 --> 00:12:39,797
Will you pick one?

244
00:12:39,797 --> 00:12:41,196
Just pick one.

245
00:12:41,234 --> 00:12:43,230
Here, how about that one?

246
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,226
That's patio furniture.

247
00:12:45,405 --> 00:12:47,822
So what? Like people will come in

248
00:12:47,822 --> 00:12:50,239
and think, ''Oh, I'm outside again.''

249
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,299
Fine.

250
00:12:52,212 --> 00:12:53,338
What about the birds?

251
00:12:54,514 --> 00:12:56,965
l don't know. They don't say,

252
00:12:56,965 --> 00:12:59,416
''Hello, sit here. Eat something.''

253
00:13:00,387 --> 00:13:01,883
You pick one.

254
00:13:01,883 --> 00:13:03,379
Okay. How about the ladybugs?

255
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:06,221
Forget about the birds, but big red

256
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:08,251
insects suggest fine dining.

257
00:13:08,361 --> 00:13:10,409
Fine! Want the birds? Get the birds!

258
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:12,457
Not like that, l won't.

259
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:18,262
Kip would have liked the birds.

260
00:13:29,216 --> 00:13:30,211
Hi, Pheebs.

261
00:13:30,211 --> 00:13:31,206
What's going on?

262
00:13:31,284 --> 00:13:33,235
Are you moving out?

263
00:13:33,235 --> 00:13:35,186
I'm getting ready for the weekend.

264
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:37,839
Are your weekends longer

265
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,289
than two days?

266
00:13:40,227 --> 00:13:42,195
These aren't all my suitcases.

267
00:13:42,295 --> 00:13:43,387
This one's Paolo's.

268
00:13:47,234 --> 00:13:49,213
Rachel, can we talk for a sec?

269
00:13:49,213 --> 00:13:51,192
Well, sure.

270
00:13:51,238 --> 00:13:53,399
Just for a sec, Paolo's on his way.

271
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:08,348
We haven't known each other that long.

272
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:09,838
There are three things

273
00:14:09,838 --> 00:14:11,288
you should know:

274
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:13,791
One, my friends are the most

275
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:16,191
important thing in my life.

276
00:14:16,296 --> 00:14:18,264
Two, l never lie.

277
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,229
And three, l make the best

278
00:14:21,229 --> 00:14:23,259
oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.

279
00:14:25,372 --> 00:14:28,307
Okay. Thanks, Pheebs.

280
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,796
Oh, my God!

281
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:36,212
l know.

282
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:38,375
Why have l never tasted these?

283
00:14:38,418 --> 00:14:40,898
l don't make them a lot, because

284
00:14:40,898 --> 00:14:43,378
it's not fair to the other cookies.

285
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:50,925
These are the best

286
00:14:50,925 --> 00:14:52,421
oatmeal raisin cookies.

287
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:54,814
Which proves that l never lie.

288
00:14:54,814 --> 00:14:56,395
l guess you don't.

289
00:14:57,304 --> 00:14:59,397
Paolo made a pass at me.

290
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:03,234
What do you think?

291
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:04,760
It's the most beautiful table

292
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,244
I've seen.

293
00:15:06,346 --> 00:15:07,335
l know.

294
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:09,245
Will you balance plates

295
00:15:09,245 --> 00:15:10,342
on these heads?

296
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:12,248
Who cares? We'll eat at the sink.

297
00:15:12,248 --> 00:15:13,345
Come on!

298
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:17,248
Heads up, Ross.

299
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:19,450
Score! You suck!

300
00:15:23,196 --> 00:15:24,254
Are you okay?

301
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,392
l need some milk.

302
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,361
Okay. I've got milk.

303
00:15:37,377 --> 00:15:39,174
Here you go.

304
00:15:47,387 --> 00:15:49,184
Better?

305
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,414
No.

306
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:56,842
l feel so stupid! l think about

307
00:15:56,842 --> 00:15:59,390
the other day with you guys.

308
00:15:59,432 --> 00:16:01,332
And l was all, ''Oh, Paolo!

309
00:16:01,332 --> 00:16:03,232
He's so great!

310
00:16:03,336 --> 00:16:05,236
He makes me feel so--''

311
00:16:06,172 --> 00:16:07,230
God!

312
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:09,267
I'm so embarrassed!

313
00:16:09,376 --> 00:16:11,241
I'm so embarrassed.

314
00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:13,244
I'm the one he hit on.

315
00:16:13,244 --> 00:16:15,144
l unleashed him on you.

316
00:16:15,181 --> 00:16:17,149
If l had never met him--

317
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,245
I'm so sorry.

318
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:19,240
No, I'm sorry.

319
00:16:19,352 --> 00:16:20,364
I'm sorry.

320
00:16:20,364 --> 00:16:21,376
I'm sorry. Wait.

321
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:23,268
What are we sorry about?

322
00:16:23,268 --> 00:16:24,348
l don't know.

323
00:16:24,457 --> 00:16:26,391
Right. He's the pig.

324
00:16:27,193 --> 00:16:28,290
Such a pig!

325
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,387
Oh, God, he's such a pig!

326
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:33,291
He's like a big disgusting pig....

327
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,782
Pig man!

328
00:16:34,782 --> 00:16:36,164
Yes, good!

329
00:16:40,273 --> 00:16:43,265
But he was my pig man!

330
00:16:44,377 --> 00:16:46,368
How did l not see this?

331
00:16:48,281 --> 00:16:49,305
Oh, l know!

332
00:16:52,385 --> 00:16:56,184
Because he's gorgeous.

334
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:57,415
And he's charming.

335
00:16:58,224 --> 00:16:59,287
And when he looks--

336
00:16:59,287 --> 00:17:00,350
Okay, Pheebs.

337
00:17:01,127 --> 00:17:02,253
The end.

338
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:06,120
God.

339
00:17:08,134 --> 00:17:10,125
Should l not have told you?

340
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:12,270
Trust me, it's much better

341
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,170
that l know.

342
00:17:17,277 --> 00:17:19,256
But l just liked it better before.

343
00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:21,235
It was better.

344
00:17:38,198 --> 00:17:40,177
She took it pretty well.

345
00:17:40,177 --> 00:17:42,156
Paolo's over there now, so....

346
00:17:42,302 --> 00:17:44,332
We should go and see if she's okay.

347
00:17:44,332 --> 00:17:46,362
Just one second.

348
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,254
Score!

349
00:17:49,254 --> 00:17:50,300
Game! Nice!

350
00:17:52,412 --> 00:17:54,175
Come on, Pheebs.

351
00:17:55,382 --> 00:17:56,878
Well, it looks like we

352
00:17:56,878 --> 00:17:58,374
kicked your butts.

353
00:17:58,418 --> 00:18:00,767
She did. You could be on the Olympic

354
00:18:00,767 --> 00:18:03,116
''Standing There'' team.

355
00:18:03,156 --> 00:18:04,248
Come on. Two on one.

356
00:18:04,357 --> 00:18:05,790
Why are you here?

357
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,223
She just broke up with him.

358
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:09,420
It's time for you to swoop in.

359
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,780
What, now?

360
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,230
Yes. Now is when you swoop.

361
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:15,245
When Paolo walks out,

362
00:18:15,245 --> 00:18:17,224
you gotta be the first guy she sees.

363
00:18:17,337 --> 00:18:19,788
She's gotta know you're everything

364
00:18:19,788 --> 00:18:22,239
he's not. You're the anti-Paolo.

365
00:18:24,177 --> 00:18:26,145
My Catholic friend is right.

366
00:18:26,246 --> 00:18:27,309
She's distraught.

367
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:28,372
You're there for her.

368
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,765
You pick up the pieces and then

369
00:18:31,765 --> 00:18:34,381
you usher in ''The Age of Ross.''

370
00:18:41,361 --> 00:18:42,811
See this? See?

371
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:44,261
Hold it! Ascolta!

372
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:48,362
How's it going?

373
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:49,357
Don't stare.

374
00:18:49,402 --> 00:18:51,882
She threw his clothes off the balcony.

375
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:54,362
Now there's gesturing and arm-waving.

376
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,739
That is, ''How could you?''

377
00:18:56,739 --> 00:18:58,303
or ''Enormous breasts!''

378
00:19:00,313 --> 00:19:02,213
Here he comes.

379
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:16,158
l am to say goodbye.

381
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:18,160
Okay, bye-bye.

382
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:24,235
Paolo, l really hate you for what you

383
00:19:24,235 --> 00:19:28,657
did, but l still have five of these so heat it at 75

385
00:19:28,657 --> 00:19:30,141
until the cheese bubbles.

386
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,877
l just wanna tell you, and l think

387
00:19:36,877 --> 00:19:39,374
I'd speak for everyone when l say....

388
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:48,193
Oh, just look at her.

389
00:19:48,294 --> 00:19:49,374
Guys, l think only one of us

390
00:19:49,374 --> 00:19:52,243
should go so she's not overwhelmed.

392
00:19:52,243 --> 00:19:53,289
Right.

393
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:56,199
And l really think it should be me.

394
00:20:13,186 --> 00:20:14,278
You all right?

395
00:20:15,288 --> 00:20:17,222
I've been better.

396
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:20,292
l don't believe this.

397
00:20:21,227 --> 00:20:22,723
l wasn't supposed to care

398
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:24,219
about this guy.

399
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:26,748
It was just supposed to be

400
00:20:26,748 --> 00:20:29,199
this big, fun, ltalian thing.

401
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:31,915
Someday l could look back and say,

402
00:20:31,915 --> 00:20:34,395
''That was a big, fun, ltalian thing.''

403
00:20:36,242 --> 00:20:37,840
It wasn't supposed to feel

404
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,438
like this when it was over.

405
00:20:42,315 --> 00:20:43,339
Come here.

406
00:20:50,423 --> 00:20:53,821
Listen you deserve

408
00:20:53,821 --> 00:20:55,317
so much better than him.

409
00:20:55,428 --> 00:21:00,199
l mean, you should be with a guy who knows

411
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:02,167
what he has when he has you.

412
00:21:05,405 --> 00:21:06,394
What?

413
00:21:07,407 --> 00:21:10,308
I'm so sick of guys!

414
00:21:11,277 --> 00:21:13,342
l don't want to look at

415
00:21:13,342 --> 00:21:15,407
or think about another guy.

416
00:21:16,216 --> 00:21:17,712
l don't even want

417
00:21:17,712 --> 00:21:19,208
to be near another guy.

418
00:21:26,226 --> 00:21:28,421
Ross, you're so great.

419
00:21:40,306 --> 00:21:41,352
Are you all right?

420
00:21:41,352 --> 00:21:42,398
Are you okay?

421
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:44,807
Medium. Any cookies left?

422
00:21:44,807 --> 00:21:46,405
Yeah.

423
00:21:49,449 --> 00:21:53,365
See, Rach l don't think swearing off guys

425
00:21:53,365 --> 00:21:55,413
altogether is the answer.

426
00:21:56,222 --> 00:21:58,235
What you need is to develop a more

427
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:00,248
sophisticated screening process.

428
00:22:02,262 --> 00:22:03,359
l just need to be by myself

429
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:04,456
for a while.

430
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,779
l just gotta figure out what l want.

431
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:08,360
No, no.

432
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,337
See, because not all guys out there

433
00:22:11,337 --> 00:22:13,305
are gonna be a Paolo.

434
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,364
No, l know. l know.

435
00:22:15,408 --> 00:22:17,791
And I'm sure your little boy's

436
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:20,174
not gonna grow up to be one.

437
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,175
What?

438
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:23,170
What?

439
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,182
I'm having a boy?

440
00:22:28,187 --> 00:22:29,313
No.

441
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:33,384
No. In fact, you're not having a boy.

442
00:22:34,294 --> 00:22:36,194
I'm having a boy.

443
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,348
Huh? Am l having a boy?

444
00:22:39,348 --> 00:22:41,299
You're having a boy!

445
00:22:41,434 --> 00:22:43,197
I'm having a boy!

446
00:22:43,303 --> 00:22:44,298
I'm having a boy!

447
00:22:44,298 --> 00:22:45,293
What is it?

448
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,821
I'm having a boy!

449
00:22:46,821 --> 00:22:48,237
I'm having a boy!

450
00:22:52,211 --> 00:22:53,405
We already knew that!

451
00:22:57,216 --> 00:22:58,410
I'm having a son.

452
00:23:06,392 --> 00:23:09,293
Yes! And that would be a shutdown!

453
00:23:09,362 --> 00:23:10,386
Shutout!

454
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:17,168
Where you going? One more game!

455
00:23:17,203 --> 00:23:18,733
It's 2:0 in the morning.

456
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:20,263
Yeah, get out!

457
00:23:20,473 --> 00:23:21,940
You guys always hang out

458
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,407
in my apartment.

459
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,303
l'll only use my left hand.

460
00:23:26,412 --> 00:23:28,380
Come on, wussies!

461
00:23:32,385 --> 00:23:34,410
All right! Okay! l gotta go!

462
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,312
I'm going.

463
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,282
And I'm gone.

464
00:23:41,227 --> 00:23:42,211
One more game?

465
00:23:42,211 --> 00:23:43,195
Oh, yeah.
