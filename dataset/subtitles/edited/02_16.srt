1
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,308
This is weird. Ever notice Cap'n

2
00:00:06,308 --> 00:00:08,356
Crunch's eyebrows are on his hat?

3
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:11,411
That's weird? The man's been captain

4
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:14,391
of a cereal for the last 40 years.

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,329
What?

6
00:00:18,407 --> 00:00:19,857
The spoon!

7
00:00:19,857 --> 00:00:21,307
You licked and you put.

8
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:26,244
You licked and you put.

9
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:27,407
Yeah, so?

10
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,930
Don't you see how gross that is?

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,410
It's like you using my toothbrush.

12
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:35,322
You used my toothbrush!

13
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:38,221
Only because I used the red one

14
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:40,217
to unclog the drain.

15
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:43,262
Mine is the red one!

16
00:00:43,332 --> 00:00:45,846
Oh, God!

17
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:48,360
Can open. Worms everywhere!

18
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:51,303
Why can't we use the same toothbrush,

19
00:00:51,303 --> 00:00:53,368
but we can use the same soap?

20
00:00:53,476 --> 00:00:55,427
Because soap is soap.

21
00:00:55,427 --> 00:00:57,378
It's self-cleaning.

22
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:02,750
Next time you shower think about the last thing I wash

23
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,218
and the first thing you wash.

24
00:01:55,371 --> 00:01:57,401
Look at you fancy lads!

25
00:01:57,401 --> 00:01:59,431
What's the occasion?

26
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:01,323
You know that guy on my show

27
00:02:01,323 --> 00:02:03,171
that's in a coma?

28
00:02:03,312 --> 00:02:05,371
He's having a brunch.

29
00:02:06,315 --> 00:02:07,748
Ready when you are.

30
00:02:07,748 --> 00:02:09,181
Okey-doke.

31
00:02:09,285 --> 00:02:10,735
I can't believe

32
00:02:10,735 --> 00:02:12,185
you're getting tattoos.

33
00:02:12,221 --> 00:02:14,189
You guys are getting tattoos?

34
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,837
Yes, but you cannot tell Ross.

35
00:02:15,837 --> 00:02:17,384
I wanna surprise him.

36
00:02:18,194 --> 00:02:19,291
Wow, this is wild!

37
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:20,388
What are you gonna get?

38
00:02:21,297 --> 00:02:23,390
I'm getting a lily.

39
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:27,225
For my mom, because her name's Lily.

40
00:02:27,436 --> 00:02:29,819
That's lucky. What if her name

41
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,202
was Big Ugly Splotch?

42
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:34,272
Where you getting it?

43
00:02:34,272 --> 00:02:35,335
My shoulder.

44
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:36,907
What?

45
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,403
What's on your shoulder?

46
00:02:39,215 --> 00:02:41,206
A chip.

47
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:45,420
I've got a big attitude problem.

48
00:02:46,322 --> 00:02:47,818
A tattoo. I'm getting a tattoo.

49
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:49,314
A tattoo?

50
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:52,417
Why? Why would you wanna do that?

51
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:55,442
You don't think they're kind of cool?

52
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,455
No. Sorry, I don't.

53
00:02:58,234 --> 00:02:59,718
Why would anyone pay

54
00:02:59,718 --> 00:03:01,202
to scar their body for life?

55
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,363
What if it doesn't come out right?

56
00:03:03,405 --> 00:03:05,339
It's like having a bad haircut

57
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:07,273
all the time.

58
00:03:08,377 --> 00:03:11,210
Why is everyone staring at me?

59
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,793
Sign this card for Dad.

60
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,306
Richard will be here soon.

61
00:03:14,383 --> 00:03:16,334
He's going to the party?

62
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:18,285
He's my parents' best friend.

63
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:19,934
So is today the day

64
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:21,481
you tell them about you two?

65
00:03:22,224 --> 00:03:24,306
Yeah, for my dad's birthday,

66
00:03:24,306 --> 00:03:26,388
I decided to give him a stroke.

67
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:29,322
No, I think you should tell them.

68
00:03:29,398 --> 00:03:31,298
I don't know how serious he is.

69
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:33,198
Until I do, I say nothing.

70
00:03:33,302 --> 00:03:34,348
I don't think

71
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:35,394
Mom and Dad would mind.

72
00:03:35,437 --> 00:03:37,371
Remember when you were 9

73
00:03:37,371 --> 00:03:39,305
and Richard was 30, Dad said:

74
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:41,502
''God, I hope they get together.''

75
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:47,343
Hello?

76
00:03:47,343 --> 00:03:48,338
-I'm double-parked.

77
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:50,248
Okay. Come on, Ross.

78
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:54,888
Bye, you.

79
00:03:54,888 --> 00:03:56,321
Bye.

80
00:04:01,363 --> 00:04:03,354
Bye, you.

81
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:15,926
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go.

82
00:04:15,926 --> 00:04:18,377
Okay, wait, wait.

83
00:04:19,381 --> 00:04:21,281
It's gonna be fine.

84
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:23,181
Are you not nervous?

85
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:24,817
I'm terrified.

86
00:04:24,817 --> 00:04:26,415
This is just a very absorbent suit.

87
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:28,184
Shall we?

88
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,179
Yes.

89
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:30,419
No. You know what?

90
00:04:31,193 --> 00:04:32,740
Ross, let's switch places.

91
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,287
Get in the middle.

92
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,877
This looks like we're trying

93
00:04:35,877 --> 00:04:37,424
to cover something up.

94
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,248
You could come in straddling him,

95
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:42,296
they still wouldn't believe it.

96
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,298
We're here!

97
00:04:45,407 --> 00:04:48,399
Hi, kids! Hi, darling!

98
00:04:48,444 --> 00:04:49,928
Happy birthday, Dad.

99
00:04:49,928 --> 00:04:51,412
Thank you.

100
00:04:51,447 --> 00:04:52,436
Happy birthday!

101
00:04:53,215 --> 00:04:54,312
You kids thanked

102
00:04:54,312 --> 00:04:55,409
Dr. Burke for the ride?

103
00:04:55,451 --> 00:04:57,851
Actually, Mom, I think Monica

104
00:04:57,851 --> 00:05:00,251
thanked him for the both of us.

105
00:05:01,257 --> 00:05:03,248
So you kids take the train in?

106
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,192
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.

107
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:09,260
Speaking of whom, I hear he's got

108
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,258
some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.

109
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:17,839
Finger cramp! Oh, God!

110
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,307
Sorry. Here, let me get that, Mom.

111
00:05:20,376 --> 00:05:22,890
So Richard's shopping

112
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,404
in the junior section?

113
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:27,375
Are we still on that?

114
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:29,412
You just know she's got

115
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,408
the IQ of a napkin.

116
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:34,178
She's probably not even pretty.

117
00:05:34,223 --> 00:05:36,202
Just young enough so that

118
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,181
everything is still pointing up.

119
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:47,301
Can you believe this?

120
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:49,201
It's a great apartment.

121
00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:50,801
In the bathroom,

122
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:52,297
there's mirrors on both sides.

123
00:05:52,408 --> 00:05:55,400
It's like peeing with the Rockettes.

124
00:05:56,245 --> 00:05:59,214
Well, there's my fantasy come true.

125
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:01,249
No, seriously.

126
00:06:02,284 --> 00:06:04,314
We were just saying, great apartment!

127
00:06:04,314 --> 00:06:06,344
Thanks. You want it?

128
00:06:06,388 --> 00:06:08,322
I'm moving to a bigger place.

129
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:10,256
You should take this one.

130
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,673
Can you see me in a place like this?

131
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,186
Why not?

132
00:06:14,263 --> 00:06:16,760
You hate park views and high ceilings?

133
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,257
Come on, I'll show you the kitchen.

134
00:06:20,302 --> 00:06:21,752
That's okay,

135
00:06:21,752 --> 00:06:23,202
I saw a kitchen this morning.

136
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:24,836
On TV.

137
00:06:24,836 --> 00:06:26,400
Stop talking. Okay!

138
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,256
Come on, tell us!

139
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,302
Is she really 20?

140
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:32,370
I am not telling you anything.

141
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:34,381
Come on, it's my birthday.

142
00:06:34,381 --> 00:06:36,281
Let me live vicariously!

143
00:06:36,318 --> 00:06:38,309
You don't want to do that.

144
00:06:38,387 --> 00:06:39,883
What's a little midlife crisis

145
00:06:39,883 --> 00:06:41,379
between friends?

146
00:06:41,423 --> 00:06:42,822
Let it go.

147
00:06:42,822 --> 00:06:44,221
I know what it's like.

148
00:06:44,293 --> 00:06:46,858
When I turned 50, I got the Porsche.

149
00:06:46,858 --> 00:06:49,423
You got your own little speedster.

150
00:06:50,232 --> 00:06:51,779
Seriously, it's not like that.

151
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,326
Tell you what.

152
00:06:53,402 --> 00:06:55,319
Maybe one weekend

153
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,236
you can borrow the car and I could--

154
00:06:57,306 --> 00:06:58,403
I beg you not

155
00:06:58,403 --> 00:06:59,500
to finish that sentence!

156
00:07:00,175 --> 00:07:02,143
What? I'm kidding!

157
00:07:02,244 --> 00:07:03,791
You know I'd never let him

158
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,338
touch the Porsche.

159
00:07:12,354 --> 00:07:14,805
Okay, Rach. Which lily?

160
00:07:14,805 --> 00:07:17,256
This lily or that lily?

161
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,206
Well, I--

162
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:20,252
I like this lily.

163
00:07:20,295 --> 00:07:22,877
It's more open. That's like my mom.

164
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:25,459
She had a more open, giving spirit.

165
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:28,293
Foghorn Leghorn!

166
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:32,340
Blond girl? You're in room two.

167
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,275
Not-so-blond girl, you're with me.

168
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,278
Here we go!

169
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:40,181
You're not going.

170
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:43,231
Is this because of what Ross said?

171
00:07:43,231 --> 00:07:45,279
No.

172
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:46,871
Well, yeah, maybe.

173
00:07:46,871 --> 00:07:48,321
I don't believe this.

174
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,858
Is this how this relationship is

175
00:07:50,858 --> 00:07:53,326
gonna work? Ross equals boss?

176
00:07:53,395 --> 00:07:56,193
Come on, what is this, 1 922?

177
00:07:56,331 --> 00:07:58,196
What's 1 922?

178
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,131
Just, you know, a long time ago.

179
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:03,801
When men used to tell women

180
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:05,331
what to do a lot.

181
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:08,137
Then there was suffrage, which

182
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:10,133
was good. But it sounds horrible.

183
00:08:13,148 --> 00:08:14,746
Do you want this tattoo?

184
00:08:14,746 --> 00:08:16,344
I do. It's just that Ross--

185
00:08:16,385 --> 00:08:18,768
Okay, hey!

186
00:08:18,768 --> 00:08:21,151
Is your boyfriend the boss of you?

187
00:08:21,356 --> 00:08:22,823
No.

188
00:08:22,823 --> 00:08:24,290
Okay, who is the boss of you?

189
00:08:26,161 --> 00:08:27,253
You?

190
00:08:28,163 --> 00:08:30,393
No! You are the boss of you!

191
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,714
You march in there and get

192
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:36,262
that heart tattooed on your hip! Go!

193
00:08:39,274 --> 00:08:41,242
I haven't even gotten my tattoo

194
00:08:41,242 --> 00:08:43,210
and I'm already tougher.

195
00:08:48,183 --> 00:08:49,207
How you doing?

196
00:08:49,284 --> 00:08:51,377
I'm a twinkie!

197
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:54,417
Really? I'm a hero.

198
00:08:57,192 --> 00:08:58,420
This is so hard.

199
00:08:59,194 --> 00:09:02,163
Yeah, I know. I hate it too.

200
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:05,132
Look, maybe we should just tell them.

201
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:06,730
Maybe we should just tell

202
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,226
your parents first.

203
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,170
My parents are dead.

204
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,175
God, you are so lucky!

205
00:09:15,244 --> 00:09:16,694
I mean-- You know what I mean.

206
00:09:16,694 --> 00:09:18,144
I know.

207
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:20,340
Just hang in there, okay?

208
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:22,765
Okay, I'll go out first, all right?

209
00:09:22,765 --> 00:09:25,148
All right.

210
00:09:29,157 --> 00:09:30,704
Judy! Going to the bathroom.

211
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,251
Good for you!

212
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:37,379
Thank you, Richard.

213
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:39,461
I appreciate the support.

214
00:09:43,272 --> 00:09:45,769
Honey. Seen my Harmon Killebrew bat?

215
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:48,266
Bob won't believe I have one.

216
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,175
I have no idea.

217
00:09:50,312 --> 00:09:52,246
Did you know Richard

218
00:09:52,246 --> 00:09:54,180
has a twinkie in the city?

219
00:09:54,283 --> 00:09:56,331
I know. He's like a new man.

220
00:09:56,331 --> 00:09:58,379
It's like a scene from Cocoon.

221
00:09:59,187 --> 00:10:00,734
I never would have pictured

222
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,281
Richard with a bimbo.

223
00:10:02,324 --> 00:10:04,275
He told Johnny Shapiro

224
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:06,226
that she's quite a girl.

225
00:10:06,295 --> 00:10:09,196
He said he's falling in love with her.

226
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:10,748
Really?

227
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:12,198
I've never seen him this happy.

228
00:10:12,234 --> 00:10:14,316
So, Jack. Ever think about trading

229
00:10:14,316 --> 00:10:16,398
me in for a younger model?

230
00:10:16,505 --> 00:10:19,201
Of course not.

231
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:21,304
With you, it's like

232
00:10:21,304 --> 00:10:23,300
I've got two 25-year-olds.

233
00:10:26,315 --> 00:10:28,215
Oh, Jack, stop!

234
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,218
Come on!

235
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:33,445
It's my birthday!

236
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:39,389
Can we drop this? I am not

237
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,419
interested in the guy's apartment.

238
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,981
Please. I saw the way you were

239
00:10:43,981 --> 00:10:46,432
checking out his moldings. You want it.

240
00:10:46,535 --> 00:10:48,952
Why would I want another apartment?

241
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:51,369
I've already got one I love.

242
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,340
It wouldn't kill you

243
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,240
to say it once in a while.

244
00:10:57,446 --> 00:10:59,880
All right. You want the truth?

245
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,314
I'm thinking about it.

246
00:11:02,384 --> 00:11:03,334
What?

247
00:11:03,334 --> 00:11:04,284
I'm sorry.

248
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,349
I'm 28. I've never lived alone

249
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:10,874
and I'm finally at a place where I got enough money

250
00:11:10,874 --> 00:11:13,325
that I don't need a roommate anymore.

251
00:11:13,395 --> 00:11:15,863
I don't need a roommate either.

252
00:11:15,863 --> 00:11:18,331
I can afford to live here by myself.

253
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,800
I may have to bring in somebody

254
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,200
every week to lick the silverware.

255
00:11:23,305 --> 00:11:25,802
Why are you so bent out of shape? We

256
00:11:25,802 --> 00:11:28,299
didn't agree to live together forever.

257
00:11:28,343 --> 00:11:30,436
We're not Bert and Ernie.

258
00:11:32,314 --> 00:11:34,362
I'm aware that we're not

259
00:11:34,362 --> 00:11:36,410
gay puppets, all right?

260
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:38,343
You know what?

261
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,871
If this is the way you feel,

262
00:11:40,871 --> 00:11:43,322
then maybe you should take it.

263
00:11:43,358 --> 00:11:44,387
That's how I feel.

264
00:11:44,387 --> 00:11:45,416
Then take it!

265
00:11:46,228 --> 00:11:46,774
Maybe I will!

266
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:47,320
Fine!

267
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:50,427
Great! You can spend more time

268
00:11:50,427 --> 00:11:53,425
with your real friends, the spoons!

269
00:11:54,336 --> 00:11:57,237
Whose drink can I freshen?

270
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,367
Almost time for cake!

271
00:12:10,385 --> 00:12:12,285
Mon, are you okay?

272
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,350
You remember that video

273
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,380
I found of Mom and Dad?

274
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:19,422
Well, I just caught the live show.

275
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,212
Hey, there.

276
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,224
What?

277
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:29,415
Nothing. I just heard

278
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,394
something nice about you.

279
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:34,204
Really?

280
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:35,333
Richard?

281
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,878
Your son isn't seeing anyone, is he?

282
00:12:37,878 --> 00:12:40,346
Not that I know of.

283
00:12:40,415 --> 00:12:42,912
I was thinking, why doesn't

284
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:45,409
he give Monica a call?

285
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:49,424
That's an idea.

286
00:12:49,524 --> 00:12:51,372
Well, actually,

287
00:12:51,372 --> 00:12:53,220
I'm already seeing someone.

288
00:12:53,328 --> 00:12:54,317
Oh?

289
00:12:58,366 --> 00:13:00,766
She never tells us anything. Ross, did

290
00:13:00,766 --> 00:13:03,166
you know she's seeing someone?

291
00:13:03,205 --> 00:13:04,837
Mom, there are

292
00:13:04,837 --> 00:13:06,469
so many people in my life.

293
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:09,706
Some of them are seeing people

294
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,203
and some aren't. Is that crystal?

295
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:16,284
So who's the mystery man?

296
00:13:17,185 --> 00:13:19,278
Well, he's a doctor.

297
00:13:19,387 --> 00:13:21,184
A real doctor?

298
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:23,382
No, a doctor of meat.

299
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:26,243
Of course he's a real doctor.

300
00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:28,194
And he's handsome.

301
00:13:29,197 --> 00:13:30,294
And he's sweet,

302
00:13:30,294 --> 00:13:31,391
and I know you'd like him.

303
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,497
Well, that's wonderful.

304
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,199
Mom, it's okay.

305
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,407
It is, Judy.

306
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:44,504
Jack!

307
00:13:46,448 --> 00:13:48,831
Could you come in here for a moment?

308
00:13:48,831 --> 00:13:51,214
Now!

309
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,420
Found it!

310
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,320
I'll take that, Dad.

311
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,308
It seems your daughter and Richard

312
00:14:00,308 --> 00:14:02,356
are something of an item.

313
00:14:03,265 --> 00:14:05,216
That's impossible.

314
00:14:05,216 --> 00:14:07,167
He's got a twinkie in the city.

315
00:14:07,402 --> 00:14:09,199
I'm the twinkie.

316
00:14:09,404 --> 00:14:10,433
You are?

317
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:11,462
She's not a twinkie!

318
00:14:12,307 --> 00:14:13,837
Look, this is the best relationship

319
00:14:13,837 --> 00:14:15,367
I've been in--

320
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,174
Oh, please! A relationship?

321
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,248
Yes, a relationship!

322
00:14:20,248 --> 00:14:22,216
I am crazy about this man.

323
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:23,813
Really?

324
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:25,309
Yes.

325
00:14:25,387 --> 00:14:27,400
Am I supposed to stand here

326
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,413
and listen to this on my birthday?

327
00:14:30,192 --> 00:14:32,240
This is a good thing. You said

328
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,288
you've never seen Richard happier.

329
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:35,318
When?

330
00:14:35,397 --> 00:14:37,445
Upstairs in the bathroom,

331
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:39,493
right before you felt up Mom!

332
00:14:57,319 --> 00:14:58,832
It looks so good!

333
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:00,345
Oh, I love it.

334
00:15:00,388 --> 00:15:02,271
I know, so do I.

335
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:04,154
I'm so glad you made me do this.

336
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:06,352
Okay, let me see yours.

337
00:15:09,264 --> 00:15:11,289
Let's see yours again.

338
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:14,280
We just saw mine. Let me see yours.

339
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,293
Oh, okay.

340
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:19,269
Oh, no!

341
00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:22,856
It's gone! That's so weird.

342
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:25,404
I don't know where it went.

343
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:29,246
You didn't get it?

344
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:30,309
No.

345
00:15:30,485 --> 00:15:31,901
Why not?

346
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:33,317
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

347
00:15:33,388 --> 00:15:34,838
How could you do this?

348
00:15:34,838 --> 00:15:36,288
This was your idea!

349
00:15:36,324 --> 00:15:38,320
I know! I was gonna get it,

350
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,316
but he came in with this needle.

351
00:15:40,395 --> 00:15:42,295
Did you know

352
00:15:42,295 --> 00:15:44,195
they do this with needles?

353
00:15:44,232 --> 00:15:46,200
Really? You don't say?

354
00:15:46,234 --> 00:15:49,397
Because mine was licked on by kittens!

355
00:15:50,305 --> 00:15:51,852
I'm sorry.

356
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:53,399
Seriously, does it hurt a lot?

357
00:15:53,441 --> 00:15:57,241
No, it's just a pinch. Like that--

358
00:15:57,312 --> 00:15:59,212
Oh, my God!

359
00:16:00,181 --> 00:16:01,762
That really hurt me!

360
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:03,343
Oh, that's gonna leave a mark.

361
00:16:08,356 --> 00:16:10,187
I'm sorry about what--

362
00:16:10,258 --> 00:16:11,725
Yeah, me too.

363
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:13,192
I know.

364
00:16:15,397 --> 00:16:18,264
So do we need to hug here?

365
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,393
No, we're all right.

366
00:16:22,203 --> 00:16:24,171
So I got you something.

367
00:16:25,173 --> 00:16:26,265
Plastic spoons!

368
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,293
Great!

369
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:32,176
Lick away, my man.

370
00:16:32,314 --> 00:16:34,362
These will go great in my new place,

371
00:16:34,362 --> 00:16:36,410
till I get real ones.

372
00:16:37,185 --> 00:16:38,277
What?

373
00:16:38,386 --> 00:16:40,382
I can't use these forever.

374
00:16:40,382 --> 00:16:42,378
They're no friend of the environment.

375
00:16:43,224 --> 00:16:44,720
No, I mean what's this

376
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,216
about your new place?

377
00:16:46,428 --> 00:16:48,879
I'm moving out, like we talked about.

378
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:51,330
I didn't think that was serious.

379
00:16:52,434 --> 00:16:55,335
I thought that was just a fight.

380
00:16:55,403 --> 00:16:57,416
Well, it was a fight.

381
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,429
Based on serious stuff, remember?

382
00:17:00,175 --> 00:17:02,166
About how I never lived alone?

383
00:17:02,243 --> 00:17:03,807
I think it would be good for me.

384
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:07,375
Help me to grow or whatever.

385
00:17:11,186 --> 00:17:13,279
Well, there you go.

386
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:16,369
Are you cool with this?

387
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,382
I don't wanna leave you high and dry.

388
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,152
I've never been lower or wetter.

389
00:17:23,298 --> 00:17:25,277
I'll be fine. I'll just turn

390
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,256
your bedroom into a game room.

391
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:30,202
Put the foosball table in there.

392
00:17:31,373 --> 00:17:34,240
Why do you get to keep the table?

393
00:17:36,311 --> 00:17:38,472
I did pay for half of it.

394
00:17:41,383 --> 00:17:43,897
And I paid for the other half.

395
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,411
All right, I'll play you for it.

396
00:17:47,188 --> 00:17:48,280
All right, you're on.

397
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,341
I can take two minutes

398
00:17:50,341 --> 00:17:52,292
out of my day to kick your ass.

399
00:17:52,494 --> 00:17:54,462
Your men will get scored on

400
00:17:54,462 --> 00:17:56,430
more times than your sister.

401
00:18:03,438 --> 00:18:05,235
Which sister?

402
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:11,209
So are you sorry that I told them?

403
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:13,327
No. It's been a long time

404
00:18:13,327 --> 00:18:15,375
since your dad and I went running.

405
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:20,382
Did you get it?

406
00:18:20,382 --> 00:18:21,377
Is Ross here?

407
00:18:22,157 --> 00:18:23,670
He went out for pizza.

408
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,183
Okay, really quick.

409
00:18:26,294 --> 00:18:27,727
That's great!

410
00:18:27,727 --> 00:18:29,160
Very tasteful.

411
00:18:30,165 --> 00:18:31,160
Wanna see mine?

412
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,155
Yes.

413
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,168
What? You didn't get one.

414
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:37,261
Okay. Well then, what is this?

415
00:18:39,174 --> 00:18:41,199
What are we looking at?

416
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:43,402
That blue freckle?

417
00:18:44,412 --> 00:18:46,209
That's my tattoo.

418
00:18:46,281 --> 00:18:47,731
That is not a tattoo.

419
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:49,181
That is a nothing.

420
00:18:49,317 --> 00:18:50,813
I got her in the chair,

421
00:18:50,813 --> 00:18:55,185
he barely touched her she screamed and that was it.

422
00:18:55,223 --> 00:18:57,191
Okay, hi!

423
00:18:58,426 --> 00:19:00,792
For your information,

424
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:03,158
this is exactly what I wanted.

425
00:19:03,231 --> 00:19:05,779
This is a tattoo of the Earth as seen

426
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:08,327
from a great, great distance.

427
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,751
It's the way my mother

428
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:12,332
sees me from heaven.

429
00:19:12,373 --> 00:19:15,274
Oh, what a load of crap!

430
00:19:17,145 --> 00:19:18,271
That is a dot!

431
00:19:18,346 --> 00:19:20,814
Your mother's in heaven going,

432
00:19:20,814 --> 00:19:23,282
''Where the hell's my lily, you wuss?!''

433
00:19:24,352 --> 00:19:27,270
Okay? That is not a tattoo!

434
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,188
This is a tattoo!

435
00:19:33,161 --> 00:19:34,355
You got a tattoo?

436
00:19:36,164 --> 00:19:37,256
Maybe.

437
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:39,829
But just a little one.

438
00:19:39,829 --> 00:19:41,359
Phoebe got the whole world!

439
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:45,296
Well, let me see.

440
00:19:48,276 --> 00:19:49,402
Well?

441
00:19:50,178 --> 00:19:54,374
Well, it's really...sexy.

442
00:19:54,415 --> 00:19:56,298
I wouldn't have thought

443
00:19:56,298 --> 00:19:59,379
it would be, but wow!

444
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,803
Really?

445
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:06,889
Yeah. So is it sore?

446
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:08,385
Or can you do stuff?

447
00:20:11,332 --> 00:20:13,232
I guess.

448
00:20:13,301 --> 00:20:15,428
Save us some pizza.

449
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:23,504
Get it out of the corner!

450
00:20:24,412 --> 00:20:25,401
Pass it! Pass it!

451
00:20:26,314 --> 00:20:28,305
Stop talking to your men!

452
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:33,352
And the table is mine.

453
00:20:36,424 --> 00:20:39,222
Congratulations.

454
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:53,332
You guys will still visit, right?

455
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:55,858
Oh, yeah. You got the big TV.

456
00:20:55,858 --> 00:20:58,275
We'll be over there all the time.

457
00:20:58,379 --> 00:21:00,370
Except when we are here.

458
00:21:05,286 --> 00:21:07,237
I know you're just moving uptown,

459
00:21:07,237 --> 00:21:09,188
but I'll miss you.

460
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,383
How can you not be across the hall?

461
00:21:12,193 --> 00:21:14,189
Who's gonna eat all our food

462
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,185
and tie up our phone lines--?

463
00:21:16,297 --> 00:21:18,390
Is that my bra?

464
00:21:20,301 --> 00:21:22,269
What are you doing with my bra?

465
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:24,237
It's not what you think.

466
00:21:24,305 --> 00:21:26,318
We used it to fling

467
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,331
water balloons off the roof.

468
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:30,809
Remember? Those kids couldn't

469
00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:33,209
even get theirs across the street.

470
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:35,239
Yeah, I remember.

471
00:21:37,218 --> 00:21:38,816
Let's bring the rest of these

472
00:21:38,816 --> 00:21:40,414
down to the truck.

473
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:55,802
You want me to give you a hand

474
00:21:55,802 --> 00:21:57,269
with the foosball table?

475
00:21:58,339 --> 00:21:59,755
You keep it.

476
00:21:59,755 --> 00:22:01,171
You need the practice.

477
00:22:03,311 --> 00:22:05,279
Thanks.

478
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,372
So I guess this is it.

479
00:22:09,284 --> 00:22:12,412
Yeah, right. Yeah. I guess so.

480
00:22:14,422 --> 00:22:16,401
Listen, I don't know when

481
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,380
I'm gonna see you again.

482
00:22:18,426 --> 00:22:21,190
Tonight, at the coffeehouse.

483
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:24,231
Right. Yeah. Okay.

484
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:25,815
Take care.

485
00:22:25,815 --> 00:22:27,231
Yeah.
