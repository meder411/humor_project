1
00:00:01,476 --> 00:00:04,445
Okay, here's his diaper bag

2
00:00:04,445 --> 00:00:07,414
and his Mr. Winky.

3
00:00:08,316 --> 00:00:12,385
And him. Hi!

4
00:00:13,288 --> 00:00:14,300
How did everything go?

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,312
Great!

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,904
There was a projectile throwing up

7
00:00:17,904 --> 00:00:20,418
incident, but he started it.

8
00:00:21,496 --> 00:00:23,430
We've gotta go.

9
00:00:24,499 --> 00:00:26,399
Oh, right.

10
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:27,481
I've got some news.

11
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:28,527
It's about us.

12
00:00:29,304 --> 00:00:30,800
You and me?

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,296
No. Susan and me.

14
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,307
The other ''us.''

15
00:00:38,447 --> 00:00:40,506
We're getting married.

16
00:00:45,554 --> 00:00:47,488
As in, ''I now pronounce you

17
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:49,422
wife and wife'' married?

18
00:00:50,325 --> 00:00:51,940
We'd like you to come.

19
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,555
We understand if you don't want to.

20
00:00:54,362 --> 00:00:56,358
Why wouldn't I want to come?

21
00:00:56,358 --> 00:00:58,354
I had fun at the first wedding.

22
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,458
I just thought that--

23
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,317
Why shouldn't I be happy for you?

24
00:01:03,317 --> 00:01:06,970
What would it say about me if I couldn't revel

25
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,466
in your joy?

26
00:01:08,577 --> 00:01:09,976
And I'm reveling, baby!

27
00:01:09,976 --> 00:01:11,375
Believe me!

28
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,374
Is your finger caught in that chair?

29
00:01:16,485 --> 00:01:18,476
Want us to go?

30
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,385
This is cool.

31
00:02:09,385 --> 00:02:10,500
You're actually on television.

32
00:02:11,273 --> 00:02:14,288
I know. It really hit me last night.

33
00:02:14,288 --> 00:02:17,303
I'm gonna be on Days of Our Lives.

34
00:02:17,412 --> 00:02:20,347
Then I started thinking about us,

35
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:23,282
and how these are the days of our lives.

36
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,469
Yes!

37
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:26,419
What?

38
00:02:26,488 --> 00:02:28,388
Carol and Susan's caterer

39
00:02:28,388 --> 00:02:32,486
had a bike accident and she's in a full-body cast.

40
00:02:33,428 --> 00:02:35,396
Yes!

41
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,413
They asked me, which is cool

42
00:02:37,413 --> 00:02:40,447
since I've never catered and I need money.

43
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:41,493
Is this a problem?

44
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,868
Would it matter?

45
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:45,432
You're so great! Thank you!

46
00:02:45,507 --> 00:02:46,957
You're really not going?

47
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:48,407
I'm really not.

48
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:50,422
They already live together.

49
00:02:50,422 --> 00:02:52,401
Why do they need to get married?

50
00:02:52,514 --> 00:02:54,311
They love each other.

51
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:56,412
They wanna celebrate that love

52
00:02:56,412 --> 00:02:58,408
with the people close to them.

53
00:02:58,453 --> 00:03:01,354
If you wanna call that a reason.

54
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:03,423
Who's the bitterest man

55
00:03:03,423 --> 00:03:05,357
In the living room?

56
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,959
The bitterest man

57
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,358
In the living room?

58
00:03:09,497 --> 00:03:11,465
Hi, neighbor.

59
00:03:13,368 --> 00:03:15,364
I thought you were over this.

60
00:03:15,364 --> 00:03:17,360
That has nothing to do with it.

61
00:03:17,472 --> 00:03:19,423
If she were marrying a guy,

62
00:03:19,423 --> 00:03:21,374
you wouldn't expect me to go.

63
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,843
If she were marrying a guy,

64
00:03:23,843 --> 00:03:26,277
she'd be the worst lesbian ever.

65
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:29,475
Did I miss it?

66
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:31,451
No, I'm on right after this guy

67
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:33,385
shoots himself.

68
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:36,280
She's pretty.

69
00:03:36,324 --> 00:03:38,406
And she's nice. She taught me

70
00:03:38,406 --> 00:03:43,496
about how to work with the cameras and smell-the-fart acting.

71
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:46,966
I'm sorry, what?

72
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:48,399
Excuse me?

73
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:51,303
Smell-the-fart acting.

74
00:03:51,506 --> 00:03:53,406
You got so many lines

75
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:56,877
to learn that sometimes you need a minute

76
00:03:56,877 --> 00:03:58,344
to remember your next.

77
00:03:58,413 --> 00:04:01,895
So while you're thinking you take this big pause

78
00:04:01,895 --> 00:04:03,442
where you look all intense.

79
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:05,446
Like this....

80
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:13,340
Here's my scene!

81
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,386
Here's my scene!

82
00:04:16,498 --> 00:04:18,363
Mrs. Wallace?

83
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,850
Dr. Drake Ramoray,

84
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,300
your sister's neurosurgeon.

85
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:23,394
Is she going to be all right?

86
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,439
I'm afraid the situation is

87
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,407
much more dire than we'd expected.

88
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:38,275
Your sister's suffering from a...subcranial hematoma.

89
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:41,500
Perhaps we can discuss this

90
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,479
further over coffee.

91
00:04:49,597 --> 00:04:51,394
Nice!

92
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,496
For a minute, I thought you were

93
00:04:54,496 --> 00:04:56,492
actually smelling something.

94
00:04:58,606 --> 00:04:59,470
-Again!

95
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,334
-All right!

96
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,404
That was so good!

97
00:05:01,404 --> 00:05:02,433
Do it again.

98
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:05,345
Damn it, Braverman!

99
00:05:05,345 --> 00:05:07,245
It's right there on the chart!

100
00:05:08,283 --> 00:05:10,279
I gotta get to work.

101
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:12,275
I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.

102
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,918
No, no, that's me.

103
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:15,482
Oh, right.

104
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:22,262
Oh, thanks. Couldn't....

105
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:25,345
Is everything okay?

106
00:05:25,345 --> 00:05:26,391
No.

107
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:30,951
One of my clients died

108
00:05:30,951 --> 00:05:32,498
on the massage table today.

109
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:34,468
Oh, my God!

110
00:05:35,276 --> 00:05:36,772
That's a little more relaxed

111
00:05:36,772 --> 00:05:38,268
than you want them.

112
00:05:40,482 --> 00:05:41,932
She was, you know,

113
00:05:41,932 --> 00:05:44,998
82 years old and her name was

114
00:05:44,998 --> 00:05:46,511
Mrs. Adelman.

115
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:48,886
Oh, honey.

116
00:05:48,886 --> 00:05:50,484
It's just so strange.

117
00:05:50,525 --> 00:05:51,975
She probably woke up today

118
00:05:51,975 --> 00:05:55,463
and thought I'll have breakfast,

119
00:05:55,463 --> 00:05:57,431
take a walk, then have my massage.

120
00:05:57,499 --> 00:05:59,865
Little did she know God was thinking,

121
00:05:59,865 --> 00:06:02,231
''Okay, but that's it.''

122
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:08,955
Oh, but the weirdest thing was I was cleansing her aura

123
00:06:08,955 --> 00:06:10,468
when it happened.

124
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,259
And when her spirit left her body,

125
00:06:14,259 --> 00:06:17,239
I don't think it went very far.

126
00:06:17,352 --> 00:06:19,400
What do you mean?

127
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,448
I think it went into me.

128
00:06:30,365 --> 00:06:31,929
This is so hard.

129
00:06:31,929 --> 00:06:33,493
I can't decide between Iamb or duck.

130
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,463
Lambs are scarier.

131
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,869
Or the movie would have been called

132
00:06:37,869 --> 00:06:39,467
Silence of the Ducks.

133
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,470
Okay, who ordered what?

134
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,961
I had the half-drunk cappuccino

135
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:47,412
with the lipstick on the rim.

136
00:06:47,482 --> 00:06:49,382
This with the cigarette butt

137
00:06:49,382 --> 00:06:51,282
in it, that's decaf?

138
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,513
Oh, God.

139
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:54,300
You're so uptight

140
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,312
about your mom coming.

141
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:59,806
I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry,

142
00:06:59,806 --> 00:07:01,319
my life is crap.

143
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:02,879
Talk about crap,

144
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,883
listen to Stella Neidman tell her story about Rod Steiger

145
00:07:06,883 --> 00:07:09,334
for the hundredth time.

146
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:15,409
I'm sorry. At least you guys don't

147
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:18,344
have to hear what she says in my head.

148
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:22,815
Pheebs? How long do you think

149
00:07:22,815 --> 00:07:25,249
this lady will be with us?

150
00:07:25,353 --> 00:07:26,900
I don't know. She obviously

151
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,447
has unfinished business.

152
00:07:29,257 --> 00:07:30,383
Sit up!

153
00:07:33,294 --> 00:07:34,386
There she is!

154
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,929
Mom!

155
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:37,362
Hey, sweetie!

156
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:45,371
So this is where you work!

157
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:47,464
Oh, it's wonderful!

158
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:50,324
Is it a living room?

159
00:07:50,324 --> 00:07:52,372
Is it a restaurant? Who can tell?

160
00:07:52,413 --> 00:07:54,313
I guess that's the fun.

161
00:07:54,415 --> 00:07:55,410
Pretty much.

162
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,405
Meet my friends.

163
00:07:56,484 --> 00:07:59,476
Monica! You look gorgeous!

164
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:01,870
Oh, my! The last time I saw you,

165
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,219
it was eat or be eaten.

166
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:07,222
This is Joey, this is Phoebe,

167
00:08:07,222 --> 00:08:09,218
and this is Chandler.

168
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,393
You remember Ross?

169
00:08:10,393 --> 00:08:11,456
Oh, hello, Ross.

170
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:13,359
Mrs. Gree--

171
00:08:15,436 --> 00:08:17,836
What do you think of my daughter,

172
00:08:17,836 --> 00:08:20,236
in the apron with the big job?

173
00:08:20,341 --> 00:08:22,366
Oh, Mom!

174
00:08:23,244 --> 00:08:25,343
If you didn't pour the coffee,

175
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,442
no one would have anything to drink.

176
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:31,446
Believe me, sometimes that happens.

177
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:34,421
This is just so exciting!

178
00:08:34,421 --> 00:08:36,355
You know, I never worked.

179
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,938
I went from my father's house

180
00:08:37,938 --> 00:08:41,825
to a sorority house to my husband's house.

181
00:08:41,825 --> 00:08:43,389
I am just so proud of you!

182
00:08:43,498 --> 00:08:45,398
Really?

183
00:08:45,398 --> 00:08:47,298
Yes. Let's make a day of it.

184
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:49,836
We'll have lunch, shop, get our nails

185
00:08:49,836 --> 00:08:52,270
done. Whatever you want.

186
00:08:52,307 --> 00:08:54,468
I have to work.

187
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:58,275
What, no one else can pour coffee?

188
00:08:58,379 --> 00:08:59,909
I know who it is you remind me of.

189
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:01,439
Evelyn Durmer.

190
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,798
That's before the lousy face-lift.

191
00:09:04,798 --> 00:09:07,346
Now she looks like Soupy Sales.

192
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:13,223
Pheebs, who's Evelyn Durmer?

193
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:15,842
I don't know.

194
00:09:15,842 --> 00:09:17,355
Who's Soupy Sales?

195
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:20,459
Oh, my God!

196
00:09:21,235 --> 00:09:23,231
There's an unattractive

197
00:09:23,231 --> 00:09:25,227
nude man playing the cello.

198
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,906
Just be glad he's not playing

199
00:09:27,906 --> 00:09:30,272
a smaller instrument.

200
00:09:33,247 --> 00:09:35,272
You have some life here, sweetie!

201
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,914
I realize you were upset

202
00:09:36,914 --> 00:09:40,868
when I didn't marry Barry and get a house in the suburbs

203
00:09:40,868 --> 00:09:42,449
with all the security.

204
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:44,554
This is so much better for me.

205
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,289
I know.

206
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:49,285
You didn't love Barry, honey.

207
00:09:49,364 --> 00:09:51,491
And I've never seen you this happy.

208
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,348
I look at you and I think,

209
00:09:54,348 --> 00:09:56,396
''This is what I want.''

210
00:09:57,505 --> 00:09:59,370
For me.

211
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,326
Well, not just for you.

212
00:10:02,326 --> 00:10:04,277
What do you mean?

213
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,376
I'm considering

214
00:10:07,376 --> 00:10:09,372
leaving your father.

215
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,400
All right, tell me

216
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,480
if this is too cute.

217
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:16,506
Lesbian wedding...

218
00:10:16,506 --> 00:10:18,423
chicken breasts.

219
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:23,025
Oh, God.

220
00:10:23,025 --> 00:10:24,521
I think I'm gonna be sick.

221
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,965
What? It's not like I'm putting

222
00:10:26,965 --> 00:10:28,597
little nipples on them.

223
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:33,406
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

224
00:10:33,406 --> 00:10:36,307
Please don't be mad at me.

225
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,538
What can I do?

226
00:10:38,312 --> 00:10:40,360
You want me to make those

227
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,408
marshmallow treats you used to like?

228
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,468
I can call up Carmela

229
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:46,419
and find out how.

230
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,017
I don't understand.

231
00:10:48,017 --> 00:10:49,513
I thought you were happy.

232
00:10:49,557 --> 00:10:52,424
Yeah, well, so did I.

233
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,040
Know how sometimes

234
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,844
you're driving on the highway and you get home and you can't

235
00:10:58,844 --> 00:11:01,358
remember having driven there?

236
00:11:01,402 --> 00:11:04,269
That's what my life's been like.

237
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:05,903
Well, couldn't you listen

238
00:11:05,903 --> 00:11:07,501
to the radio more?

239
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,872
I wish it were that easy.

240
00:11:09,872 --> 00:11:12,946
Then I see you and I think,

241
00:11:12,946 --> 00:11:14,413
''Why can't I have this?''

242
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:16,949
I want adventures, I want

243
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:19,383
to hang out, I want a Chandler.

244
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,387
Mom, believe me, Chandler is

245
00:11:24,387 --> 00:11:27,385
no reason to leave Daddy.

246
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:29,895
You think I'm having fun,

247
00:11:29,895 --> 00:11:32,295
but it's really hard. Really hard.

248
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,948
I've got a lousy job, I barely make

249
00:11:34,948 --> 00:11:37,496
rent, and forget about buying stuff!

250
00:11:37,538 --> 00:11:40,530
Oh, honey, you don't understand.

251
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:43,322
I'd be doing what you're doing,

252
00:11:43,322 --> 00:11:45,335
but with money.

253
00:11:46,347 --> 00:11:49,316
It's very different.

254
00:11:53,354 --> 00:11:54,434
You had no idea?

255
00:11:54,434 --> 00:11:55,514
None.

256
00:11:55,556 --> 00:11:57,421
They didn't fight a lot?

257
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,908
No, they didn't even talk

258
00:11:58,908 --> 00:12:00,358
to each other.

259
00:12:00,394 --> 00:12:02,373
How was I supposed to know

260
00:12:02,373 --> 00:12:04,352
they were having problems?

261
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:06,899
You know, in my day,

262
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,299
divorce was not an option.

263
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,463
Hey, look who's up!

264
00:12:13,474 --> 00:12:14,890
I just can't believe

265
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,306
this is happening!

266
00:12:16,377 --> 00:12:17,844
When I was little,

267
00:12:17,844 --> 00:12:19,311
all parents got divorced.

268
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,893
I figured as an adult,

269
00:12:20,893 --> 00:12:22,406
I wouldn't have to worry.

270
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:24,997
Can't you look at this as flattering?

271
00:12:24,997 --> 00:12:27,511
She wants to be more like you.

272
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,337
Well, then, couldn't she have

273
00:12:30,337 --> 00:12:32,385
just copied my haircut?

274
00:12:32,426 --> 00:12:33,910
When my parents divorced,

275
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,992
I went to a shrink and she told me

276
00:12:36,992 --> 00:12:38,488
that kids blame themselves.

277
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:40,066
But in your case,

278
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:41,533
it's actually kind of true.

279
00:12:42,436 --> 00:12:43,528
Oh, that's him.

280
00:12:44,505 --> 00:12:46,473
Damn! My mail-order

281
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:48,441
grandfather hasn't come yet.

282
00:12:49,343 --> 00:12:49,923
Phoebe?

283
00:12:49,923 --> 00:12:50,503
Hi, Mr. Adelman.

284
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,307
Nice to see you.

285
00:12:52,307 --> 00:12:53,302
Thanks for coming.

286
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:55,911
That's okay. Although you did

287
00:12:55,911 --> 00:12:58,408
cut into my busy day of sitting.

288
00:12:59,353 --> 00:13:00,445
Do you wanna sit?

289
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,888
No, I spent most of midmorning

290
00:13:02,888 --> 00:13:05,288
trying to stand up.

291
00:13:06,294 --> 00:13:08,285
What can I do for you, dear?

292
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:09,858
Okay, I don't know

293
00:13:09,858 --> 00:13:13,378
how to say this but I think when your wife's spirit

294
00:13:13,378 --> 00:13:18,372
left her body it kind of stuck around in me.

295
00:13:19,273 --> 00:13:21,366
You're saying my wife is in you?

296
00:13:22,276 --> 00:13:23,339
Yeah. You don't have

297
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:26,395
to believe me but can you think of

298
00:13:26,395 --> 00:13:28,278
any unfinished business she had?

299
00:13:28,382 --> 00:13:30,373
Any reason to hang around?

300
00:13:30,418 --> 00:13:32,397
I don't know what to say.

301
00:13:32,397 --> 00:13:36,484
All I can think of is that she said that before she died,

302
00:13:36,484 --> 00:13:38,480
she wanted to see everything.

303
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:40,456
Everything?

304
00:13:40,456 --> 00:13:41,485
Everything.

305
00:13:41,596 --> 00:13:43,063
That's a lot of stuff.

306
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:44,530
Oh, wait, I....

307
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,830
I remember she also said she wanted

308
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,327
to sleep with me one last time.

309
00:13:58,346 --> 00:14:00,314
I'm sorry.

310
00:14:00,314 --> 00:14:02,282
There's laughing in my head.

311
00:14:03,484 --> 00:14:06,351
Worth a shot, huh?

312
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:13,453
Look at this!

313
00:14:14,362 --> 00:14:16,313
These are Halloween, three years ago.

314
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,264
My little martini.

315
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:21,359
I love your olive head.

316
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:23,482
Oh, and look, here's Barry.

317
00:14:23,482 --> 00:14:25,495
Did he come straight from work?

318
00:14:26,274 --> 00:14:28,401
Oh, no. That was his costume.

319
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:32,826
See, he's actually an orthodontist,

320
00:14:32,826 --> 00:14:35,374
but he came as a regular dentist.

321
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,963
Yeah, he thought

322
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:38,510
that was really funny.

323
00:14:39,287 --> 00:14:41,300
You guys? Remember when I said

324
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,313
before I don't need your help?

325
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:45,905
Actually, you said, ''Don't touch that

326
00:14:45,905 --> 00:14:48,419
and get the hell out of my kitchen.''

327
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:51,522
Really? Weird. Anyway....

328
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,413
I planned well.

329
00:14:53,413 --> 00:14:54,493
I planned and planned.

330
00:14:55,336 --> 00:14:56,433
I just didn't plan

331
00:14:56,433 --> 00:14:57,530
enough time to do it.

332
00:14:58,406 --> 00:14:59,822
You want some help?

333
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:01,238
If you want.

334
00:15:05,546 --> 00:15:07,394
What a day!

335
00:15:07,394 --> 00:15:09,242
I took her everywhere.

336
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:14,352
The Museum of Modern Art,

337
00:15:14,352 --> 00:15:16,451
Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.

338
00:15:17,258 --> 00:15:18,350
She's still with you?

339
00:15:18,392 --> 00:15:20,826
Yes. I guess she hasn't

340
00:15:20,826 --> 00:15:23,260
seen everything yet.

341
00:15:23,364 --> 00:15:25,315
Be right back. She has to go

342
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:27,266
to the bathroom again.

343
00:15:28,402 --> 00:15:31,462
Such a pretty face!

344
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,939
Oh, this is so much fun!

345
00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:37,503
Just the girls!

346
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,910
You know what we should do?

347
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,508
Does anybody have marijuana?

348
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,510
God!

349
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,413
Did my mother just ask if we have pot?

350
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,002
Look, no one's smoking pot

351
00:15:50,002 --> 00:15:51,515
around all this food.

352
00:15:52,293 --> 00:15:54,284
Well, that's fine.

353
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:56,307
I never did it.

354
00:15:56,307 --> 00:15:58,286
I just thought I might.

355
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,325
So, what's new in sex?

356
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,238
What's new in sex?

357
00:16:05,272 --> 00:16:07,433
I've only been with your father.

358
00:16:07,475 --> 00:16:09,375
I'm dicing. I'm dicing.

359
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,275
I don't hear anything.

360
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,813
This is no offense to your dad, but

361
00:16:13,813 --> 00:16:16,281
I was thinking there might be more.

362
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,914
I'm sorry. I can't have

363
00:16:17,914 --> 00:16:19,478
this conversation with you.

364
00:16:20,254 --> 00:16:20,549
All right.

365
00:16:21,288 --> 00:16:23,284
You come here and drop this bomb

366
00:16:23,284 --> 00:16:25,280
on me before you tell Daddy.

367
00:16:25,393 --> 00:16:27,327
Do you want my blessing?

368
00:16:27,327 --> 00:16:29,261
Want me to talk you out of it?

369
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,331
Then what do you want?

370
00:16:31,331 --> 00:16:33,299
I guess I figured you'd understand.

371
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,430
Why on earth would I

372
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,493
understand this?

373
00:16:37,304 --> 00:16:39,499
You didn't marry your Barry, honey.

374
00:16:40,274 --> 00:16:42,504
But I married mine.

375
00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:50,450
We're in trouble. We only have

376
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,418
1 2 hours and 36 minutes left.

377
00:16:52,486 --> 00:16:54,317
Move, move, move!

378
00:16:54,522 --> 00:16:56,552
Monica, I feel like you should

379
00:16:56,552 --> 00:16:58,582
have German subtitles.

380
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:01,250
Joey, speed it up!

381
00:17:01,362 --> 00:17:03,813
I'm sorry! It's the pigs!

382
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:06,264
They're reluctant to get in the blanket!

383
00:17:06,434 --> 00:17:08,334
How did this happen?

384
00:17:08,334 --> 00:17:10,234
You had this all planned out.

385
00:17:10,438 --> 00:17:13,236
Do you want me to cry?

386
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,336
Is that what you want?

387
00:17:15,336 --> 00:17:17,332
Do you wanna see me cry?

388
00:17:17,445 --> 00:17:19,242
Sir, no, sir!

389
00:17:22,483 --> 00:17:23,472
All right, you!

390
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,849
No. Look, I told you,

391
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:27,447
I am not a part of this thing.

392
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,285
I know you have issues with Carol

393
00:17:30,285 --> 00:17:32,315
and Susan, and I feel for you.

394
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,956
But if you don't help,

395
00:17:33,956 --> 00:17:37,379
I'll take those hot dogs and create an appetizer

396
00:17:37,379 --> 00:17:39,262
called ''Pigs In Ross.''

397
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:41,364
Ball a melon!

398
00:17:41,469 --> 00:17:43,482
How come I'm stuck dicing

399
00:17:43,482 --> 00:17:45,495
when he gets to ball a melon?

400
00:17:49,577 --> 00:17:51,027
How's it going?

401
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:52,477
Great! Right on schedule.

402
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,475
Got my little happy helpers.

403
00:17:56,517 --> 00:17:59,315
That's fine. Whatever.

404
00:17:59,386 --> 00:18:00,398
What's the matter?

405
00:18:00,398 --> 00:18:01,410
Nothing.

406
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,303
Okay, everything.

407
00:18:05,303 --> 00:18:07,316
I think we're calling off the wedding.

408
00:18:08,229 --> 00:18:10,459
You're still gonna pay me, right?

409
00:18:12,266 --> 00:18:14,427
Or something a little less selfish.

410
00:18:15,236 --> 00:18:16,231
What's the matter?

411
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:17,226
What happened?

412
00:18:17,271 --> 00:18:18,818
My parents said they weren't coming.

413
00:18:18,818 --> 00:18:20,365
Oh, my God.

414
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:22,341
I knew they were having

415
00:18:22,341 --> 00:18:26,358
trouble with this but they're my parents.

416
00:18:26,358 --> 00:18:28,371
They're supposed to give me away.

417
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,461
Susan and I fought because

418
00:18:30,461 --> 00:18:32,440
I said maybe we should call it off.

419
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,982
She said, ''This isn't for them.

420
00:18:33,982 --> 00:18:35,478
It's for us.''

421
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,888
And if I couldn't see that,

422
00:18:37,888 --> 00:18:39,486
maybe we should call it off.

423
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:42,354
I don't know what to do.

424
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,948
I can't believe I'm gonna say this,

425
00:18:45,948 --> 00:18:48,399
but I think Susan's right.

426
00:18:48,469 --> 00:18:50,300
You do?

427
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:52,367
Do you love her? And don't be

428
00:18:52,367 --> 00:18:54,363
too emphatic about this.

429
00:18:56,377 --> 00:18:57,469
Of course I do.

430
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,376
Well, then, that's it.

431
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,364
And if George and Adelaide can't

432
00:19:02,364 --> 00:19:05,248
accept that, then the hell with them.

433
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,866
If my parents didn't want me

434
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:11,457
to marry you no way that would have stopped me.

435
00:19:12,226 --> 00:19:14,291
Look, this is your wedding.

436
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,356
Do it.

437
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:21,232
You're right. Of course you're right.

438
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:22,359
So we're back on?

439
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,328
We're back on.

440
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,918
You heard the woman!

441
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:27,465
Peel! Chop! Devil!

442
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,345
Can't believe I lost two minutes!

443
00:19:42,456 --> 00:19:44,287
It just seems so futile.

444
00:19:44,358 --> 00:19:46,371
You know?

445
00:19:46,371 --> 00:19:48,384
All these women, and nothing!

446
00:19:50,464 --> 00:19:52,460
I feel like Superman

447
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,456
without my powers, you know?

448
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,968
I have the cape,

449
00:19:56,968 --> 00:19:59,368
and yet I cannot fly.

450
00:20:00,474 --> 00:20:02,925
Well, now you understand

451
00:20:02,925 --> 00:20:05,376
how I feel every single day. Okay?

452
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:09,415
The world is my lesbian wedding.

453
00:20:19,526 --> 00:20:21,289
Butterscotch?

454
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,477
No one?

455
00:20:24,477 --> 00:20:26,525
All right, you'll be sorry later.

456
00:21:01,402 --> 00:21:02,886
Thank you.

457
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,370
Anytime.

458
00:21:06,507 --> 00:21:07,496
Ross.

459
00:21:12,513 --> 00:21:16,494
Nothing makes God happier than when two people,

460
00:21:16,494 --> 00:21:18,473
any two, come together in love.

461
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,853
Friends, family,

462
00:21:20,853 --> 00:21:23,819
we're gathered here to join Carol and Susan

463
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:25,315
in holy matrimony.

464
00:21:25,392 --> 00:21:26,484
Oh, my God!

465
00:21:26,527 --> 00:21:29,428
Now I've seen everything!

466
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,296
She's gone!

467
00:21:34,401 --> 00:21:36,426
She's gone! She's gone.

468
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,016
Go ahead, get married.

469
00:21:38,016 --> 00:21:39,529
Go, go!

470
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,932
Would you look at them?

471
00:21:50,932 --> 00:21:53,349
Yeah. Can't help but.

472
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,310
How's that pig in a blanket

473
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,261
working out for you?

474
00:22:02,296 --> 00:22:04,560
I wrapped those bad boys.

475
00:22:06,266 --> 00:22:07,278
I miss Rose.

476
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:08,290
Oh, yeah?

477
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,866
I know it's kind of weird,

478
00:22:10,866 --> 00:22:13,363
but she was a big part of my life.

479
00:22:13,407 --> 00:22:15,500
I don't know, I feel alone.

480
00:22:16,276 --> 00:22:18,392
You know, I couldn't help

481
00:22:18,392 --> 00:22:20,508
overhearing what you just said.

482
00:22:21,415 --> 00:22:23,895
I think it's time for you to forget

483
00:22:23,895 --> 00:22:26,375
about Rose, move on with your life.

484
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,854
How about we get you a drink?

485
00:22:28,854 --> 00:22:31,288
Okay. So nice!

486
00:22:38,298 --> 00:22:39,896
I shouldn't even bother

487
00:22:39,896 --> 00:22:41,494
coming up with a line, right?

488
00:22:44,338 --> 00:22:45,532
Hey, Mom, you having fun?

489
00:22:46,306 --> 00:22:48,820
Am I! I just danced

490
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,334
with a wonderfully large woman.

491
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:53,380
And three other girls made eyes

492
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,348
at me over at the buffet.

493
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:56,912
I'm not saying it's something

494
00:22:56,912 --> 00:23:01,249
I wanna pursue but it's nice to have options.

495
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:06,291
There's more alcohol, right?

496
00:23:10,364 --> 00:23:12,355
How you doing?

497
00:23:12,466 --> 00:23:14,297
Okay.

498
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:18,304
You did a good thing today.

499
00:23:22,376 --> 00:23:24,372
You wanna dance?

500
00:23:24,372 --> 00:23:26,368
No, that's fine.

501
00:23:26,413 --> 00:23:28,278
Come on.

502
00:23:28,382 --> 00:23:30,373
I'll let you lead.

503
00:23:48,535 --> 00:23:50,935
Look, penis, schmenis!

504
00:23:50,935 --> 00:23:53,335
Okay? We're all people.

505
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:04,300
Which one of us will be

506
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,251
the first one to get married?

507
00:24:06,353 --> 00:24:08,253
Mon, I was married.

508
00:24:08,355 --> 00:24:09,822
Yeah, me too, technically.

509
00:24:09,822 --> 00:24:11,289
I had a wedding.

510
00:24:11,358 --> 00:24:12,871
Just trying to start

511
00:24:12,871 --> 00:24:14,384
an interesting discussion.

512
00:24:14,461 --> 00:24:16,878
Which one of us do you think

513
00:24:16,878 --> 00:24:19,295
will be the last to get married?

514
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:23,902
Isn't Ben in this?

515
00:24:23,902 --> 00:24:25,301
Of course!

516
00:24:25,405 --> 00:24:27,396
Absolutely.
