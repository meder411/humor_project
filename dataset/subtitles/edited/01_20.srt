1
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:04,333
I can't believe

2
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:05,430
you'd actually say that.

3
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:07,786
I'd much rather be Mr. Peanut

4
00:00:07,786 --> 00:00:09,333
than Mr. Salty.

5
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:10,892
No way.

6
00:00:10,892 --> 00:00:12,342
Mr. Salty is a sailor.

7
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:13,863
He's gotta be

8
00:00:13,863 --> 00:00:15,347
the toughest snack there is.

9
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:18,417
I don't know. You don't

10
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:20,351
wanna mess with Cornnuts.

11
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,352
They're crazy.

12
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:27,258
Oh, my God. You gotta come see this.

13
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:28,840
There's some creep out there

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,387
with a telescope.

15
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:33,362
I can't believe it.

16
00:00:33,362 --> 00:00:34,459
He's looking right at us.

17
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:36,462
Oh, that is so sick.

18
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,464
I feel violated.

19
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,466
And not in a good way.

20
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,374
How can people do that?

21
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:46,943
You guys, look.

22
00:00:46,943 --> 00:00:48,575
Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots.

23
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:40,895
Years from now,

24
00:01:40,895 --> 00:01:43,965
school children will study it as one of the greatest

25
00:01:43,965 --> 00:01:45,461
first dates ever.

26
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,390
Yeah.

27
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,374
I'll say, yeah.

28
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,299
It was unbelievable.

29
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,906
We could be ourselves.

30
00:01:51,906 --> 00:01:53,402
We didn't have to play games.

31
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,476
Have you called her?

32
00:01:55,476 --> 00:01:57,472
She'd know I like her. That's crazy.

33
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,308
Guys. It's gross.

34
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:00,818
It's the next day.

35
00:02:00,818 --> 00:02:02,251
How needy do I wanna seem?

36
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,818
I'm right. Right?

37
00:02:03,818 --> 00:02:05,314
Yeah, let her dangle.

38
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,393
I can't believe my parents are

39
00:02:09,393 --> 00:02:11,526
pushing me to find one of you people.

40
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,358
Come on. Just do it.

41
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,334
Call her.

42
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:18,234
Stop being so testosterone-y.

43
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,435
Which, by the way,

44
00:02:21,435 --> 00:02:23,431
is the real San Francisco treat.

45
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,475
Her machine.

46
00:02:28,475 --> 00:02:29,470
Answering machine?

47
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,864
No, interestingly,

48
00:02:31,864 --> 00:02:33,445
her leaf blower picked up.

49
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,281
So, why didn't you say anything?

50
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:39,887
No. Last time I left

51
00:02:39,887 --> 00:02:43,412
a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase,

52
00:02:43,412 --> 00:02:45,363
''Yes, indeed-io.''

53
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,929
Look, it's Rachel and Barry.

54
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:49,459
Don't everybody look.

55
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,496
What's going on?

56
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,768
They're just talking.

57
00:02:53,768 --> 00:02:55,264
Does he look upset?

58
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,922
Does he look like he was told

59
00:02:56,922 --> 00:02:58,469
to shove anything?

60
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,314
No. Actually, he's smiling.

61
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,406
Oh, my God. Don't do that.

62
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:05,513
What? What? What?

63
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:07,850
That man across the street

64
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,448
just kicked that pigeon.

65
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,375
And basically, that's how

66
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,525
a bill becomes a law.

67
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:21,262
See? Hey, Rach.

68
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,359
How'd it go?

69
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,851
You know, it was actually

70
00:03:25,851 --> 00:03:27,432
really great.

71
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,435
Lunch at the Russian Tea Room.

72
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,858
I had that chicken, where you poke it

73
00:03:31,858 --> 00:03:33,473
and butter squirts out.

74
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,475
Not a good day for birds.

75
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,443
Then we went to Bendel's.

76
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,849
And I told him not to, but he got me

77
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:41,447
a bottle of Chanel.

78
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,367
That's nice. Now was that before

79
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:48,826
or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending

80
00:03:48,826 --> 00:03:51,260
flowers and to leave you alone?

81
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,332
Right. Well, we never actually

82
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:55,300
got to that.

83
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,370
It was just so nice to see him again.

84
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:00,354
It was comfortable

85
00:04:00,354 --> 00:04:02,237
and it was familiar.

86
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,205
It was just nice.

87
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,210
That's nice twice.

88
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,343
Isn't this the same Barry

89
00:04:09,343 --> 00:04:11,339
who you left at the altar?

90
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,311
Where have you been?

91
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:16,316
It was different

92
00:04:16,316 --> 00:04:17,311
with him today.

93
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,258
He wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy.

94
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,794
I mean, we had fun.

95
00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:25,228
Is there anything wrong with that?

96
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,800
Why?

97
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,267
I have my reasons.

98
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:36,859
He's engaged to another woman who happens to be

99
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,343
your ex-best friend?

100
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,860
All right.

101
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,242
I know it's stupid.

102
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:42,860
I'll see him this afternoon

103
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,373
and put an end to it.

104
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,391
I'm not crazy, right?

105
00:04:53,391 --> 00:04:55,291
I mean, it was never like that.

106
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,395
No, it wasn't.

107
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,865
It was so nice

108
00:05:02,865 --> 00:05:04,429
having this little sink here.

109
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:14,236
Then with authority, hang up.

110
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,442
Will you just leave her the message?

111
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,219
Okay. All right, fine.

112
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,819
''Oh, Danielle,

113
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:26,315
I wasn't expecting the machine.

114
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,391
Give me a call

115
00:05:29,391 --> 00:05:30,454
when you get a chance.

116
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,457
Bye-bye.''

117
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,459
Oh, God.

118
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,785
That's what you've been working on

119
00:05:40,785 --> 00:05:42,332
for two hours?

120
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,470
Hey, I've been honing.

121
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,845
What was with the dishes?

122
00:05:47,845 --> 00:05:50,245
She might think I'm in a restaurant.

123
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,346
I might have a life.

124
00:05:52,346 --> 00:05:56,479
Like I haven't been sitting here honing for the last two hours?

125
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,286
The telescope guy's doing it again.

126
00:05:59,286 --> 00:06:01,282
Oh, my God.

127
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:04,827
Go away.

128
00:06:04,827 --> 00:06:06,425
Stop looking in here.

129
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,279
Great.

130
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,325
Now he's waving back.

131
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,398
We gotta do something.

132
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,002
I caught him looking into our place.

133
00:06:15,002 --> 00:06:17,499
I feel like I can't do stuff.

134
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,412
What kind of stuff?

135
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,331
Will you grow up?

136
00:06:24,331 --> 00:06:27,815
I'm not talking about sexy stuff but, like,

137
00:06:27,815 --> 00:06:29,311
when I'm cooking naked.

138
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,219
You cook naked?

139
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,872
Yeah, toast, oatmeal.

140
00:06:33,872 --> 00:06:35,419
Nothing that spatters.

141
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,796
What are you looking at me for?

142
00:06:40,796 --> 00:06:42,360
I didn't know that.

143
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,363
What's the matter?

144
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:47,352
I just--

145
00:06:47,352 --> 00:06:48,432
Oh, Barry, this was not good.

146
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,391
No, it was.

147
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:51,540
It was very, very good.

148
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:53,941
What about Mindy?

149
00:06:53,941 --> 00:06:55,437
Way better than Mindy.

150
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,378
I mean, what about you and Mindy?

151
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,804
If you want, I'll

152
00:07:02,804 --> 00:07:04,288
break it off with her.

153
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,238
No, don't do that.

154
00:07:07,238 --> 00:07:08,284
Not for me.

155
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,311
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush

156
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:12,228
is here for his adjustment.

157
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,232
Thanks, Bernice.

158
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,334
Let's go away this weekend.

159
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,883
This is all way too--

160
00:07:18,883 --> 00:07:20,430
No, we can go to Aruba.

161
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,307
When I went there on what

162
00:07:23,307 --> 00:07:27,279
would've been our honeymoon it was really nice.

163
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,247
You would've liked it.

164
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:31,442
I had a bra.

165
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,418
Hey, Dr. Farber.

166
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,415
All right, Miss Greene,

167
00:07:46,415 --> 00:07:48,366
everything looks fine.

168
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,332
We're starting to see

169
00:07:50,332 --> 00:07:51,429
some real progress.

170
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:56,870
What?

171
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,366
I'm 1 2, I'm not stupid.

172
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,319
Can I use your phone?

173
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:12,321
For future reference,

174
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:16,218
that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.

175
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,333
Yes, it's working.

176
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,287
Why isn't she calling?

177
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:27,238
Maybe she never got your message.

178
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,887
Call her machine,

179
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:32,222
and if she has a lot of beeps that means she didn't get

180
00:08:32,222 --> 00:08:33,234
her messages yet.

181
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,278
Doesn't that make me seem--?

182
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:38,343
Desperate? Needy? Pathetic?

183
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:41,318
You obviously saw my personal ad.

184
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,255
How many beeps?

185
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:46,450
She answered.

186
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,327
This is where you'd use

187
00:08:50,327 --> 00:08:52,227
that ''hello'' word.

188
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:53,914
I won't talk to her.

189
00:08:53,914 --> 00:08:57,447
She got my message and is choosing not to call me.

190
00:08:57,447 --> 00:08:59,460
Now I'm needy and snubbed.

191
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,365
God, I miss just being needy.

192
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,471
So how'd he take it?

193
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,373
Pretty well, actually.

194
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,881
How come you have

195
00:09:13,881 --> 00:09:15,377
dental floss in your hair?

196
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,281
Oh, do I?

197
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,326
We ended up having sex in his chair.

198
00:09:23,326 --> 00:09:25,425
You had sex in his chair?

199
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,354
I said that a little

200
00:09:32,354 --> 00:09:34,305
too loudly, didn't I?

201
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,238
You had what?

202
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,334
Sex in his chair.

203
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:45,206
What...? What were you thinking?

204
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,781
I don't know.

205
00:09:46,781 --> 00:09:48,311
We still care about each other.

206
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:49,850
There's a history there.

207
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,346
It's like you and Carol.

208
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,318
It's nothing like me and Carol.

209
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,425
If she said to you,

210
00:09:58,425 --> 00:10:02,797
''Ross, I want you on this couch right here, right now,''

211
00:10:02,797 --> 00:10:04,361
what would you say?

212
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,430
If it helps, I could slide over.

213
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,341
It's a totally different situation.

214
00:10:12,341 --> 00:10:14,440
It's apples and oranges.

215
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,845
It's orthodontists and lesbians--

216
00:10:16,845 --> 00:10:18,443
I gotta go.

217
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,331
Where are you going?

218
00:10:20,331 --> 00:10:21,377
I just have to go.

219
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:25,253
I have things to do with my life.

220
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,384
I have a jam-packed schedule.

221
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,411
And I am late for keeping up

222
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:31,362
with it, okay?

223
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,403
Mindy.

224
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,474
How are you?

225
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,312
Yes, I heard. Congratulations.

226
00:10:52,312 --> 00:10:54,308
That is so great.

227
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,388
Really, oh, God--

228
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,759
I'm working tomorrow, but if you

229
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,227
want, you can come by if you'd like.

230
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,262
Great.

231
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,459
Great.

232
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,269
So I'll see you tomorrow.

233
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,534
Okay. Bye.

234
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,437
Oh, God. Oh, God.

235
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,541
So how's Mindy?

236
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,318
She wants to see me tomorrow. She

237
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:30,253
sounded weird. I gotta call Barry.

238
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,809
It's me. I just--

239
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:36,259
Mindy.

240
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,330
Mindy. No, I figured

241
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,264
that's where you'd be.

242
00:11:58,317 --> 00:11:59,380
Hell is filled

243
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,443
with people like you.

244
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,320
He's back.

245
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,417
The peeper's back.

246
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:07,475
Get down.

247
00:12:07,475 --> 00:12:08,425
Get down?

248
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:10,319
And boogie.

249
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:13,895
I gotta go and get

250
00:12:13,895 --> 00:12:15,459
my eyes scratched out by Mindy.

251
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,429
She may not even know.

252
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,802
I haven't heard from her in seven

253
00:12:20,802 --> 00:12:23,367
months, what else is it about?

254
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,433
She was my best friend.

255
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,843
We went to camp together,

256
00:12:27,843 --> 00:12:29,441
she taught me how to kiss....

257
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,947
Now, you know,

258
00:12:33,947 --> 00:12:35,443
I'm, like, the other woman.

259
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:36,972
I feel so--

260
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:38,456
Naughty.

261
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,909
See you later.

262
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:43,359
I'll walk with you.

263
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:46,330
When she taught you to kiss, were you

264
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,265
wearing any kind of little uniform--?

265
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,464
That's fine, yeah.

266
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,786
I'm going to the bathroom.

267
00:12:55,786 --> 00:12:57,299
Will you watch my phone?

268
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:58,843
Take it with you.

269
00:12:58,843 --> 00:13:02,280
We haven't had a second date she needs to hear me pee?

270
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,214
Why don't you call her?

271
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,812
I can't. I left a message.

272
00:13:05,812 --> 00:13:07,308
I have some pride.

273
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,414
Do you?

274
00:13:08,414 --> 00:13:09,409
No.

275
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,354
Danielle, hi.

276
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,420
It's Chandler.

277
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,329
I'm fine.

278
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:23,462
Listen....

279
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,834
I don't know if you tried

280
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:30,470
to call me because I accidentally shut off my phone.

281
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,539
That's fine. That's great. Okay.

282
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,317
She's on the other line.

283
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:41,251
She's gonna call me back.

284
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,321
She's on the other line,

285
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:45,289
she's gonna call me back.

286
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,370
Don't you have to pee?

287
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,349
That's why I'm dancing.

288
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:54,311
Mindy.

289
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:55,357
Hey, you.

290
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,468
Hey, you.

291
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,398
So what's up?

292
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,235
We should really be sitting for this.

293
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,311
Sure we should.

294
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,872
I'm gonna ask once,

295
00:14:20,872 --> 00:14:22,419
and I want a straight answer.

296
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,941
Not like when I asked if those red

297
00:14:24,941 --> 00:14:27,421
pants made my ass look big.

298
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,832
I know things have been weird but you're my oldest friend,

299
00:14:31,832 --> 00:14:34,855
except for Laurie who's bitter because

300
00:14:34,855 --> 00:14:37,859
she lost weight and it turns out,

301
00:14:37,859 --> 00:14:39,343
she doesn't have a pretty face.

302
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,874
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

303
00:14:40,874 --> 00:14:42,370
Okay.

304
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,351
Will you be my maid of honor?

305
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,373
Of course.

306
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:52,357
That's so great.

307
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,350
It is. It is. It is.

308
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,445
That's all you wanted to ask?

309
00:14:57,445 --> 00:14:59,396
That's all.

310
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,718
What?

311
00:15:03,718 --> 00:15:05,202
That's not all.

312
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,901
Oh, sure it is.

313
00:15:07,901 --> 00:15:09,397
Oh, no, it isn't.

314
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:12,874
I think Barry's seeing someone

315
00:15:12,874 --> 00:15:14,438
in the city.

316
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,305
What would make you think that?

317
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,883
Since the engagement,

318
00:15:18,883 --> 00:15:20,350
he's acted weird.

319
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,932
And then last night, he came home

320
00:15:22,932 --> 00:15:25,412
smelling like Chanel.

321
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,416
Really?

322
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:33,878
If it'll make you feel any better when Barry and I got engaged,

323
00:15:33,878 --> 00:15:35,425
he was weird too.

324
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,281
Oh, God.

325
00:15:37,281 --> 00:15:38,327
That's what I was afraid of.

326
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,237
What's what you were afraid of?

327
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,892
When Barry was engaged to you,

328
00:15:44,892 --> 00:15:49,358
he and I kind of had

329
00:15:49,358 --> 00:15:51,337
a little thing on the side.

330
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,346
What?

331
00:15:53,346 --> 00:15:54,341
I know, I know.

332
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,950
When he proposed, people said, ''He'll

333
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,447
do to you what he did to Rachel.''

334
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:02,220
And now I feel so stupid.

335
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,195
You are so stupid.

336
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,336
We are both so stupid.

337
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,338
What do you mean?

338
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,205
Smell familiar?

339
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,405
Oh, I'm so sorry.

340
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,361
Oh, no, me.

341
00:16:24,361 --> 00:16:25,407
I am so sorry.

342
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:26,866
No, I am sorry.

343
00:16:26,866 --> 00:16:27,514
I'm sorry.

344
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:43,360
Oh, my.

345
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,335
Four letters, ''circle or hoop.''

346
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,890
Ring, damn it, ring.

347
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,340
Thanks.

348
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,442
You know our phone's not working?

349
00:16:56,442 --> 00:16:58,438
What?

350
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,476
I called and there was no answer.

351
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,381
I turned it off.

352
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,180
Mother of God, I turned it off.

353
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,326
Just like you told her you did.

354
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,390
Just pointing out the irony.

355
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,314
I went across the street

356
00:17:14,314 --> 00:17:16,197
to the doorman.

357
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,247
I got the peeper's name.

358
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:20,226
Can I use the phone?

359
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,207
Can I use your phone?

360
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:29,313
The number for a Sidney Marks, please.

361
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,440
''Heating device.''

362
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,409
Radiator.

363
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,208
Five letters.

364
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,219
''Rdtor.''

365
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,360
Yeah, is Sidney there?

366
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,365
Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman.

367
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,298
So she's a woman, so what?

368
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,463
Yeah, so what?

369
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,267
I live across the street, and I know

370
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:56,263
about your telescope.

371
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,307
And I don't appreciate it.

372
00:17:58,444 --> 00:17:59,843
Yeah, I can see you right now.

373
00:17:59,843 --> 00:18:01,242
Hello?

374
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,893
If I wanna walk around in my

375
00:18:03,893 --> 00:18:06,373
underwear, I shouldn't have to feel--

376
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,316
Thank you.

377
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,306
That's not really the point.

378
00:18:12,306 --> 00:18:14,223
The point is, that--

379
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,806
Mostly free-weights,

380
00:18:15,806 --> 00:18:17,319
but occasionally--

381
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,764
Yeah, my neighbor.

382
00:18:20,764 --> 00:18:22,197
Yeah, the brunette.

383
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,319
She said you looked pretty that day

384
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:27,236
in the green dress.

385
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,500
The green dress? Really?

386
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,772
She said you looked like

387
00:18:31,772 --> 00:18:33,302
Ingrid Bergman.

388
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,442
Did she mention me?

389
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,389
She wants to know why you tie

390
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,357
the towel around your head.

391
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:50,252
It's a leave-in conditioner, okay?

392
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,425
It's a leave-in conditioner.

393
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,237
You got a second?

394
00:18:59,237 --> 00:19:00,204
Sure, sure.

395
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:03,271
Come on in.

396
00:19:03,271 --> 00:19:04,368
Hello, sweetheart.

397
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,278
What you guys doing here?

398
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,213
We are here to break up with you.

399
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,374
Both of you?

400
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,749
We think you're a horrible person,

401
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:18,280
and bad things should happen to you.

402
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:20,419
I'm sorry.

403
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:21,414
God, I am so sorry.

404
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,273
I was weak.

405
00:19:23,273 --> 00:19:24,319
I couldn't help myself.

406
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,459
Whatever I did, I only did

407
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:28,489
because I love you so much.

408
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,849
Which one of us

409
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:33,396
are you talking to there?

410
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:36,396
Mindy.

411
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,272
Of course, Mindy.

412
00:19:38,272 --> 00:19:39,335
It was always Mindy.

413
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:40,843
When we were having sex

414
00:19:40,843 --> 00:19:42,242
in that chair?

415
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,314
I swear, whatever I was doing,

416
00:19:44,314 --> 00:19:46,214
I was thinking of you.

417
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,866
Please. That second time, you couldn't

418
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:51,414
have picked her out of a lineup.

419
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,418
You did it twice?

420
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,841
The first time didn't really count.

421
00:19:55,841 --> 00:19:58,224
You know, it was Barry.

422
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,414
Honey, sweetheart, look.

423
00:20:00,414 --> 00:20:02,365
Just give me another chance.

424
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:03,917
We'll start over.

425
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:05,367
We'll go back to Aruba.

426
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,950
What is it with you and Aruba?

427
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,430
Do you have a deal with the airlines?

428
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:12,467
What do you say?

429
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:14,375
Dr. Farber, we've got

430
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,472
an emergency here.

431
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,361
Jason Castalano's choking

432
00:20:17,361 --> 00:20:18,441
on his retainer.

433
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,348
Oh, God.

434
00:20:20,348 --> 00:20:21,445
I'll be right there, Bernice.

435
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,245
Look, please don't go anywhere.

436
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,290
I'll be right back.

437
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:28,988
Okay, and we'll be here,

438
00:20:28,988 --> 00:20:30,484
hating you.

439
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:32,959
See how he was sweating

440
00:20:32,959 --> 00:20:34,455
when he walked out?

441
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,431
If I'm hogging the ball,

442
00:20:36,431 --> 00:20:39,836
you jump right in there and take some punches.

443
00:20:39,836 --> 00:20:41,269
This feels great.

444
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,988
I'm pretty sure

445
00:20:43,988 --> 00:20:45,569
I'm still gonna marry him.

446
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,369
What are you talking about?

447
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,381
Mindy, the guy is the devil.

448
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,474
He is Satan in a smock.

449
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,387
I know he's not perfect.

450
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,739
But the truth is at the end of

451
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:11,325
the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber D.D.S.

452
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,226
Oh, God.

453
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,752
I hope you can find a way

454
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:17,265
to be happy for me.

455
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,923
And I hope you'll still be

456
00:21:18,923 --> 00:21:20,470
my maid of honor.

457
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,310
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you

458
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,340
and eat you in Aruba.

459
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,550
You okay?

460
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,552
Really?

461
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:40,831
Since I ran out on Barry

462
00:21:40,831 --> 00:21:43,914
at the wedding I've wondered whether I made

463
00:21:43,914 --> 00:21:45,461
the right choice.

464
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:47,363
And now I know.

465
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,304
I'm so glad.

466
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:55,573
Big day.

467
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,870
I'll give you this:

468
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:07,417
Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.

469
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:08,993
He's got the monocle,

470
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:10,460
he's got the top hat....

471
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:12,423
Did you know he's gay?

472
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:18,230
I just wanna clarify this.

473
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,226
Are you outing Mr. Peanut?

474
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,272
Danielle, hi.

475
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,856
Everybody, this is Danielle.

476
00:22:25,856 --> 00:22:27,369
Danielle, everybody.

477
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,371
Why are you here?

478
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,961
I've been calling,

479
00:22:30,961 --> 00:22:32,474
but I had your number wrong.

480
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,815
When I got the right one,

481
00:22:34,815 --> 00:22:36,345
there was no answer.

482
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:38,855
So I thought I'd come down here

483
00:22:38,855 --> 00:22:41,255
and make sure you were okay.

484
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,282
I'm okay.

485
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:45,295
Maybe we could get together later?

486
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,864
That sounds good. I'll call you.

487
00:22:47,864 --> 00:22:50,264
Or you call me, whatever.

488
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,360
You got it.

489
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,437
Bye, everybody.

490
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:53,404
Bye.

491
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:57,792
There you go.

492
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,276
Second date.

493
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,402
I don't know.

494
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,302
You don't know?

495
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,331
She seems nice, but her coming

496
00:23:04,331 --> 00:23:08,769
all the way here just to see if I was okay?

497
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:11,220
I mean, how needy is that?
