1
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:16,472
We're running low on résumés.

2
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:18,380
You want a job

3
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,477
with Popular Mechanics?

4
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:22,265
If you're gonna work for mechanics,

5
00:00:22,265 --> 00:00:24,244
those are the ones.

6
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,842
Guys, I'm going for anything here.

7
00:00:26,842 --> 00:00:29,293
I can't be a waitress anymore.

8
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,876
I'm sick of the lousy tips.

9
00:00:31,876 --> 00:00:34,390
I'm sick of being called ''Excuse Me.''

10
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,966
Paper cut! Paper cut!

11
00:00:36,966 --> 00:00:38,564
Here.

12
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:44,377
Grapefruit juice! Grapefruit juice!

13
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,874
Okay, we're almost done.

14
00:00:46,874 --> 00:00:48,370
Only 20 more to go.

15
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,898
Rach, did you proofread these?

16
00:00:50,898 --> 00:00:53,315
Yeah. Why?

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,971
Nothing. I'm sure they'll be

18
00:00:55,971 --> 00:00:58,422
impressed with your ''compuper'' skills.

19
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,976
Oh, my God!

20
00:01:00,976 --> 00:01:03,427
Do you think it's on all of them?

21
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,831
No, I'm sure the Xerox machine

22
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:10,429
caught a few.

23
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,397
They call this a love seat but I'm not

24
00:02:12,397 --> 00:02:15,332
feeling anything special towards you.

25
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,295
Hey, guys.

26
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:27,245
Hey.

27
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,442
Hi, ladies.

28
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,416
Can I get you anything?

29
00:02:31,416 --> 00:02:33,350
Did you bring the mail?

30
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,434
Lots of responses.

31
00:02:35,434 --> 00:02:37,482
Really? Sure, we have scones left!

32
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:39,358
Read them.

33
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,876
''Dear Miss Greene:

34
00:02:41,876 --> 00:02:44,293
Thank you for your inquiry. However--''

35
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,881
We have apple cinnamon--

36
00:02:47,881 --> 00:02:50,497
''Dear Ms. Greene....'' Yeah, yeah! No.

37
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,872
What?

38
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:56,271
Your Visa bill is huge!

39
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,401
Give me that.

40
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,746
Linda's great.

41
00:03:00,746 --> 00:03:02,213
Why won't you go out with her?

42
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:03,327
I don't know.

43
00:03:03,327 --> 00:03:06,333
Is this about her ''The Flintstones could

44
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,216
have really happened'' thing?

45
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,420
It's not just that. I want someone

46
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:15,250
who does something for me who gets my heart pounding.

47
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,263
Who makes me....

48
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:22,457
Little playthings with yarn?

49
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,329
What?

50
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,340
Could you want her more?

51
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:29,441
Who?

52
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,790
Dee, the sarcastic sister

53
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,337
from What's Happening!!.

54
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,449
Look, I'm totally over her.

55
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:44,420
Hi!

56
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,284
Coffee?

57
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:46,421
No, we're fine.

58
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:47,484
Okay.

59
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:54,862
Shut up!

60
00:03:54,862 --> 00:03:56,358
We're not saying anything.

61
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,852
What?

62
00:03:57,852 --> 00:03:59,302
Joey cried last night.

63
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,887
Thank you.

64
00:04:01,887 --> 00:04:03,434
We were playing poker--

65
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,258
There was chocolate on the three.

66
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:08,306
It looked like an eight.

67
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,282
You should have seen him.

68
00:04:10,282 --> 00:04:12,216
''Read them and weep!''

69
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,220
And then he did.

70
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,234
Now, how come you guys

71
00:04:17,234 --> 00:04:19,213
have never played poker with us?

72
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,289
Yeah, what is that?

73
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:23,319
Like some kind of sexist guy thing?

74
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,393
It's poker, so only guys can play?

75
00:04:25,393 --> 00:04:27,423
No. Women can play.

76
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,947
Then, what is it? Some kind of, like,

77
00:04:29,947 --> 00:04:32,427
some kind of, you know--

78
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,463
All right, what is it?

79
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:37,354
There are just no women

80
00:04:37,354 --> 00:04:38,366
in our game.

81
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,412
We just don't know any

82
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:42,380
women who know how to play poker.

83
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,365
That is a lame excuse.

84
00:04:44,365 --> 00:04:46,282
It's a typical guy response.

85
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,343
Do you know how to play?

86
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,454
No.

87
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,987
But you could teach us.

88
00:04:52,987 --> 00:04:54,483
No.

89
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:04,232
Okay, so now we draw cards.

90
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,872
So I wouldn't need any.

91
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:09,305
I have a straight.

92
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:10,905
Oh, good for you!

93
00:05:10,905 --> 00:05:12,401
Congratulations!

94
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:16,829
Pheebs, how many do you want?

95
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:18,444
I just need two.

96
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,415
The 10 of spades and the 6 of clubs.

97
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,356
No, you can't--

98
00:05:25,356 --> 00:05:27,256
I have the 10 of spades! Here.

99
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,227
Thanks!

100
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,781
No, you can't do that.

101
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:35,232
Don't need them. I'm going for fours.

102
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,462
Oh, you're--

103
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,319
You're going for fours.

104
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,367
Chandler, could you--? Thanks, man.

105
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,438
Here we go.

106
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,396
We've got salmon roulettes

107
00:05:50,396 --> 00:05:52,244
and crudités.

108
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,252
What are you doing?

109
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,305
In poker, there's no food

110
00:05:56,305 --> 00:05:58,256
with more than one syllable.

111
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,326
It's got to be like chips

112
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,294
or dip or pretz--

113
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,893
I hope you'll let it slide just

114
00:06:05,893 --> 00:06:08,390
this once. I was all out of ''pretz.''

115
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,328
Now the dealer--

116
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,355
We got it. Let's play for real.

117
00:06:13,355 --> 00:06:15,306
High stakes. Big bucks!

118
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,905
You sure? Phoebe just threw away two

119
00:06:17,905 --> 00:06:20,402
jacks because they didn't look happy.

120
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,309
But I'm ready. So just deal.

121
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:28,849
Okay, last-minute lesson!

122
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:30,345
Joey....

123
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,254
Three.

124
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,314
Eight.

125
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,740
Eight. Three.

126
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,253
All right, very good.

127
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,235
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

128
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,883
Joey had two fives showing,

129
00:06:44,883 --> 00:06:46,430
so for you to raise was--

130
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,434
Yes?

131
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,271
Downright gutsy.

132
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:54,875
I see, so you were lying.

133
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,371
About what?

134
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,962
About how good your cards were.

135
00:06:57,962 --> 00:06:59,475
I was bluffing.

136
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,184
And what is bluffing?

137
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:08,284
Is it not another word for lying?

138
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:10,858
Sorry to break up this party, but I've

139
00:07:10,858 --> 00:07:13,389
got to go fax résumés before work.

140
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:14,898
We've got to settle.

141
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:16,297
Settle what?

142
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,399
The Jamestown colony of Virginia.

143
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:23,804
See, King George is giving us

144
00:07:23,804 --> 00:07:25,300
the land....

145
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,277
The game, Rachel. You owe us money.

146
00:07:30,277 --> 00:07:32,307
Right.

147
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:34,335
It's their first time.

148
00:07:34,335 --> 00:07:36,252
Let's forget about the money.

149
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:39,222
Hell, no. We'll pay!

150
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:40,872
Monica, I had another

151
00:07:40,872 --> 00:07:42,419
answer all ready.

152
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,327
And you know what?

153
00:07:45,327 --> 00:07:46,424
We want a rematch.

154
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,400
That's fine with me.

155
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,334
Could use some money.

156
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,735
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

157
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:57,232
Well, yeah, I am.

158
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,344
So you get your ya-yas

159
00:07:59,344 --> 00:08:01,312
by taking money from your friends.

160
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:06,276
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from IlKEA.

161
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:10,183
You have to put them together

162
00:08:10,183 --> 00:08:12,179
yourself, but they cost less.

163
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,858
Look, this is poker.

164
00:08:13,858 --> 00:08:15,325
I play to win.

165
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,827
For me to win,

166
00:08:16,827 --> 00:08:18,226
others have to lose.

167
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,265
If you're gonna play,

168
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:22,199
don't expect me to be nice.

169
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:25,204
Because once those cards are dealt....

170
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:35,439
Yeah?

171
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,413
I'm not a nice guy.

172
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,421
All right, let's eat.

173
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:51,463
Did you get that

174
00:08:51,463 --> 00:08:53,431
from the ''I Love Rachel Pizzeria''?

175
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,246
You still on that?

176
00:08:56,246 --> 00:08:58,225
What was with that Black Bart speech?

177
00:08:58,337 --> 00:08:59,821
''When I play poker,

178
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:01,305
I'm not a nice guy.''

179
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,367
You're way off.

180
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,376
No, I don't think so,

181
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:07,310
because I think you love her!

182
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,732
No. I might have had feelings

183
00:09:10,732 --> 00:09:13,183
for her at one time. Not anymore.

184
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,208
I just--

185
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,867
Marcel! Where are you going

186
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:17,414
with that disk?

187
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,317
You are not putting that on again.

188
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,389
If you press that button,

189
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:24,385
you are in very big trouble.

190
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,811
You believe what a jerk

191
00:09:56,811 --> 00:09:58,261
Ross was being?

192
00:09:58,331 --> 00:09:59,895
Yeah, I know.

193
00:09:59,895 --> 00:10:01,459
He can get really competitive.

194
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,463
What?

195
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:07,852
''Hello, kettle? This is Monica.

196
00:10:07,852 --> 00:10:09,365
You're black!''

197
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,376
Please!

198
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,338
I'm not as bad as Ross.

199
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,349
I beg to differ.

200
00:10:18,349 --> 00:10:20,249
The Pictionary incident?

201
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,353
That wasn't an incident.

202
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,855
I was gesturing and the plate

203
00:10:24,855 --> 00:10:27,255
slipped out of my hand.

204
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,810
I got an interview!

205
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,357
You're kidding! Where?

206
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,369
Saks Fifth Avenue.

207
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,303
Oh, Rachel!

208
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,389
It's like the mother ship

209
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:43,306
is calling you home.

210
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,475
What's the job?

211
00:10:48,475 --> 00:10:50,471
Assistant buyer.

212
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,478
I would be shopping!

213
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,318
For a living!

214
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,425
That's Aunt Iris. She's been

215
00:11:00,425 --> 00:11:02,359
playing poker since she was 5.

216
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:03,924
You've got to listen

217
00:11:03,924 --> 00:11:05,420
to every word she says.

218
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,749
Is Tony Randall dead?

219
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:09,233
I don't think so.

220
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,899
He may be now. I hit him with my car.

221
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:12,463
My God, really?

222
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:14,819
No, that's bluffing.

223
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:16,366
Lesson number one.

224
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,809
Let me tell you something. Everything

225
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:23,374
you hear at a poker game is pure crap!

226
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,865
Nice earrings.

227
00:11:24,865 --> 00:11:26,281
Thank you.

228
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,838
Girls, sit down.

229
00:11:30,838 --> 00:11:33,289
Aunt Iris, this is Phoebe and Rachel.

230
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,355
Listen, I'm parked at a meter.

231
00:11:35,355 --> 00:11:37,351
Let's do it. Okay?

232
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,458
We'll start with five-card draw.

233
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:43,497
Then we'll go into the studs and the

234
00:11:43,497 --> 00:11:46,495
hold 'ems. I talked to Cousin Nathan.

235
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,820
Don't touch the cards

236
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,367
when somebody is dealing.

237
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:56,372
How is Nathan?

238
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:58,332
Now he thinks he's a man

239
00:11:58,332 --> 00:12:00,249
in a woman's body.

240
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,815
Don't you mean

241
00:12:01,815 --> 00:12:03,311
a woman in a man's body?

242
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,220
It should be so simple.

243
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,302
Ross, could we please listen

244
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:20,236
to anything else?

245
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,240
All right.

246
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,281
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.

247
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,297
Hi. Guys, guess what?

248
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,835
The fifth dentist caved, and now

249
00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:53,303
they're all recommending Trident?

250
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,243
No, the interview!

251
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:02,880
Unbelievable!

252
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,347
She absolutely loved me.

253
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,429
We talked for over two hours.

254
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:08,408
We've the same taste in clothes.

255
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,321
And I went to camp with her cousin.

256
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,791
The job is perfect! I can do this.

257
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,225
That's great!

258
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,292
Then she told a funny story.

259
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:20,322
Great, tell us and we'll laugh.

260
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,357
Let's play poker!

261
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,284
Listen, we talked about it and

262
00:13:26,284 --> 00:13:28,332
if you don't wanna play, it's okay.

263
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,937
Yes, we can play some other game.

264
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:33,434
Like Pictionary?

265
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,439
Very funny.

266
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:39,245
But we'd like to try poker again.

267
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:41,241
Yes, I think we should.

268
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,952
Do you want me to shuffle those?

269
00:13:43,952 --> 00:13:46,551
That's okay, I'm gonna give it a go.

270
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,985
So Pheebs owes $ 7.50.

271
00:13:56,985 --> 00:13:58,469
Monica owes $10.00.

272
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,432
And Rachel, you owe 1 5 big ones!

273
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:05,325
Thanks for teaching us Cross-Eyed

274
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:08,209
Mary. We gotta play that other way.

275
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,830
All right, here's my $ 7.50.

276
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,445
But this money is cursed.

277
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,316
What?

278
00:14:14,316 --> 00:14:15,413
I cursed it!

279
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,338
Now bad things will happen

280
00:14:18,338 --> 00:14:19,453
to the spender.

281
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:22,238
I'll take it.

282
00:14:22,238 --> 00:14:24,217
Bad things happen to me anyway.

283
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,897
This way, I can split them up

284
00:14:25,897 --> 00:14:27,364
with a movie.

285
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:30,334
So that just leaves the big Greene

286
00:14:30,334 --> 00:14:33,235
poker machine, who owes 1 5.

287
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,240
Could you be any smugger?

288
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,907
Let's see. Rach, I'm opening up

289
00:14:38,907 --> 00:14:43,777
a new art gallery and I could sure use the portraits

290
00:14:43,777 --> 00:14:46,274
of Lincoln and Hamilton.

291
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,466
It's so typical.

292
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:51,479
''I'm a man! I have a penis!

293
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,271
I have to win money

294
00:14:54,271 --> 00:14:56,284
to exert my power over women!''

295
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,389
This isn't over.

296
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,729
We'll play you again.

297
00:15:02,729 --> 00:15:04,225
We'll win. You'll lose.

298
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,203
You'll beg. We'll laugh.

299
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:08,819
We'll take every last dime you have.

300
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:11,333
And you'll hate yourselves forever!

301
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,925
Kind of stepped on

302
00:15:14,925 --> 00:15:16,438
my point there, Mon.

303
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,763
I can't believe you lost!

304
00:15:18,763 --> 00:15:20,310
How much did they take?

305
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,353
Like 30 bucks.

306
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:23,887
I'll give you that money back.

307
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:25,320
Really?

308
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,392
No, I'm bluffing!

309
00:15:27,392 --> 00:15:29,360
You guys haven't learned crap!

310
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,428
Hand me the cards!

311
00:15:33,428 --> 00:15:34,525
Can I?

312
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,529
Yes!

313
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:46,240
Wanna give us your money now? We can

314
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,238
skip the formality of really playing.

315
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:51,361
No, that's fine. We'll see who has

316
00:15:51,361 --> 00:15:53,374
the last laugh, monkey boy.

317
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:57,918
Done with chitchat?

318
00:15:57,918 --> 00:15:59,448
Ready for serious poker?

319
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,459
You guys, look! The one-eyed jack

320
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:03,427
follows me wherever I go.

321
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,198
Right. Serious poker.

322
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,398
Mon, got any more of those salmon--?

323
00:16:09,398 --> 00:16:11,497
You want to eat or play poker?

324
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,767
Where are you going?

325
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:15,297
To the bathroom.

326
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:16,825
Want to go to the bathroom

327
00:16:16,825 --> 00:16:18,309
or play poker?

328
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,244
Go to the bathroom.

329
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,798
Well, I'm gonna order a pizza.

330
00:16:23,798 --> 00:16:25,248
No!

331
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,814
I'm waiting to hear from that job.

332
00:16:27,814 --> 00:16:30,311
The store closes at 9:00. Eat then.

333
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:32,386
That's fine. I'll just have a Tic Tac

334
00:16:32,386 --> 00:16:34,416
to hold me over.

335
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,375
All right. Cincinnati. No blinds.

336
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,423
Everybody, ante.

337
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:40,463
Yes!

338
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,235
Or no.

339
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:48,735
All right! Your money's mine, Greene.

340
00:16:48,735 --> 00:16:51,232
Your fly's open, Geller.

341
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:59,831
You know what I just realized?

342
00:16:59,831 --> 00:17:02,413
Joker is poker with a ''J''!

343
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:06,383
Coincidence?

344
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,424
That's jo-incidence with a ''C''!

345
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,871
Phoebe?

346
00:17:23,871 --> 00:17:25,401
Yeah, I'm out.

347
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,862
I'm in.

348
00:17:27,862 --> 00:17:29,312
Me too.

349
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:30,365
Me too.

350
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:31,315
What do you got?

351
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,350
You better hop out of the shower,

352
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,449
because I got a flush.

353
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,323
Well, well, well!

354
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,878
Hop back in, bucko,

355
00:17:43,878 --> 00:17:46,329
because I got four sixes!

356
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,428
I got four sixes! I won!

357
00:17:48,428 --> 00:17:50,424
I actually won! Oh, my God!

358
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,732
You know what?

359
00:17:52,732 --> 00:17:54,228
I'll make a little Ross pile.

360
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,330
Look!

361
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,858
I think that one was Ross'.

362
00:17:57,858 --> 00:18:00,275
And I think that one was Ross'.

363
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,392
Well, I have got your money

364
00:18:03,392 --> 00:18:05,371
And you'll never see it

365
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,210
And your fly's still open

366
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,288
I made you look

367
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,355
I'm in.

368
00:18:14,355 --> 00:18:15,418
I couldn't be in-er.

369
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,390
Monica, in or out?

370
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,223
I hate this game!

371
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,334
Joey, your bet.

372
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,922
I fold like a hooker

373
00:18:31,922 --> 00:18:35,742
who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy

374
00:18:35,742 --> 00:18:37,238
with sores on his face.

375
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:41,443
I'm out.

376
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:44,885
Ross?

377
00:18:44,885 --> 00:18:46,415
I'm very in.

378
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:48,338
Chandler?

379
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:49,350
Couldn't be more out.

380
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:52,363
Me too. Rachel?

381
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:55,500
I will see you and I'll raise you.

382
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,469
Do you wanna waste another buck?

383
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,887
No, not this time.

384
00:19:00,887 --> 00:19:02,303
What did you have?

385
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,391
I'm not telling.

386
00:19:03,391 --> 00:19:04,375
Show them.

387
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:04,903
No.

388
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:05,397
Show them!

389
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,207
Get your hands out of there!

390
00:19:08,207 --> 00:19:10,203
I've had dates like this.

391
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,813
Boy, you really can't stand

392
00:19:13,813 --> 00:19:15,309
to lose, can you?

393
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,304
Your whole face is getting red.

394
00:19:18,304 --> 00:19:21,188
Veins popping out of your temple!

395
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:22,840
Plus, that shirt doesn't really

396
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,387
match those pants.

397
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,863
I'm not losing.

398
00:19:29,863 --> 00:19:31,393
You're definitely losing.

399
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,195
Hello. Rachel Greene.

400
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,409
Excuse me. It's about the job!

401
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,404
Barbara, hi! How are you?

402
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,410
No, I understand.

403
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,335
Come on. No, I'm fine.

404
00:19:52,335 --> 00:19:54,348
Don't be silly. Yeah.

405
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:56,394
But if anything else

406
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:58,362
opens up, please--

407
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,330
Hello?

408
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,441
Sorry, Rach.

409
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,819
There's gonna be lots

410
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:23,286
of other stuff.

411
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,481
Okay.

412
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,458
Where were we?

413
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,412
Five-card draw. Jacks are better.

414
00:20:31,412 --> 00:20:34,364
Nothing wild. Everybody, ante.

415
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,399
Look, Rach, we don't have to do this.

416
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:39,498
Yes, we do.

417
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,369
All right. Check.

418
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:44,364
Check.

419
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:45,989
I'm in for 50 cents.

420
00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:47,502
Call.

421
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,508
I'm in.

422
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:56,413
I see your 50 cents and I raise you $5.

423
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,482
I thought it was a 50-cent limit.

424
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,356
I just lost a job,

425
00:21:01,356 --> 00:21:02,453
I'd like to raise it $5.

426
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:04,291
Does anyone have

427
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,354
a problem with that?

428
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:07,243
Not at all.

429
00:21:07,243 --> 00:21:08,255
No.

430
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,531
Loser?

431
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,459
No, I fold.

432
00:21:23,459 --> 00:21:25,438
What do you mean, you fold?

433
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,299
I thought that, ''Once the cards

434
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:30,347
are dealt, I'm not a nice guy.''

435
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,288
Were you just full of it?

436
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:47,360
I'm in.

437
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:49,368
How many do you want?

438
00:21:49,368 --> 00:21:50,363
One.

439
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,510
Dealer takes two.

440
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,809
What do you bet?

441
00:21:55,809 --> 00:21:57,305
I bet $2.

442
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:07,357
Okay. I see your $2 and I raise you...20.

443
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:17,325
I see your $20...raise you $25.

444
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,470
I see your $25

445
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,466
and Monica, get my purse.

446
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,284
Rachel, there's nothing in it.

447
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,482
Okay, then get me your purse.

448
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:44,979
Here you go. Good luck!

449
00:22:44,979 --> 00:22:46,463
Thank you.

450
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:53,361
I saw your $25 and I raise you seven.

451
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:55,398
--teen!

452
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,215
Joey, I'm a little shy.

453
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:09,344
That's okay, Ross. You can ask me.

454
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,355
What do you need?

455
00:23:16,355 --> 00:23:17,350
1 5.

456
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:18,424
Here's 10.

457
00:23:18,424 --> 00:23:19,419
I got 5.

458
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:20,459
Thank you.

459
00:23:20,459 --> 00:23:21,454
Good luck.

460
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,435
I am calling your 1 7.

461
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,438
What do you got?

462
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,341
Full house.

463
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,356
You got me.

464
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,334
That's tough to beat.

465
00:24:00,334 --> 00:24:01,397
I thought we had it!

466
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,822
When you don't have the cards,

467
00:24:03,822 --> 00:24:05,437
you don't have the cards.

468
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,337
But look how happy she is.

469
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:19,840
Airmail.

470
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,324
Airplane. Airport. Airport '75!

471
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,419
Airport '77! Airport '79!

472
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,230
Time's up!

473
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:29,460
Bye Bye Birdie!

474
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,427
That's a bird?

475
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,332
That's a bird!

476
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,369
Okay, it's my turn.

477
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:42,338
Go!

478
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:47,247
Bean! Bean!

479
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:51,253
The Unbearable Lightness of Being!

480
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,553
That you get?

481
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:58,353
That you get?!
