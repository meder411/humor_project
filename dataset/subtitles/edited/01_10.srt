1
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,814
Guys, there's somebody

2
00:00:25,814 --> 00:00:27,378
I'd like you to meet.

3
00:00:30,256 --> 00:00:31,484
Wait, wait. What is that?

4
00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:33,754
That's Marcel. Wanna say hi?

5
00:00:33,754 --> 00:00:35,250
No, I don't.

6
00:00:35,294 --> 00:00:37,376
He's cute! Where'd you get him?

7
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,458
My friend Bethel saved him from a lab.

8
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:41,358
That is so cruel.

9
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:42,931
Why would a parent

10
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:44,461
name their child Bethel?

11
00:00:48,274 --> 00:00:50,469
That monkey's got a Ross on his ass.

12
00:00:55,314 --> 00:00:56,798
Is he gonna live with you

13
00:00:56,798 --> 00:00:58,282
in your apartment?

14
00:00:58,384 --> 00:00:59,851
Yeah. It's been kind of quiet

15
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,318
since Carol left.

16
00:01:01,421 --> 00:01:03,355
Why not get a roommate?

17
00:01:03,423 --> 00:01:05,937
You reach a certain age, having

18
00:01:05,937 --> 00:01:08,451
a roommate is just kind of pathet--

19
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:13,444
That's ''pathet.'' Sanskrit for

20
00:01:13,444 --> 00:01:15,457
''really cool way to live.''

21
00:02:05,318 --> 00:02:07,411
I'm doing new material tonight.

22
00:02:07,453 --> 00:02:09,904
I have 1 2 songs about my mother's

23
00:02:09,904 --> 00:02:12,355
suicide and one about a snowman.

24
00:02:14,393 --> 00:02:17,328
You might wanna open with the snowman.

25
00:02:18,364 --> 00:02:19,393
Hi, Joey.

26
00:02:19,393 --> 00:02:20,422
Hey, buddy.

27
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:23,230
So how'd it go?

28
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,226
I didn't get the job.

29
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:27,756
How could you not?

30
00:02:27,756 --> 00:02:29,240
You were Santa last year.

31
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:32,255
Some fat guy's sleeping

32
00:02:32,255 --> 00:02:34,234
with the store manager.

33
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:36,865
He's not even jolly.

34
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,349
It's all political.

35
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:39,914
What are you gonna be?

36
00:02:39,914 --> 00:02:41,444
One of his helpers.

37
00:02:42,255 --> 00:02:43,751
It's just such a slap in the face,

38
00:02:43,751 --> 00:02:45,247
you know?

39
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,838
Do you know what you're doing

40
00:02:46,838 --> 00:02:48,385
for New Year's?

41
00:02:49,495 --> 00:02:50,945
Hey, what?

42
00:02:50,945 --> 00:02:52,395
What is wrong with New Year's?

43
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:54,865
You have Paolo. You don't have

44
00:02:54,865 --> 00:02:59,304
to face the pressure of finding lips to kiss

46
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,238
when the ball drops!

47
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,240
Man, I'm talking loud!

48
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,327
Paolo's gonna be in Rome

49
00:03:06,327 --> 00:03:08,244
this New Year's.

50
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:10,310
I'll be just as pathetic as you.

51
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,306
Yeah, you wish.

52
00:03:14,253 --> 00:03:16,312
I've got an idea. Dinner.

53
00:03:16,422 --> 00:03:18,373
It's perfect. We'll put it between

54
00:03:18,373 --> 00:03:20,324
lunch and breakfast.

55
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:23,859
I'm sick of being a victim

56
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:25,457
of this Dick Clark holiday.

57
00:03:26,265 --> 00:03:28,295
I say this year, we make a pact.

58
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:30,325
Just the six of us. Dinner.

59
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:30,915
Sure.

60
00:03:30,915 --> 00:03:31,461
Fine.

61
00:03:32,271 --> 00:03:34,364
I was hoping for more enthusiasm.

62
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:38,389
Phoebe, you're on.

63
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:39,435
Oh, good.

64
00:03:40,246 --> 00:03:41,844
Hi. Ladies and gentlemen,

65
00:03:41,844 --> 00:03:46,275
back by popular demand Miss Phoebe Buffay.

67
00:03:49,455 --> 00:03:51,480
Hi. Thanks. Hi.

68
00:03:52,491 --> 00:03:54,442
I wanna start with a song

69
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,393
that means a lot to me.

70
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:05,193
I made a man with eyes of coal

71
00:04:05,304 --> 00:04:08,330
And a smile so bewitching

72
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:11,401
How was I supposed to know

73
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,441
That my mom was dead in the kitchen?

74
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,314
My mother's ashes

75
00:04:24,457 --> 00:04:27,426
Even her eyelashes

76
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:34,222
Are resting in a little yellow jar

77
00:04:36,435 --> 00:04:39,370
And sometimes when it's freezing

78
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:42,366
I feel a little sneezy

79
00:04:43,276 --> 00:04:45,358
And now I-- Excuse me?

80
00:04:45,358 --> 00:04:47,440
Excuse me? Yeah, noisy boys.

81
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:51,333
Is it something you'd like

82
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,284
to share with the group?

83
00:04:54,353 --> 00:04:56,480
No. No, that's okay.

84
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:58,723
If it's important enough

85
00:04:58,723 --> 00:05:01,756
while I'm playing it's important enough

87
00:05:01,756 --> 00:05:03,286
for everyone else.

88
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:06,229
That guy's going home with a note.

89
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:12,819
I was just saying--

90
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:14,201
Speak up.

91
00:05:14,307 --> 00:05:15,296
Sorry, I--

92
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:18,357
I was saying you were the most

93
00:05:18,357 --> 00:05:20,405
beautiful woman I'd ever seen.

94
00:05:21,213 --> 00:05:24,863
And he said that Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman

96
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:26,410
he'd ever seen.

97
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,367
I said I liked her in Splash,

98
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:30,215
but not Wall Street.

99
00:05:30,323 --> 00:05:33,315
I thought she had a hard quality.

100
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:35,874
While Daryl is beautiful

101
00:05:35,874 --> 00:05:39,397
in a conventional way you are luminous

103
00:05:39,397 --> 00:05:41,331
with a kind of delicate grace.

104
00:05:44,236 --> 00:05:47,228
Then that's when you started yelling.

105
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,244
We're gonna take a short break.

106
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:02,783
That guy's going home

107
00:06:02,783 --> 00:06:04,279
with more than a note.

108
00:06:09,295 --> 00:06:11,195
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.

109
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:16,730
I can't believe he hasn't

110
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,226
kissed you yet.

111
00:06:18,304 --> 00:06:20,755
By my sixth date with Paolo,

112
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,206
he'd already named both my breasts.

113
00:06:26,312 --> 00:06:28,405
Did I just share too much?

114
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:31,443
Just a smidge.

115
00:06:32,418 --> 00:06:34,335
David's, like, a scientist guy.

116
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:36,252
He's very methodical.

117
00:06:36,322 --> 00:06:37,334
I think it's romantic.

118
00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:38,346
Me too!

119
00:06:38,424 --> 00:06:40,341
Did you ever see

120
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:42,258
An Officer and a Gentleman?

121
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,295
He's kind of like the guy

122
00:06:44,295 --> 00:06:46,229
I went to see that with.

123
00:06:51,237 --> 00:06:53,250
Except he's smarter and gentler

124
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,263
and sweeter.

125
00:06:55,474 --> 00:06:58,375
I just wanna be with him all the time.

126
00:06:58,477 --> 00:07:00,342
You know, day and night.

127
00:07:00,342 --> 00:07:02,207
And night and day.

128
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:05,182
And special occasions.

129
00:07:07,286 --> 00:07:08,782
I see. You're gonna ask him

130
00:07:08,782 --> 00:07:10,278
to New Year's.

131
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:12,385
She's gonna break the pact.

132
00:07:12,385 --> 00:07:14,381
No! No, no.

133
00:07:14,427 --> 00:07:17,191
No. Yeah, could I just--?

134
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:20,916
Yeah. I already asked Janice.

135
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,400
What?

136
00:07:22,435 --> 00:07:25,336
This was a pact! This was your pact!

137
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:26,854
I couldn't handle the pressure.

138
00:07:26,854 --> 00:07:28,304
I snapped!

139
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:29,874
But that was the worst breakup

140
00:07:29,874 --> 00:07:31,341
in history!

141
00:07:31,444 --> 00:07:33,344
I'm not saying it was a good idea.

142
00:07:33,344 --> 00:07:35,244
I snapped!

143
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:39,317
Hi, sorry I'm late.

144
00:07:47,526 --> 00:07:49,426
Too many jokes.

145
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,354
Must mock Joey.

146
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,235
Nice shoes, huh?

147
00:07:58,237 --> 00:07:59,465
God, you're killing me!

148
00:08:01,407 --> 00:08:03,290
Ross, he's playing

149
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,173
with my spatulas again!

150
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,728
He's not gonna hurt them, right?

151
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:10,179
Do you always have to bring him?

152
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:13,751
I didn't wanna leave him alone.

153
00:08:13,751 --> 00:08:16,219
We had our first fight this morning.

154
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:20,307
It has to do with my working late.

155
00:08:20,307 --> 00:08:23,191
I said some things that I didn't mean.

156
00:08:24,497 --> 00:08:27,295
He threw some feces.

157
00:08:30,336 --> 00:08:31,832
If you're working late,

158
00:08:31,832 --> 00:08:33,328
I can look in on him.

159
00:08:33,439 --> 00:08:35,304
That would be great!

160
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:37,392
But make sure it seems

161
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,343
like you're there to see him.

162
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:41,402
You're not doing it for me.

163
00:08:42,214 --> 00:08:43,710
Okay. But if he asks,

164
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,206
I'm not going to lie.

165
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:52,839
But you can't actually

166
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,255
test this theory.

167
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:56,322
Today's particle accelerators

168
00:08:56,322 --> 00:09:00,813
aren't powerful enough to simulate these conditions.

170
00:09:00,813 --> 00:09:03,162
I have a question then.

171
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:04,299
Yeah?

172
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:05,396
Do you plan on kissing me ever?

173
00:09:09,475 --> 00:09:11,875
That's definitely a valid question,

174
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:18,282
and the answer would be yes. Yes, I was.

176
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:24,304
But I wanted it to be

177
00:09:24,304 --> 00:09:27,805
this phenomenal kiss at a phenomenal moment

179
00:09:27,805 --> 00:09:29,318
because it's you.

180
00:09:29,395 --> 00:09:30,384
Sure.

181
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,192
The longer I waited, the more

182
00:09:33,192 --> 00:09:35,188
phenomenal the kiss had to be.

183
00:09:35,234 --> 00:09:37,230
Now, it's just gotta be

184
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,330
one of those things where I sweep everything off the table.

186
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:43,891
And I'm not really

187
00:09:43,891 --> 00:09:45,341
a sweeping sort of fella.

188
00:09:45,444 --> 00:09:47,440
David, I think you are

189
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,436
a sweeping sort of fella.

190
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,263
I mean, you're a sweeper

191
00:09:52,263 --> 00:09:54,311
trapped inside a physicist's body.

192
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:55,884
Really?

193
00:09:55,884 --> 00:09:56,447
I'm sure.

194
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:00,214
You should just do it. Just throw me.

195
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:04,375
Now?

196
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,421
Yeah, right now. Just....

197
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:07,465
Okay. Okay. Okay.

198
00:10:10,436 --> 00:10:11,886
You know what?

199
00:10:11,886 --> 00:10:13,336
This is really expensive.

200
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,374
And this was a gift.

201
00:10:17,443 --> 00:10:18,939
Now you're just tidying up.

202
00:10:18,939 --> 00:10:20,435
Okay.

203
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,746
You want me to throw you--?

204
00:10:26,746 --> 00:10:28,242
I can hop.

205
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,383
Tell me something, what does

206
00:10:46,383 --> 00:10:48,396
''no-date pact'' mean to you?

207
00:10:48,474 --> 00:10:50,425
It's just that Chandler

208
00:10:50,425 --> 00:10:52,376
and Phoebe have somebody.

209
00:10:52,478 --> 00:10:54,469
I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.

210
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:55,542
Your ex-boyfriend?

211
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:56,571
Yeah.

212
00:10:57,383 --> 00:10:59,413
You know more than one Fun Bobby?

213
00:10:59,413 --> 00:11:01,443
I happen to know a Fun Bob.

214
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,889
Okay. Here we go.

215
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:08,323
There's no room for milk.

216
00:11:13,432 --> 00:11:15,457
There. Now there is.

217
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:18,300
So on our no-date evening,

218
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,365
three of you now have dates.

219
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,286
Four.

220
00:11:22,286 --> 00:11:23,332
Five.

221
00:11:24,276 --> 00:11:25,356
Sorry. Paolo's catching

222
00:11:25,356 --> 00:11:26,436
an earlier flight.

223
00:11:27,246 --> 00:11:28,793
And I met this really hot

224
00:11:28,793 --> 00:11:30,340
single mom at the store.

225
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,444
What's an elf to do?

226
00:11:33,352 --> 00:11:35,400
So I'll be the only one alone

227
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,448
when the ball drops?

228
00:11:38,257 --> 00:11:40,270
We'll have a big party,

229
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,283
and no one will know who's with who.

230
00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:44,357
I'll know. This is so not

231
00:11:44,357 --> 00:11:46,353
what I needed right now.

232
00:11:46,465 --> 00:11:47,864
What's the matter?

233
00:11:47,864 --> 00:11:49,263
Oh, it's Marcel.

234
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,938
He's angry with me. I have

235
00:11:53,938 --> 00:11:56,406
no idea why. He keeps shutting me out.

236
00:11:56,475 --> 00:11:58,392
He's walking around all the time,

237
00:11:58,392 --> 00:12:00,309
dragging his hands.

238
00:12:01,213 --> 00:12:02,709
That's weird.

239
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:04,205
I had a blast with him.

240
00:12:04,316 --> 00:12:05,311
Really?

241
00:12:05,311 --> 00:12:06,306
We played, watched TV.

242
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,218
That juggling thing is amazing.

243
00:12:12,224 --> 00:12:14,215
What juggling thing?

244
00:12:14,426 --> 00:12:15,922
With the socks?

245
00:12:15,922 --> 00:12:17,418
I figured you taught him that.

246
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,421
No.

247
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:22,849
It wasn't that big a deal.

248
00:12:22,849 --> 00:12:25,232
Just socks. And a melon.

249
00:12:29,274 --> 00:12:30,354
Phoebe!

250
00:12:30,354 --> 00:12:31,434
Max. Do you know everybody?

251
00:12:31,477 --> 00:12:34,344
No. Have you seen David?

252
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:36,373
He hasn't been around.

253
00:12:36,482 --> 00:12:38,461
If you see him, tell him to pack.

254
00:12:38,461 --> 00:12:40,440
We are going to Minsk.

255
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:42,316
Minsk?

256
00:12:42,316 --> 00:12:43,379
Minsk. It's in Russia.

257
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,380
I know where Minsk is.

258
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,875
We got the grant.

259
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,490
Three years, all expenses paid.

260
00:12:52,297 --> 00:12:53,844
And if you're gonna do Minsk,

261
00:12:53,844 --> 00:12:55,391
that's the way to go.

262
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,481
So when do you leave?

263
00:12:57,481 --> 00:12:58,561
January 1st.

264
00:13:06,445 --> 00:13:08,925
Hello?

265
00:13:08,925 --> 00:13:11,405
What? Hey. Hi.

266
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:13,781
What are you doing here?

267
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:15,345
Max told me about Minsk.

268
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,355
Congratulations! This is so exciting!

269
00:13:19,525 --> 00:13:20,992
It'd be even more exciting

270
00:13:20,992 --> 00:13:22,459
if we were going.

271
00:13:23,228 --> 00:13:25,423
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?

272
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:30,815
Tell her. ''I don't wanna go to work with Lipson,

274
00:13:30,815 --> 00:13:32,362
Yamaguchi and Flank.

275
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:33,984
I wanna stay and make out

276
00:13:33,984 --> 00:13:35,531
with my girlfriend!''

277
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:38,436
Okay, thank you, Max. Thank you.

278
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,247
So you're really not going?

279
00:13:42,347 --> 00:13:43,843
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

280
00:13:43,843 --> 00:13:45,339
I just....

281
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,900
How can I leave you?

282
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,350
I just found you.

283
00:13:48,387 --> 00:13:52,255
Oh, David. But what are you gonna do?

284
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:56,452
I don't know. You decide.

285
00:13:57,262 --> 00:13:58,377
Don't do that.

286
00:13:58,377 --> 00:13:59,492
But I'm asking you.

287
00:14:00,232 --> 00:14:01,813
I can't make a decision. Just--

288
00:14:01,813 --> 00:14:03,394
Okay. Stay.

289
00:14:06,205 --> 00:14:06,751
Stay.

290
00:14:06,751 --> 00:14:07,297
Stay.

291
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:17,407
Getting so good at that!

292
00:14:19,218 --> 00:14:21,243
It was Max's stuff.

293
00:14:29,228 --> 00:14:31,458
I love this artichoke thing.

294
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:33,795
Don't tell me what's in it.

295
00:14:33,795 --> 00:14:35,359
The diet starts tomorrow.

296
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:42,332
You remember Janice.

297
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:45,242
Vividly.

298
00:14:45,444 --> 00:14:47,395
How are you?

299
00:14:47,395 --> 00:14:49,346
I am fantastic.

300
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:50,370
Now.

301
00:14:52,284 --> 00:14:53,882
It's amazing. We've been back

302
00:14:53,882 --> 00:14:57,420
together for what like 10 minutes, and--

304
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,552
Is that all?

305
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:02,283
It's like we were never apart.

306
00:15:02,394 --> 00:15:04,294
Of course, we were, but--

307
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:06,194
Forgive and forget.

308
00:15:06,298 --> 00:15:08,391
Well, forget.

309
00:15:19,344 --> 00:15:19,890
Hi.

310
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,436
Hi, I'm Sandy.

311
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:23,306
Sandy, hi. Come on in.

312
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:35,338
You brought your kids.

313
00:15:35,338 --> 00:15:37,351
Yeah. That's okay, right?

314
00:15:39,431 --> 00:15:41,831
Party!

315
00:15:41,831 --> 00:15:44,231
That thing is not coming in here!

316
00:15:44,336 --> 00:15:46,429
This is how you greet guests?

317
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:49,304
If I showed up with my new girlfriend,

318
00:15:49,304 --> 00:15:51,369
she wouldn't be welcome?

319
00:15:52,277 --> 00:15:54,273
Your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate

320
00:15:54,273 --> 00:15:56,269
on my coffee table.

321
00:15:56,348 --> 00:15:57,895
He was more embarrassed

322
00:15:57,895 --> 00:15:59,442
about that than anyone.

323
00:16:01,386 --> 00:16:03,399
And for him to have the courage

324
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:07,384
to walk back in here like nothing happened--

326
00:16:08,393 --> 00:16:09,906
All right. All right.

327
00:16:09,906 --> 00:16:11,419
Just keep him away from me.

328
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,289
Thank you. Come on, Marcel.

329
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:17,297
What do you say you and I mingle?

330
00:16:18,337 --> 00:16:20,385
All right, I'll catch up

331
00:16:20,385 --> 00:16:22,433
with you later.

332
00:16:28,246 --> 00:16:30,726
Oh, my gosh!

333
00:16:30,726 --> 00:16:33,206
Rachel, honey, are you okay?

334
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:35,786
Where's Paolo?

335
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,254
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.

336
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:40,448
And then your face exploded?

337
00:16:42,327 --> 00:16:43,351
No.

338
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:46,280
Okay. I was at the airport

339
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,801
getting into a cab when this woman, this blond

341
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:55,386
planet with a pocketbook starts yelling. Something

343
00:16:55,386 --> 00:16:57,434
about how it was her cab first.

344
00:16:57,476 --> 00:16:59,444
The next thing, she just

345
00:16:59,444 --> 00:17:01,412
starts pulling me out by my hair!

346
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:03,698
And I was blowing my attack

347
00:17:03,698 --> 00:17:07,377
whistle thingy and three more cabs show up.

349
00:17:08,186 --> 00:17:10,285
So as I'm going to get into a cab,

350
00:17:10,285 --> 00:17:12,384
she tackles me!

351
00:17:13,191 --> 00:17:15,705
And I hit my head on the curb

352
00:17:15,705 --> 00:17:18,219
and cut my lip on my whistle.

353
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,293
Everybody having fun at the party?

354
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:27,771
Are people eating my dip?

355
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:29,204
Yes.

356
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,405
There.

357
00:17:36,314 --> 00:17:38,327
That looks okay, right?

358
00:17:38,327 --> 00:17:40,340
You went a bit wide on the lipstick.

359
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:41,835
Oh, I did?

360
00:17:41,835 --> 00:17:43,251
Yeah.

361
00:17:43,321 --> 00:17:45,272
It's hard for me to tell.

362
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,223
My eye's closing up.

363
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:49,260
Let me get it for you.

364
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:50,891
Ow!

365
00:17:50,891 --> 00:17:51,420
Okay.

366
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,255
You know what? It looks fine.

367
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:57,264
Okay, here we go.

368
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:59,337
Screw Paolo,

369
00:17:59,337 --> 00:18:01,305
screw the psycho cab lady.

370
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:02,890
It's New Year's Eve.

371
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,374
Let's have a good time.

372
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:05,359
Okay, here we go.

373
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:06,309
Okay.

374
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:09,370
All right, there you go. This way.

375
00:18:10,482 --> 00:18:12,313
Here you go.

376
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,853
When I saw you at the store

377
00:18:16,853 --> 00:18:21,256
last week it was the first time

379
00:18:21,256 --> 00:18:23,321
I ever mentally undressed an elf.

380
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,409
Wow, that's dirty.

381
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:29,388
Yeah.

382
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:34,498
Hey, kids.

383
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,325
He doesn't have to spend

384
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:42,246
the whole evening with me but at least check in.

386
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:45,349
There you are!

387
00:18:47,219 --> 00:18:49,414
You got away from me.

388
00:18:50,222 --> 00:18:52,218
But you found me.

389
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:54,214
Here, Ross, take our picture.

390
00:18:54,326 --> 00:18:57,420
Smile. You're on Janice Camera.

391
00:18:58,363 --> 00:19:00,194
IKill me. IKill me now.

392
00:19:05,203 --> 00:19:07,467
Hi, I'm Rachel.

393
00:19:08,206 --> 00:19:10,299
So whose friend are you?

394
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:17,307
Look at me, spilling everywhere.

395
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:21,218
Everybody, it's Fun Bobby!

396
00:19:24,322 --> 00:19:25,869
Hey, sorry I'm late.

397
00:19:25,869 --> 00:19:29,488
But my grandfather died about two hours ago.

399
00:19:30,228 --> 00:19:32,827
But I couldn't get a flight

400
00:19:32,827 --> 00:19:35,426
out till tomorrow, so here I am.

401
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,866
Hey, Fun Bobby! How's it going, man?

402
00:19:38,866 --> 00:19:41,431
Whoa! Who died?

403
00:19:46,211 --> 00:19:47,360
It's gonna be an open casket,

404
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,509
you know?

405
00:19:50,215 --> 00:19:52,513
So at least I'll get to see him again.

406
00:19:57,222 --> 00:20:00,316
Bobby? Fun Bobby?

407
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,419
Let me talk to you for just a sec.

408
00:20:04,262 --> 00:20:05,342
I recently lost

409
00:20:05,342 --> 00:20:07,998
a grandparent myself so I really know exactly

411
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,465
how you feel.

412
00:20:10,268 --> 00:20:11,752
But you're really bringing

413
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,236
the party down.

414
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:15,385
I'm sorry.

415
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:16,431
Yeah, yeah, okay.

416
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:19,533
There you go. There you go.

417
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:23,759
I'm gonna blow this one up

418
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:26,239
and write ''Reunited'' in glitter.

419
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,285
All right, Janice, that's it!

420
00:20:28,386 --> 00:20:31,253
Janice. Janice.

421
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:33,807
Hey, Janice, when I invited you,

422
00:20:33,807 --> 00:20:36,258
I didn't think it meant--

423
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,386
Oh, no!

424
00:20:42,467 --> 00:20:45,265
I'm sorry you misunderstood.

425
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,382
You listen to me!

426
00:20:46,382 --> 00:20:47,394
You listen to me!

427
00:20:47,505 --> 00:20:49,956
One of these times, it's just gonna be

428
00:20:49,956 --> 00:20:52,407
your last chance with me!

429
00:20:54,412 --> 00:20:56,380
Will you give me the thing?

430
00:21:00,252 --> 00:21:01,298
Hi, Max.

431
00:21:01,298 --> 00:21:02,344
Yoko.

432
00:21:07,425 --> 00:21:08,938
I've decided to go to Minsk

433
00:21:08,938 --> 00:21:10,451
without you.

434
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,327
Wow.

435
00:21:13,327 --> 00:21:17,350
It won't be the same...but it will still be Minsk.

437
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,267
Happy New Year.

438
00:21:20,472 --> 00:21:22,423
Are you all right?

439
00:21:22,423 --> 00:21:24,374
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

440
00:21:29,547 --> 00:21:31,344
Come on.

441
00:21:33,385 --> 00:21:35,415
You're going to Minsk.

442
00:21:35,415 --> 00:21:37,445
No, I'm not going to Minsk.

443
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:39,450
You are so going to Minsk.

444
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:41,470
You belong in Minsk.

445
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,449
You can't stay here just for me.

446
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:46,457
If I go, I have to break up with you.

447
00:21:46,564 --> 00:21:48,031
And I can't break up with you.

448
00:21:48,031 --> 00:21:49,498
Yes, you can.

449
00:21:50,302 --> 00:21:52,350
Just say, ''Phoebe, I love you,

450
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,398
but my work is my life.

451
00:21:54,472 --> 00:21:56,372
That's what I have to do.''

452
00:21:56,474 --> 00:21:58,391
And I say, ''Your work?

453
00:21:58,391 --> 00:22:00,308
How can you say that?''

454
00:22:01,413 --> 00:22:03,927
Then you say, ''I have no choice.

455
00:22:03,927 --> 00:22:06,441
Can't you understand that?''

456
00:22:07,218 --> 00:22:09,214
And I say, ''No! No!

457
00:22:09,214 --> 00:22:11,210
I can't understand that!''

458
00:22:11,323 --> 00:22:11,886
Ow.

459
00:22:11,886 --> 00:22:12,449
Sorry.

460
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:15,843
And then you put

461
00:22:15,843 --> 00:22:17,327
your arms around me.

462
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:19,329
Then you put your arms around me.

463
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:21,229
Oh, sorry.

464
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,900
And then you tell me you love me

465
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,334
and you'll never forget me.

466
00:22:26,438 --> 00:22:28,463
I'll never forget you.

467
00:22:30,342 --> 00:22:35,758
Then you say that you have to go because you don't wanna start the

469
00:22:35,758 --> 00:22:38,238
year with me if you can't finish it.

470
00:22:44,356 --> 00:22:45,954
I'm gonna miss you,

471
00:22:45,954 --> 00:22:47,552
you scientist guy.

472
00:22:50,362 --> 00:22:52,353
Hi, Dick Clark in Times Square.

473
00:22:52,464 --> 00:22:54,915
We're in a virtual snowstorm

474
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,366
of confetti here in Times Square.

475
00:22:57,469 --> 00:22:59,369
It gets better every....

476
00:22:59,471 --> 00:23:01,405
Here you go, kids.

477
00:23:02,207 --> 00:23:04,402
And then the peacock bit me.

478
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,310
Please kiss me at midnight!

479
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:14,317
You seen Sandy?

480
00:23:14,317 --> 00:23:18,334
I don't know how to tell you this but she's in the bedroom

482
00:23:18,334 --> 00:23:20,347
getting it on with Max.

483
00:23:20,425 --> 00:23:23,223
Oh, I did know how to tell you.

484
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:25,893
Hey, everybody, the ball is dropping.

485
00:23:25,893 --> 00:23:27,457
What?

486
00:23:28,466 --> 00:23:31,458
The ball is dropping!

487
00:23:33,338 --> 00:23:35,465
In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.

488
00:23:36,241 --> 00:23:38,436
And the moment of joy is upon us.

489
00:23:39,344 --> 00:23:40,811
Looks like that no-date pact

490
00:23:40,811 --> 00:23:42,278
worked out.

491
00:23:42,447 --> 00:23:43,863
Everybody looks so happy.

492
00:23:43,863 --> 00:23:45,279
I hate that!

493
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,443
Not everybody is happy. Hey, Bobby!

494
00:23:47,485 --> 00:23:53,390
--four, three, two one! Happy New Year!

496
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,973
I thought I'd throw this out.

497
00:23:56,973 --> 00:24:01,765
I'm no math whiz but I do believe there are

499
00:24:01,765 --> 00:24:04,233
three girls and three guys right here.

500
00:24:05,303 --> 00:24:06,770
I don't feel like kissing

501
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,237
anyone tonight.

502
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:10,290
I can't kiss anyone.

503
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,241
So, I'm kissing everyone?

504
00:24:13,211 --> 00:24:14,724
No, you can't kiss Ross.

505
00:24:14,724 --> 00:24:16,237
That's your brother.

506
00:24:16,314 --> 00:24:17,411
So now everybody's

507
00:24:17,411 --> 00:24:18,508
getting kissed but me.

508
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,308
Somebody kiss me.

509
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:22,369
Somebody kiss me! It's midnight!

510
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:24,320
Somebody kiss me!

511
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:26,356
All right! All right!

512
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:28,350
There!

513
00:24:35,233 --> 00:24:37,360
I wanted this to work so much.

514
00:24:38,336 --> 00:24:40,236
I'm still in there.

515
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:41,767
Changing his diapers.

516
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:43,263
Picking his fleas.

517
00:24:43,475 --> 00:24:46,273
But he's just phoning it in.

518
00:24:48,246 --> 00:24:50,760
It's hard that something you love

519
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,274
so much doesn't love you back.

520
00:24:53,351 --> 00:24:56,377
I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
