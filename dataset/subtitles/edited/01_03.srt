1
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:05,832
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:05,832 --> 00:00:06,395
Hey, Phoebe.

3
00:00:07,204 --> 00:00:08,233
How did it go?

4
00:00:08,233 --> 00:00:09,262
Not so good.

5
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:10,886
He walked me home and said,

6
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:12,399
''Let's do this again.''

7
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:14,895
He said, ''Let's do this again.''

8
00:00:14,895 --> 00:00:16,379
That's good, right?

9
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:19,695
Translated, ''Let's do this again''

10
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:22,209
means, ''You'll never see me naked.''

11
00:00:23,287 --> 00:00:24,379
Since when?

12
00:00:25,222 --> 00:00:26,752
Since always.

13
00:00:26,752 --> 00:00:28,282
It's, like, dating language.

14
00:00:28,326 --> 00:00:29,856
Like, ''It's not you''

15
00:00:29,856 --> 00:00:31,386
means, ''It is you.''

16
00:00:33,197 --> 00:00:34,795
''You're nice'' means, ''I'll be

17
00:00:34,795 --> 00:00:38,213
dating alcoholics and complaining

18
00:00:38,213 --> 00:00:39,225
about them to you.''

19
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:41,267
''We should see

20
00:00:41,267 --> 00:00:42,330
other people'' means:

21
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,305
''Ha-ha, I already am!''

22
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,302
Everybody knows this?

23
00:00:48,312 --> 00:00:49,336
Cushions the blow.

24
00:00:49,413 --> 00:00:50,425
Like your parents

25
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:54,342
putting the dog to sleep and saying it went to a farm.

26
00:00:54,418 --> 00:00:55,914
That's funny. Because our

27
00:00:55,914 --> 00:01:01,382
parents actually did send our dog off to live on a farm.

28
00:01:02,193 --> 00:01:03,353
Ross?

29
00:01:05,196 --> 00:01:06,293
Hello! The Milner's farm

30
00:01:06,293 --> 00:01:07,390
in Connecticut?

31
00:01:08,165 --> 00:01:09,228
The Milners had this

32
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:10,291
unbelievable farm.

33
00:01:10,368 --> 00:01:11,784
They had horses and

34
00:01:11,784 --> 00:01:13,200
rabbits to chase.

35
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:14,396
And it was....

36
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:20,200
Oh, my God! Chi-Chi!

37
00:02:13,264 --> 00:02:14,731
How does it feel knowing

38
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:16,198
you're about to die?

39
00:02:16,267 --> 00:02:17,814
Warden, in five minutes

40
00:02:17,814 --> 00:02:19,361
my pain will be over.

41
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:22,270
But you'll live with the knowledge

42
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,369
that you sent an honest man to die.

43
00:02:26,177 --> 00:02:28,202
That was really good!

44
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:30,179
Thanks. Let's keep going.

45
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:32,249
So, what do you want

46
00:02:32,249 --> 00:02:34,217
from me, Dimon? Huh?

47
00:02:36,387 --> 00:02:38,383
I just wanna go back to my cell,

48
00:02:38,383 --> 00:02:40,379
because in my cell I can smoke.

49
00:02:41,192 --> 00:02:43,183
Smoke away!

50
00:02:55,506 --> 00:02:57,406
I think this is why Dimon

51
00:02:57,406 --> 00:02:59,306
smokes in his cell alone.

52
00:03:00,244 --> 00:03:01,256
What?

53
00:03:01,256 --> 00:03:02,268
Relax your hand.

54
00:03:02,346 --> 00:03:04,280
Let your wrist go.

55
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:06,248
Not so much!

56
00:03:07,351 --> 00:03:10,149
All right. Now take a puff.

57
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:12,152
Right.

58
00:03:14,191 --> 00:03:15,721
Give it to me.

59
00:03:15,721 --> 00:03:17,251
I'm not giving you a cigarette.

60
00:03:17,294 --> 00:03:19,273
It's fine. Do you want to

61
00:03:19,273 --> 00:03:21,252
get this part or not? Here.

62
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:22,861
Now, don't think

63
00:03:22,861 --> 00:03:24,357
of it as a cigarette.

64
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:26,801
Think of it as the thing that

65
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:29,201
has been missing from your hand.

66
00:03:29,373 --> 00:03:30,385
When you hold it,

67
00:03:30,385 --> 00:03:31,397
you feel right.

68
00:03:32,276 --> 00:03:33,265
You feel complete.

69
00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:35,275
You miss it?

70
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:36,372
No, not so much.

71
00:03:38,182 --> 00:03:41,174
All right. Now we smoke.

72
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,212
Oh, my God!

73
00:03:46,323 --> 00:03:47,307
Give me that!

74
00:03:47,307 --> 00:03:48,291
No. You've got options.

75
00:03:48,392 --> 00:03:50,223
You can smoke like this:

76
00:03:50,294 --> 00:03:51,340
Chandler--

77
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,386
Or hold it in your mouth.

78
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:54,226
Give me the cigarette!

79
00:03:54,331 --> 00:03:54,911
You try.

80
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:55,491
Thank you.

81
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:58,292
Okay, how's this?

82
00:04:01,138 --> 00:04:03,163
Okay, that's not bad.

83
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,253
All right, when you're finished,

84
00:04:05,253 --> 00:04:07,266
it's cool if you flick it.

85
00:04:09,246 --> 00:04:15,250
All right, you keep practicing and I'll go put out the sofa.

86
00:04:19,256 --> 00:04:21,281
I thought it was foot size.

87
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,326
No. It's the distance

88
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:28,297
from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.

89
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,361
That's ridiculous.

90
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:39,267
Can I use either thumb?

91
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:42,270
I'd rather go with the foot theory.

92
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:45,371
All right. Don't tell me.

93
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:49,377
Decaf cappuccino for Joey.

94
00:04:51,222 --> 00:04:53,190
Coffee, black.

95
00:04:53,424 --> 00:04:56,188
Latte.

96
00:04:57,228 --> 00:04:58,320
And an iced tea.

97
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,697
I'm getting good at this.

98
00:05:00,697 --> 00:05:02,164
Excellent!

99
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:03,325
Good for me!

100
00:05:17,348 --> 00:05:18,764
You okay, Phoebe?

101
00:05:18,764 --> 00:05:20,180
It's not worth--

102
00:05:20,284 --> 00:05:21,444
It's my bank.

103
00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:23,215
What did they do?

104
00:05:23,215 --> 00:05:24,244
It's nothing--

105
00:05:24,355 --> 00:05:26,272
I get my mail and

106
00:05:26,272 --> 00:05:28,189
open their monthly ''statement.''

107
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:30,192
Easy!

108
00:05:31,462 --> 00:05:34,363
And there's $500 extra in my account.

109
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:38,292
Satan's minions at work again!

110
00:05:38,402 --> 00:05:41,269
Now I have to go deal with them--

111
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:43,284
What are you talking about? Keep it!

112
00:05:43,284 --> 00:05:45,263
It's not mine.

113
00:05:45,376 --> 00:05:47,310
If I kept it, I'd be stealing.

114
00:05:47,378 --> 00:05:49,295
But if you spent it,

115
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:51,212
it would be like shopping.

116
00:05:53,284 --> 00:05:55,411
Say I bought a great pair of shoes.

117
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,671
Know what I'd hear with every step?

118
00:05:58,671 --> 00:06:01,122
''Not mine. Not mine. Not mine.''

119
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:02,738
Even if I was happy

120
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:04,251
and skipping, I'd hear:

121
00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:07,263
''Not-not mine. Not-not mine.''

122
00:06:07,331 --> 00:06:09,231
We're with you. We got it.

123
00:06:10,334 --> 00:06:12,330
I'd never be able to enjoy it.

124
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,326
It'd be this giant karmic debt.

125
00:06:14,371 --> 00:06:16,362
Chandler, what are you doing?

126
00:06:17,274 --> 00:06:19,265
What are you doing?

127
00:06:21,378 --> 00:06:24,279
Oh, gross!

128
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:25,814
What is this?

129
00:06:25,814 --> 00:06:27,247
I'm smoking!

130
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:30,149
You've been so good for three years!

131
00:06:30,254 --> 00:06:33,246
And this is my reward.

132
00:06:34,258 --> 00:06:35,754
Think about what you went

133
00:06:35,754 --> 00:06:37,250
through when you quit.

134
00:06:37,361 --> 00:06:39,278
Forget about you. Think about

135
00:06:39,278 --> 00:06:41,195
what we went through!

136
00:06:41,265 --> 00:06:43,358
So this time I won't quit.

137
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,833
Put it out!

138
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,266
I'm putting it out!

139
00:06:47,371 --> 00:06:48,463
Oh, no!

140
00:06:49,206 --> 00:06:51,299
I can't drink this now.

141
00:06:55,312 --> 00:06:57,303
I'm gonna go. I've got a date.

142
00:06:57,414 --> 00:06:58,779
With Alan again?

143
00:06:58,779 --> 00:07:00,144
How's it going?

144
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,246
It's going pretty good.

145
00:07:02,246 --> 00:07:04,242
It's nice and we're having fun.

146
00:07:04,355 --> 00:07:06,323
When do we get to meet him?

147
00:07:06,357 --> 00:07:08,325
Let's see, it's Monday....

148
00:07:08,425 --> 00:07:09,340
Never.

149
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,255
Come on!

150
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:12,352
Not after what happened with Steve.

151
00:07:13,163 --> 00:07:15,245
What do you mean?

152
00:07:15,245 --> 00:07:17,327
We love Steve. Steve was sexy!

153
00:07:20,337 --> 00:07:21,326
Sorry.

154
00:07:21,438 --> 00:07:22,934
I don't know how I feel yet.

155
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:24,430
Let me figure it out.

156
00:07:25,175 --> 00:07:27,143
Then can we meet him?

157
00:07:27,177 --> 00:07:28,166
No.

158
00:07:28,245 --> 00:07:30,145
Sorry.

159
00:07:32,282 --> 00:07:35,342
Joey. Let it go.

160
00:07:39,256 --> 00:07:40,348
Why should they meet him?

161
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:45,808
I bring a guy home and they're like coyotes picking off the weak

162
00:07:45,808 --> 00:07:47,355
members of the herd.

163
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:50,346
Listen, as someone who's seen

164
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:54,785
more than her share of bad beef I'll tell you,

165
00:07:54,785 --> 00:07:56,400
that is not such a terrible thing.

166
00:07:57,174 --> 00:07:58,237
Your friends are just

167
00:07:58,237 --> 00:07:59,300
looking after you.

168
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,258
I wish that once I'd date a guy

169
00:08:01,258 --> 00:08:03,106
they liked.

170
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:04,777
You realize the odds of that

171
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:08,732
happening are slimmer if they never get to meet the guy.

172
00:08:08,732 --> 00:08:10,313
I know.

173
00:08:10,354 --> 00:08:12,254
Can't I whimper a little bit?

174
00:08:12,254 --> 00:08:14,154
Whimper.

175
00:08:16,126 --> 00:08:17,423
Okay, I'm done.

176
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:20,253
Let it go, Ross.

177
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:23,131
You didn't know Chi-Chi.

178
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:28,303
Do you all promise?

179
00:08:28,303 --> 00:08:29,435
We promise.

180
00:08:30,174 --> 00:08:31,163
We'll be good.

181
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:34,335
Chandler, do you promise to be good?

182
00:08:42,152 --> 00:08:44,200
You can come in, but your

183
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,248
filter-tip buddy stays outside!

184
00:08:55,432 --> 00:08:57,297
''Dear Ms. Buffay.

185
00:08:57,297 --> 00:08:59,162
Thank you for calling.

186
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:01,248
We've credited you $500.

187
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:04,803
We're sorry for the inconvenience and hope you'll accept

188
00:09:04,803 --> 00:09:10,728
this football phone...as our gift.''

189
00:09:10,728 --> 00:09:12,110
Do you believe it?

190
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:13,679
Now I have $1000

191
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,209
and a football phone.

192
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,112
What bank is this?

193
00:09:20,224 --> 00:09:22,317
Okay, it's him.

194
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:24,639
Who is it?

195
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,151
-Alan.

196
00:09:25,229 --> 00:09:27,129
Chandler! He's here!

197
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:31,156
Do I look okay?

198
00:09:32,135 --> 00:09:33,227
One more button.

199
00:09:33,337 --> 00:09:35,271
Closed! How about closed?

200
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,307
I didn't know.

201
00:09:37,307 --> 00:09:38,274
Yeah.

202
00:09:39,443 --> 00:09:41,343
Please be good.

203
00:09:41,378 --> 00:09:44,347
Remember how much you all like me?

204
00:09:46,183 --> 00:09:48,265
Alan, this is everybody.

205
00:09:48,265 --> 00:09:50,347
Everybody, this is Alan.

206
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,838
I've heard so much about

207
00:09:55,838 --> 00:09:57,385
all you guys.

208
00:10:04,368 --> 00:10:07,269
I'll call you tomorrow. Thanks.

209
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:14,268
Let's let the Alan-bashing begin.

210
00:10:14,378 --> 00:10:17,211
Who's gonna take the first shot?

211
00:10:18,282 --> 00:10:19,306
Come on!

212
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:22,285
I'll go.

213
00:10:24,321 --> 00:10:25,367
Let's start with how he

214
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:26,413
kept picking--

215
00:10:27,224 --> 00:10:28,754
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

216
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,284
We loved him.

217
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:32,328
We loved him!

218
00:10:32,396 --> 00:10:34,347
Wait! We're talking about someone

219
00:10:34,347 --> 00:10:36,298
I'm going out with?

220
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,197
That pimento trick!

221
00:10:38,302 --> 00:10:39,815
I'll never look at an olive

222
00:10:39,815 --> 00:10:41,328
the same way again.

223
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:43,303
And did you notice?

224
00:10:48,345 --> 00:10:49,829
Know what was great?

225
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:51,313
His smile was crooked.

226
00:10:51,415 --> 00:10:53,411
Yes! Like the man in the shoe!

227
00:10:53,411 --> 00:10:55,407
What shoe?

228
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,312
From the rhyme.

229
00:10:58,422 --> 00:10:59,354
There was a man

230
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:00,286
With a crooked smile

231
00:11:00,357 --> 00:11:02,274
Who lived in a shoe

232
00:11:02,274 --> 00:11:04,191
For a while

233
00:11:06,363 --> 00:11:11,229
So I think Alan is the yardstick by which

234
00:11:11,229 --> 00:11:13,259
future boyfriends will be measured.

235
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,359
Future boyfriends?

236
00:11:15,172 --> 00:11:16,719
I think this could be ''it.''

237
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:18,266
Really?

238
00:11:18,308 --> 00:11:20,287
I'd marry him for his

239
00:11:20,287 --> 00:11:22,266
David Hasselhoff impression alone.

240
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:23,796
You know I'll be doing that

241
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:25,280
at parties.

242
00:11:29,186 --> 00:11:30,249
Know what I like most?

243
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:31,312
What?

244
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:35,383
The way he makes me feel about myself.

245
00:11:57,447 --> 00:11:59,438
How was the game?

246
00:12:00,183 --> 00:12:01,275
Well....

247
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:04,252
We won!

248
00:12:05,188 --> 00:12:06,672
Fantastic! Question.

249
00:12:06,672 --> 00:12:08,156
How is that possible?

250
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,205
Alan.

251
00:12:10,205 --> 00:12:11,251
He was unbelievable!

252
00:12:11,294 --> 00:12:13,245
Like the cartoon where

253
00:12:13,245 --> 00:12:15,196
Bugs Bunny plays every position.

254
00:12:15,265 --> 00:12:17,313
It was first base, Alan.

255
00:12:17,313 --> 00:12:19,361
Second base, Alan....

256
00:12:23,173 --> 00:12:25,403
It was like he made us into a team.

257
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:28,673
We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers

258
00:12:28,673 --> 00:12:31,170
a thing or two about softball.

259
00:12:32,215 --> 00:12:33,477
Can I ask a question?

260
00:12:34,217 --> 00:12:36,310
Do you think Alan is sometimes....

261
00:12:36,386 --> 00:12:37,375
What?

262
00:12:37,487 --> 00:12:40,320
I don't know. A little too ''Alan''?

263
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:42,341
Oh, no. Not possible.

264
00:12:42,341 --> 00:12:44,292
You can never be too ''Alan.''

265
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:46,807
It's his innate ''Alan-ness''

266
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,287
that we adore.

267
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:50,828
I, personally, could have

268
00:12:50,828 --> 00:12:52,324
a gallon of Alan.

269
00:13:00,177 --> 00:13:01,223
Hey, Lizzy.

270
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:02,269
Hey, weird girl.

271
00:13:03,246 --> 00:13:04,292
I brought alphabet soup.

272
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:05,338
Pick out the vowels?

273
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:07,645
I left in the Y's.

274
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:09,141
Because, ''sometimes Y.''

275
00:13:10,253 --> 00:13:11,299
And something else.

276
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:12,345
Saltines?

277
00:13:12,456 --> 00:13:15,186
No, $1000 and a football phone.

278
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,183
What?

279
00:13:18,261 --> 00:13:19,387
Oh, my God!

280
00:13:20,197 --> 00:13:21,294
There's really money in here.

281
00:13:21,294 --> 00:13:22,391
I know.

282
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,360
What are you doing?

283
00:13:25,168 --> 00:13:26,732
I want you to have it.

284
00:13:26,732 --> 00:13:28,296
I don't want it.

285
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:29,901
I have to give you something.

286
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:31,397
No, you don't--

287
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:33,790
Do you want my tinfoil hat?

288
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,371
No, you need that.

289
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:36,929
It's okay. Thanks.

290
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:38,379
Let me do something.

291
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:42,213
I'll tell you what. Buy me

292
00:13:42,213 --> 00:13:44,209
a soda and we're even. Okay?

293
00:13:45,222 --> 00:13:45,819
Okay.

294
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:46,416
Okay.

295
00:14:48,285 --> 00:14:50,276
Keep the change.

296
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,309
Thanks, Lizzy.

297
00:14:51,388 --> 00:14:52,412
Want a pretzel?

298
00:14:53,223 --> 00:14:54,707
No, I'm fine. Thanks.

299
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:56,191
See you.

300
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:06,226
A thumb?

301
00:15:07,337 --> 00:15:08,833
I know. There it was,

302
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:14,240
just floating like this tiny little hitchhiker.

303
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:17,241
Maybe it's a contest.

304
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:19,237
Like ''collect all five.''

305
00:15:20,283 --> 00:15:21,767
Does anyone wanna see?

306
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:23,251
No, thanks!

307
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:26,381
Don't do that. Come on!

308
00:15:27,157 --> 00:15:29,352
It's worse than the thumb.

309
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:32,258
This is so unfair.

310
00:15:32,258 --> 00:15:33,355
Why is it unfair?

311
00:15:34,164 --> 00:15:36,359
So I have a flaw! Big deal!

312
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:38,264
Joey's knuckle-cracking

313
00:15:38,264 --> 00:15:39,361
isn't annoying?

314
00:15:39,402 --> 00:15:42,166
Ross, over-pronouncing every word.

315
00:15:42,205 --> 00:15:44,804
Monica, who snorts when she laughs.

316
00:15:44,804 --> 00:15:47,403
I mean, what the hell is that thing?

317
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:50,811
I accept those flaws.

318
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:53,211
Why can't you accept me for this?

319
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:01,268
Does the knuckle-cracking

320
00:16:01,268 --> 00:16:03,247
bother everybody, or just him?

321
00:16:06,229 --> 00:16:08,163
I could live without it.

322
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:13,648
Is it a little annoying? Or is it like

323
00:16:13,648 --> 00:16:16,162
when Phoebe chews her hair?

324
00:16:18,341 --> 00:16:19,837
Don't listen to him.

325
00:16:19,837 --> 00:16:21,333
I think it's endearing.

326
00:16:22,145 --> 00:16:24,170
Oh, you do, do you?

327
00:16:30,253 --> 00:16:31,766
There's nothing wrong with

328
00:16:31,766 --> 00:16:33,279
speaking correctly.

329
00:16:33,456 --> 00:16:36,289
Indeed there isn't.

330
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:40,261
I should get back to work.

331
00:16:40,363 --> 00:16:42,314
Otherwise someone might

332
00:16:42,314 --> 00:16:44,265
get what they ordered.

333
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:48,299
The hair comes out

334
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,295
and the gloves come off.

335
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:06,333
Ever go out with a guy

336
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,312
your friends really like?

337
00:17:08,358 --> 00:17:10,258
No.

338
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:14,294
I'm going out with a guy

339
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:16,159
my friends really like.

340
00:17:16,232 --> 00:17:19,224
Are we talking about the coyotes here?

341
00:17:19,336 --> 00:17:23,238
All right! A cow got through.

342
00:17:24,174 --> 00:17:25,232
Can you believe it?

343
00:17:25,342 --> 00:17:27,207
It's just, you know what?

344
00:17:27,277 --> 00:17:30,212
I just don't feel the ''thing.''

345
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,147
They feel the thing. I don't feel it.

346
00:17:33,249 --> 00:17:35,717
Honey, you should always

347
00:17:35,717 --> 00:17:38,185
feel the thing.

348
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,290
If that's how you feel about the guy,

349
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,190
dump him.

350
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,824
It's gonna be really hard.

351
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:47,388
He'll get over it.

352
00:17:48,164 --> 00:17:50,661
No, he'll be fine. It's the other five

353
00:17:50,661 --> 00:17:53,158
I'm worried about.

354
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:55,265
Don't you respect your body?

355
00:17:55,265 --> 00:17:57,261
Don't you see what you're doing?

356
00:17:57,374 --> 00:17:59,308
I've had it with your cancer,

357
00:17:59,308 --> 00:18:01,242
emphysema and heart disease.

358
00:18:02,112 --> 00:18:04,108
The bottom line is, smoking is cool,

359
00:18:04,108 --> 00:18:06,104
and you know it.

360
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:11,253
Alan wants to speak to you.

361
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:13,346
Really? He does?

362
00:18:14,357 --> 00:18:17,258
Hey, buddy! What's up?

363
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:21,120
She told you about that, huh?

364
00:18:21,364 --> 00:18:23,747
Well, yeah. I have one now and then.

365
00:18:23,747 --> 00:18:26,130
Well, yeah, now.

366
00:18:27,137 --> 00:18:28,365
It's not that--

367
00:18:30,373 --> 00:18:32,341
Well, that's true.

368
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:37,158
Gee, you know, no one's ever put it

369
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,171
like that before.

370
00:18:39,282 --> 00:18:42,149
Well, okay. Thanks.

371
00:18:51,394 --> 00:18:54,158
God, he's good.

372
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:56,315
If only he were a woman.

373
00:18:56,315 --> 00:18:58,266
Yeah.

374
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:04,295
Lamb Chop!

375
00:19:05,108 --> 00:19:08,134
How old is that sock?

376
00:19:08,244 --> 00:19:10,274
If I had a sock on my hand

377
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,304
for 30 years, it'd be talking too.

378
00:19:14,317 --> 00:19:16,734
I think it's time to change somebody's

379
00:19:16,734 --> 00:19:19,151
nicotine patch.

380
00:19:22,358 --> 00:19:23,842
Where's Joey?

381
00:19:23,842 --> 00:19:27,352
Joey ate my last stick of gum so I killed him.

382
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:30,256
Do you think that was wrong?

383
00:19:32,135 --> 00:19:33,232
I think he's across the hall.

384
00:19:33,232 --> 00:19:34,329
Thanks.

385
00:19:35,238 --> 00:19:37,229
There you go.

386
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,332
I'm alive with pleasure now.

387
00:19:40,376 --> 00:19:42,327
Pheebs, do you want

388
00:19:42,327 --> 00:19:44,278
the rest of that Pop-Tart?

389
00:19:45,381 --> 00:19:46,865
Does anyone want

390
00:19:46,865 --> 00:19:48,349
the rest of this Pop-Tart?

391
00:19:50,186 --> 00:19:52,154
Hey, I might.

392
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:54,246
I'm sorry.

393
00:19:54,357 --> 00:19:56,757
The soda people gave me $ 7000

394
00:19:56,757 --> 00:19:59,157
for the thumb.

395
00:20:00,296 --> 00:20:01,826
And on my way over here

396
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,356
I stepped in gum.

397
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:06,292
What is up with the universe?

398
00:20:06,402 --> 00:20:08,398
What's going on?

399
00:20:08,398 --> 00:20:10,394
It's just nice when we're together.

400
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:12,754
It's nicer when everyone

401
00:20:12,754 --> 00:20:14,301
gets to wear underwear.

402
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,184
Please, guys, we have to talk.

403
00:20:27,223 --> 00:20:29,487
Wait! I'm getting a déjà vu.

404
00:20:30,226 --> 00:20:31,284
No, I'm not.

405
00:20:34,197 --> 00:20:35,693
We have to talk.

406
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,189
There it is!

407
00:20:39,402 --> 00:20:41,336
Okay, it's about Alan.

408
00:20:41,404 --> 00:20:43,821
Speaking of which, tell him

409
00:20:43,821 --> 00:20:46,238
we're on for the Renaissance Fair.

410
00:20:46,342 --> 00:20:48,372
Before you get into that,

411
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,402
there's something you should know.

412
00:20:51,314 --> 00:20:53,282
There's really no easy way

413
00:20:53,282 --> 00:20:55,250
to say this.

414
00:20:56,352 --> 00:20:59,412
I've decided to break up with Alan.

415
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:06,160
Is there somebody else?

416
00:21:07,463 --> 00:21:11,315
No, it's just you know, things change.

417
00:21:11,315 --> 00:21:12,464
People change.

418
00:21:13,203 --> 00:21:15,296
We didn't change.

419
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:20,399
So that's it? It's over?

420
00:21:21,277 --> 00:21:23,268
Just like that?

421
00:21:24,314 --> 00:21:26,845
You let your guard down. You start

422
00:21:26,845 --> 00:21:29,376
to care about someone, and....

423
00:21:32,422 --> 00:21:33,804
I can go on pretending--

424
00:21:33,804 --> 00:21:35,186
Okay!

425
00:21:35,225 --> 00:21:36,283
No.

426
00:21:36,326 --> 00:21:37,856
That wouldn't be fair to me, Alan,

427
00:21:37,856 --> 00:21:39,386
or to you.

428
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:41,420
Well, who wants fair?

429
00:21:42,198 --> 00:21:44,211
I just want things back, you know,

430
00:21:44,211 --> 00:21:46,224
the way they were.

431
00:21:48,238 --> 00:21:50,268
I'm sorry.

432
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:52,298
Oh, she's sorry. I feel better.

433
00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:55,240
I can't believe this!

434
00:21:55,311 --> 00:21:57,779
With the holidays coming up.

435
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:00,247
I wanted him to meet my family.

436
00:22:01,251 --> 00:22:02,718
I'll meet someone.

437
00:22:02,718 --> 00:22:04,185
There'll be other Alans.

438
00:22:04,254 --> 00:22:05,278
Yeah, right!

439
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,211
Are you guys gonna be okay?

440
00:22:12,211 --> 00:22:14,162
We'll be fine.

441
00:22:14,197 --> 00:22:16,358
We're just gonna need a little time.

442
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:19,392
I understand.

443
00:22:24,374 --> 00:22:25,773
Wow.

444
00:22:25,773 --> 00:22:27,172
I'm really sorry.

445
00:22:27,277 --> 00:22:30,269
Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry too.

446
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,893
But I'm a little relieved.

447
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,406
Relieved?

448
00:22:34,217 --> 00:22:35,798
Yeah, well, I mean,

449
00:22:35,798 --> 00:22:37,379
I had a great time with you.

450
00:22:38,288 --> 00:22:41,223
I just can't stand your friends.

451
00:22:47,196 --> 00:22:48,811
Remember when we went to Central Park

452
00:22:48,811 --> 00:22:50,426
and rented boats?

453
00:22:52,335 --> 00:22:54,394
That was fun.

454
00:22:55,405 --> 00:22:58,397
He could row like a Viking.

455
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,243
So how'd it go?

456
00:23:09,452 --> 00:23:11,352
You know.

457
00:23:11,387 --> 00:23:14,185
Did he mention us?

458
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:19,757
He says he's really gonna

459
00:23:19,757 --> 00:23:21,253
miss you guys.

460
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,786
Rough day, huh?

461
00:23:28,786 --> 00:23:30,202
You have no idea.

462
00:23:30,273 --> 00:23:32,264
Come here.

463
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:36,341
That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.

464
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:37,404
No!

465
00:23:38,181 --> 00:23:40,274
I don't care! I'm weak!

466
00:23:40,316 --> 00:23:42,284
I've gotta have the smoke!

467
00:23:42,385 --> 00:23:44,336
If you never smoke again,

468
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:46,287
I'll give you $ 7000.

469
00:23:46,322 --> 00:23:48,290
Yeah, all right.
