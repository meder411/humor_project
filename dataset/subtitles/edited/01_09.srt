1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,954
Terry, I know I haven't worked here

2
00:00:09,954 --> 00:00:14,759
very long but would it be possible if I got a $100 advance

3
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,272
on my salary?

4
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:18,246
An advance?

5
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,818
So I can spend

6
00:00:19,818 --> 00:00:21,285
Thanksgiving with my family.

7
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,367
Every year we ski in Vail,

8
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:25,380
and my father pays for my ticket.

9
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,954
But I've started

10
00:00:26,954 --> 00:00:30,758
this independent thing which is actually why

11
00:00:30,758 --> 00:00:32,254
I took this ''job.''

12
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:36,367
Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart!

13
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:39,464
You're a terrible, terrible waitress.

14
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:43,274
Really, really awful.

15
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:45,990
I hear what you're saying.

16
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,503
I'm with you.

17
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,899
But I'm trying really hard,

18
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:54,282
and I think I'm doing better.

19
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,412
I really do.

20
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:57,985
Does anybody need coffee?

21
00:00:57,985 --> 00:00:59,481
Yeah, over here.

22
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,287
Look at that.

23
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,877
Excuse me, sir? Hi.

24
00:01:54,877 --> 00:01:56,475
You come in here all the time.

25
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,366
Do you think there's a possibility

26
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:02,216
that you could advance me my tips?

27
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,804
Okay, okay. That's fine. Fine.

28
00:02:05,804 --> 00:02:08,352
Sorry about that spill before!

29
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,420
Only 98.50 to go!

30
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,365
Did you know Mom and Dad are going

31
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:17,464
to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?

32
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,250
What? No, they're not.

33
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,229
Yes, the Blymans invited them.

34
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:23,468
You're wrong.

35
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,360
I am not wrong.

36
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,243
You're wrong.

37
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,349
No, I just talked to them.

38
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,243
I'm calling Mom.

39
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:39,420
Hey, hey.

40
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,449
Hey!

41
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:44,775
And this from the Cry for Help

42
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:47,255
Department: Are you wearing makeup?

43
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:51,399
Yes, I am. As of today, I'm officially

44
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:54,397
Joey Tribbiani, actor/model.

45
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,408
That's funny. I was thinking you look

46
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:00,309
more like, Joey Tribbiani, man/woman.

47
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,282
What were you modeling for?

48
00:03:03,282 --> 00:03:05,250
Posters for the free clinic.

49
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,285
So you're gonna be one

50
00:03:07,285 --> 00:03:09,219
of those healthy guys?

51
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,251
The asthma guy's really cute.

52
00:03:11,251 --> 00:03:13,247
Know which one you'll be?

53
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,355
No, but I hear Lyme disease

54
00:03:15,355 --> 00:03:17,351
is open, so you know....

55
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,347
Good luck, man. I hope you get it.

56
00:03:19,347 --> 00:03:21,264
Thanks.

57
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:27,234
You were right. How can they do this?

58
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:29,230
It's Thanksgiving!

59
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,357
What if I cook dinner at my place?

60
00:03:31,357 --> 00:03:33,439
I'll make it just like Mom's.

61
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,760
Will you make mashed potatoes

62
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,273
with the lumps?

63
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,917
They're not actually supposed to--

64
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:42,351
I'll work on the lumps.

65
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,284
Joey, you're going home?

66
00:03:44,284 --> 00:03:45,279
Yeah.

67
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,406
Chandler, you're still boycotting

68
00:03:47,406 --> 00:03:49,454
all the pilgrim holidays?

69
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,444
Every single one of them.

70
00:03:52,444 --> 00:03:54,492
Phoebe, you'll be with your grandma?

71
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,360
And her boyfriend.

72
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,482
We're celebrating Thanksgiving

73
00:03:58,482 --> 00:04:00,495
in December because he's lunar.

74
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,304
So you're free Thursday then?

75
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,393
Yeah. Oh, can I come?

76
00:04:08,393 --> 00:04:09,439
Yeah.

77
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,882
Rach, are you gonna make it to Vail?

78
00:04:13,882 --> 00:04:16,413
Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop.

79
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:18,821
Only $102 to go.

80
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:20,419
I thought it was 98.50?

81
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,439
Yeah, well, it was, but I--

82
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:24,418
I broke a cup, so....

83
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,313
Well, I'm off to Carol's.

84
00:04:27,313 --> 00:04:29,361
Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?

85
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,836
Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife

86
00:04:32,836 --> 00:04:38,242
and will want to bring her ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.

87
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,244
Hi. Is Carol here?

88
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,920
No, she's at a faculty meeting.

89
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,485
I just came by to pick up my skull.

90
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:58,287
Well, not mine, but....

91
00:04:58,498 --> 00:04:59,413
Come in.

92
00:04:59,413 --> 00:05:00,328
Thanks.

93
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,413
Carol borrowed it, and I have

94
00:05:02,413 --> 00:05:04,426
to get it back to the museum.

95
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,718
What's it look like?

96
00:05:07,718 --> 00:05:10,198
Kind of like a big face without skin.

97
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:15,244
Yes. I'm familiar with the concept.

98
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,781
We can just look for it.

99
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:18,214
Okay.

100
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,804
Wow, you guys sure have a lot

101
00:05:25,804 --> 00:05:28,352
of books about being a lesbian.

102
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,329
Well, you know,

103
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:35,428
you have to take a course.

104
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,328
Otherwise they don't let you do it.

105
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:50,443
Hey, Yertle the Turtle! A classic.

106
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,447
Actually, I'm reading it to the baby.

107
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:59,247
The baby that hasn't been born yet?

108
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,294
Wouldn't that mean you're crazy?

109
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,760
You don't think

110
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,290
they can hear sounds in there?

111
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,396
You're not serious?

112
00:06:09,396 --> 00:06:11,392
I mean, you really talk to it?

113
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,320
Yeah, all the time.

114
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,402
I want the baby to know my voice.

115
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,812
Well, that's just--

116
00:06:21,812 --> 00:06:24,212
Do you talk about me?

117
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,365
Yeah. All the time.

118
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:28,213
Really?

119
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,869
But, we just refer to you

120
00:06:30,869 --> 00:06:33,417
as ''Bobo the Sperm Guy.''

121
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,818
If she's talking to it, I just think

122
00:06:46,818 --> 00:06:49,366
I should get some belly time too.

123
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,433
Not that I believe this.

124
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,428
I believe it. I think the baby

125
00:06:53,428 --> 00:06:55,379
can hear everything.

126
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,915
Really?

127
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:58,382
I'll show you. This'll seem weird.

128
00:06:58,484 --> 00:06:59,951
But you put your head

129
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:04,300
inside this turkey and we'll all talk

130
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,279
and you'll hear everything we say.

131
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:09,760
I'd just like to say I'm totally

132
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,194
behind this experiment.

133
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,266
In fact, I'd very much like

134
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:16,234
to butter your head.

135
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:20,771
Hey.

136
00:07:20,771 --> 00:07:22,204
Rach, did you make your money?

137
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,276
No, not even close. Forget Vail.

138
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:26,244
Forget seeing my family.

139
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:30,213
Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.

140
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,352
Rach, here's your mail.

141
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:37,253
Thanks. You can put it on the table.

142
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:41,225
No. Here's your mail!

143
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,454
Thanks. You can put it on the table!

144
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,257
Would you just open it!

145
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:55,466
Oh, my God! You guys are great!

146
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,335
We all chipped in.

147
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,776
We did?

148
00:07:59,776 --> 00:08:01,175
You owe me $20.

149
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,407
Thank you. Thank you so much!

150
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,832
Chandler, got your traditional

151
00:08:05,832 --> 00:08:10,217
holiday feast. Tomato soup grilled-cheese fixings

152
00:08:10,217 --> 00:08:12,213
and a family-size bag of Funyuns.

153
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,856
This is your Thanksgiving dinner?

154
00:08:14,856 --> 00:08:17,421
What is it with you and this holiday?

155
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,711
I'm 9 years old.

156
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:22,224
I hate this story!

157
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,365
We've finished this magnificent

158
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:29,197
Thanksgiving dinner. I have a mouthful of pumpkin pie.

159
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,259
And then my parents tell me

160
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,210
they're getting divorced.

161
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,336
Oh, my God!

162
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,331
Very difficult to enjoy Thanksgiving

163
00:08:37,331 --> 00:08:40,215
dinner once you've seen it in reverse.

164
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,406
What's this?

165
00:08:44,406 --> 00:08:46,357
I never saw this at Mom's.

166
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,909
It's a yam.

167
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:49,359
Hello....

168
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,894
This isn't a yam.

169
00:08:52,894 --> 00:08:55,425
Yam comes in purple cans.

170
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:59,261
They don't-- They don't come in these.

171
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,872
Ross, don't take this the wrong way

172
00:09:01,872 --> 00:09:04,272
or anything, but back off.

173
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,316
Hi.

174
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,843
We used to work together.

175
00:09:21,843 --> 00:09:23,293
We did?

176
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,313
Yeah, at Macy's.

177
00:09:25,313 --> 00:09:27,230
You're the Obsession girl, right?

178
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,796
Yes.

179
00:09:28,796 --> 00:09:30,292
I was the Aramis guy.

180
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,801
Aramis. Aramis. Aramis.

181
00:09:33,801 --> 00:09:36,298
Yeah, right!

182
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,790
You're the best in the business.

183
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,337
Get out.

184
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,926
You're amazing! You know when

185
00:09:42,926 --> 00:09:45,406
to spritz. You know when to lay back.

186
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:47,833
Really? You don't know

187
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:49,448
what that means to me.

188
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,975
You smell great tonight.

189
00:09:53,975 --> 00:09:56,426
What are you wearing?

190
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,327
Nothing.

191
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,341
Listen, do you wanna go get a drink?

192
00:10:10,341 --> 00:10:13,242
Yeah, that would be--

193
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:15,911
What's wrong?

194
00:10:15,911 --> 00:10:17,475
I have to do something.

195
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,376
What?

196
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,505
Leave.

197
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:25,456
Wait, wait, wait!

198
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,326
So I guess you all saw it.

199
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:10,982
What?

200
00:11:10,982 --> 00:11:11,528
Saw what?

201
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,370
No, we're just laughing. You know

202
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,469
how laughter can be infectious.

203
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,975
Set another place for Thanksgiving.

204
00:11:37,975 --> 00:11:40,489
My entire family thinks I have VD.

205
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,269
''Tonight, on a very special Blossom. ''

206
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,506
Looking good! Okay!

207
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,380
Cider's mulling, turkey's turkeying,

208
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,479
yams are yamming....

209
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,412
What?

210
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:03,905
I don't know. It's just not

211
00:12:03,905 --> 00:12:06,356
the same without Mom in the kitchen.

212
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,257
Get out and stop annoying me!

213
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,262
Oh, that's closer.

214
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,331
I got the tickets!

215
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,429
Five hours from now,

216
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:18,425
shoop, shoop, shoop!

217
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,937
Oh, you must stop shooping.

218
00:12:20,937 --> 00:12:23,337
Okay, I'm gonna get my stuff.

219
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,239
Will you come in?

220
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,357
I prefer to keep a safe distance

221
00:12:27,357 --> 00:12:29,370
from all this merriment.

222
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:33,350
Look out! Incoming pumpkin pie!

223
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,909
We laughed when you did it with

224
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:44,360
the stuffing, but that's not funny.

225
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,312
Hey, Monica, I got a question.

226
00:12:47,312 --> 00:12:49,360
I don't see any Tator Tots.

227
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,835
That's not a question.

228
00:12:51,835 --> 00:12:54,269
My mom makes them. It's a tradition.

229
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,921
You get a piece of turkey on your fork,

230
00:12:56,921 --> 00:12:59,469
a little cranberry sauce and a Tot!

231
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:03,310
I mean, it's bad enough I can't be

232
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:06,308
with my family because of my disease.

233
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,216
All right. Fine.

234
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:12,290
Tonight's potatoes will be mashed,

235
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,259
with lumps and in the form of Tots.

236
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,810
All right, I'm off

237
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,357
to talk to my unborn child.

238
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,327
Okay, Mom never hit.

239
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,433
Okay, all done.

240
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,973
Phoebe, did you whip the pota--?

241
00:13:32,973 --> 00:13:35,470
Ross needs lumps!

242
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,442
Oh, I'm sorry! I just--

243
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,764
I thought we could have them whipped

244
00:13:40,764 --> 00:13:43,278
and then add some peas and onions.

245
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,447
Why do that?

246
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,771
Because then they'd be just like my

247
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:50,285
mom used to make it, before she died.

248
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,476
Okay. Three kinds

249
00:13:53,476 --> 00:13:55,455
of potatoes coming up.

250
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,833
Okay. Goodbye, you guys!

251
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,397
Thanks for everything!

252
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,203
Oh, God, look at--

253
00:14:03,203 --> 00:14:05,199
Sorry! I'm so sorry.

254
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,224
An unbelievable thing happened!

255
00:14:08,224 --> 00:14:10,203
Underdog got away!

256
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,381
The balloon?

257
00:14:12,381 --> 00:14:14,446
No, no, the actual cartoon character.

258
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:18,222
Of course the balloon!

259
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,775
He broke free and was spotted

260
00:14:20,775 --> 00:14:23,226
flying over Washington Square Park.

261
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,860
I'm going to the roof. Who's with me?

262
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,458
I can't!

263
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,229
An 80-foot dog over the city?

264
00:14:29,229 --> 00:14:31,225
How often does that happen?

265
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,429
Almost never.

266
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,835
Got the keys?

267
00:14:34,835 --> 00:14:36,331
Okay.

268
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,339
Anytime you're ready.

269
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:47,250
Okay. Okay, here we go.

270
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:55,288
Okay. Where am I talking to here?

271
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:58,344
There is one way that offers a

272
00:14:58,344 --> 00:15:00,426
certain acoustical advantage, but....

273
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,198
Just aim for the bump.

274
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,427
Okay.

275
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:10,240
Okay. Okay. Okay, here goes.

276
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:21,308
You know, I can't do this. This is--

277
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:24,322
It's too weird. I feel stupid.

278
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,840
It's fine. You don't have to do it

279
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,257
just because Susan does it.

280
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:33,320
Hello, baby. Hello. Hello.

281
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,296
-the moment we first saw

282
00:15:36,296 --> 00:15:38,326
the dog shadow fall over the park!

283
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,366
But did they have to shoot him down?

284
00:15:40,366 --> 00:15:42,362
That was just mean.

285
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,254
Right now the turkey should

286
00:15:45,254 --> 00:15:49,439
be crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.

287
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,476
Why are we standing here?

288
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,263
We're waiting for you to open

289
00:15:54,263 --> 00:15:56,242
the door. You have the keys.

290
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,481
No, I don't.

291
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,407
Yes, you do. When we left,

292
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:02,324
you said, ''Got the keys.''

293
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:07,289
No, I didn't. I asked, ''Got the keys?''

294
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:11,293
No, no, no. You said, ''Got the keys!''

295
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:14,431
Do either of you have the keys?

296
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:16,903
The oven is on!

297
00:16:16,903 --> 00:16:18,399
I've gotta get my ticket!

298
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:19,940
Wait! We have a copy of your key.

299
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,436
Get it!

300
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,512
That tone won't make me go any faster.

301
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,279
Joey.

302
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:27,308
That one will.

303
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,735
And everyone's telling me,

304
00:16:32,735 --> 00:16:35,215
''You gotta pick a major.''

305
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,458
So on a dare, I picked paleontology.

306
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:42,797
And you have no idea what I'm saying,

307
00:16:42,797 --> 00:16:45,362
because, face it, you're a fetus.

308
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:47,968
You're happy you don't

309
00:16:47,968 --> 00:16:49,464
have gills anymore.

310
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,772
You don't have to talk to it.

311
00:16:52,772 --> 00:16:54,268
You can sing--

312
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,297
Please. I am not singing

313
00:16:56,297 --> 00:16:58,248
to your stomach, okay?

314
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,284
How's it going?

315
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,286
Here we come

316
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,379
Walking down the street

317
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,805
Get the funniest looks from

318
00:17:06,805 --> 00:17:08,420
Everyone we meet

319
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,388
Hey, hey--

320
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,816
Hey, did you just feel that?

321
00:17:14,816 --> 00:17:16,300
I did.

322
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:17,852
Does it always--?

323
00:17:17,852 --> 00:17:19,302
That was the first.

324
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,396
Keep singing! Keep singing!

325
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,840
Hey, hey, you're my baby

326
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,240
And I can't wait to meet you

327
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,376
When you come out I'll buy you a bagel

328
00:17:28,376 --> 00:17:30,441
Then we'll go to the zoo

329
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,330
It did it again!

330
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:33,410
I felt it that time!

331
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,936
Hey, hey, I'm your daddy

332
00:17:35,936 --> 00:17:38,353
I'm the one without any breasts

333
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,359
This is great. It's 5:00. My plane

334
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:46,424
is pulling away from the gate.

335
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,779
Maybe you can take a later flight.

336
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:50,326
There is none.

337
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,370
You can go tomorrow.

338
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,304
Tomorrow is not Thanksgiving!

339
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,369
If I'm gonna cheer you up,

340
00:17:56,369 --> 00:17:58,365
you have to meet me halfway.

341
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,242
Can you go any faster?

342
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,376
I got one keyhole and a zillion keys!

343
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:05,372
You do the math.

344
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,351
Why do you guys have so many

345
00:18:07,351 --> 00:18:09,285
keys in there anyway?

346
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,186
For an emergency just like this.

347
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,291
All right. Listen, smirky!

348
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:17,345
If not for your stupid balloon,

349
00:18:17,345 --> 00:18:21,310
I'd be on a plane watching a woman do this...right

350
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,289
now. But I'm not!

351
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,337
You said you had the keys!

352
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,856
No, I didn't! I wouldn't say I had

353
00:18:28,856 --> 00:18:31,307
the keys unless I had the keys!

354
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:33,339
That's it! Enough with the keys.

355
00:18:33,339 --> 00:18:35,335
No one say keys!

356
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,317
Why would I have the keys?!

357
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:41,882
Aside from the fact you said you did?

358
00:18:41,882 --> 00:18:43,412
I didn't!

359
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:44,769
You should've.

360
00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:45,315
Why?

361
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:45,851
Because!

362
00:18:45,851 --> 00:18:46,345
Why?

363
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,893
Everything's my responsibility?

364
00:18:48,893 --> 00:18:51,361
Isn't it enough that I'm making dinner?

365
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,443
Everyone wants a different kind

366
00:18:53,443 --> 00:18:55,456
of potato, so I'm making them.

367
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,719
Does anybody care what kind

368
00:18:58,719 --> 00:19:01,170
of potatoes I want? No!

369
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,173
No! No!

370
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,772
Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas

371
00:19:05,772 --> 00:19:08,269
and onions, and Mario gets his Tots--

372
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:12,306
It's my first Thanksgiving, and I--

373
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:15,409
It's all burnt, and I can't....

374
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,257
Monica, only dogs can hear you now.

375
00:19:20,257 --> 00:19:23,192
Look, the door's open. Here we go.

376
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,717
All right, Chandler, don't lose this.

377
00:19:29,717 --> 00:19:31,201
No--

378
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,199
Well, the turkey's burnt!

379
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,358
Potatoes are ruined! Potatoes

380
00:19:40,358 --> 00:19:42,406
are ruined! Potatoes are ruined!

381
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,216
Here we come

382
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,251
Walking down the--

383
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,448
This doesn't smell like Mom's.

384
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:56,310
It doesn't, does it? You wanted lumps?

385
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:59,262
Here you go, buddy. You got one!

386
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,945
Don't yell at me. You burned dinner!

387
00:20:01,945 --> 00:20:04,459
Hey, don't make her squeak again!

388
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,952
God, this is great! The plane is gone.

389
00:20:07,952 --> 00:20:10,534
I guess I'm stuck here with you guys.

390
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:13,272
We all had better plans.

391
00:20:13,272 --> 00:20:15,268
This was nobody's first choice!

392
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,877
Oh, really? So why was I busting

393
00:20:17,877 --> 00:20:20,374
my ass to make this delicious dinner?

394
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,015
You call that delicious?

395
00:20:22,015 --> 00:20:23,545
You be quiet!

396
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,257
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

397
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:31,262
Now this feels like Thanksgiving.

398
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:38,496
Skiing.

399
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:43,407
Shoop, shoop, shoop....

400
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,373
Shoop.

401
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:47,876
Eww.

402
00:20:47,876 --> 00:20:48,473
What?

403
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:50,896
Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey

404
00:20:50,896 --> 00:20:52,511
out of the oven.

405
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,999
Who cares?

406
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:56,580
He just sat in gravy.

407
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,416
Oh, my God! He's not alone.

408
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,892
Ugly Naked Guy is having Thanksgiving

409
00:21:04,892 --> 00:21:07,423
dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.

410
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,426
I gotta see this!

411
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,329
All right, Ugly Naked Guy!

412
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,368
Ugly naked dancing!

413
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,437
It's nice that he has someone.

414
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,356
Shall I carve?

415
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,488
By all means.

416
00:21:35,488 --> 00:21:36,483
All right.

417
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:43,831
Who wants light cheese,

418
00:21:43,831 --> 00:21:45,395
and who wants dark cheese?

419
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,438
I don't even want to know

420
00:21:47,438 --> 00:21:49,372
about the dark cheese.

421
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,890
Does anybody wanna split this?

422
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,306
I will.

423
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:53,941
You guys have to make a wish.

424
00:21:53,941 --> 00:21:55,505
Make a wish?

425
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,476
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.

426
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:04,388
You got the bigger half!

427
00:22:04,388 --> 00:22:06,322
What did you wish for?

428
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,416
The bigger half.

429
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:11,879
All right, I'd like

430
00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:13,329
to propose a toast.

431
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,526
A little toast here. Ding, ding!

432
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:17,365
This isn't the Thanksgiving

433
00:22:17,365 --> 00:22:21,233
you planned but for me,

434
00:22:21,233 --> 00:22:23,229
this has been really great.

435
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,311
I think because it didn't involve

436
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,280
divorce or projectile vomiting.

437
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,462
If you'd gone to Vail

438
00:22:32,462 --> 00:22:36,817
or if you had been with your family or if you didn't have syphilis

439
00:22:36,817 --> 00:22:43,284
and stuff...we wouldn't be together.

440
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,829
I guess what I'm trying

441
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:48,833
to say is that I'm very thankful that all

442
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:51,301
of your Thanksgivings sucked.

443
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,817
That's so sweet!

444
00:22:53,817 --> 00:22:55,364
Thank you.

445
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,906
Here's to a lousy Christmas!

446
00:22:58,906 --> 00:23:00,436
And a crappy New Year!

447
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:02,326
Hear, hear!

448
00:23:02,326 --> 00:23:03,406
Hear, hear!

449
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,486
All right! You guys,

450
00:23:44,486 --> 00:23:45,982
it's starting to snow.

451
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,973
And look, Ugly Naked Guy

452
00:23:48,973 --> 00:23:50,986
is hanging candy canes.

453
00:23:51,064 --> 00:23:52,861
Where?

454
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:56,062
Oh. Well.

455
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:58,094
That's festive.

456
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:02,438
Guys, there's somebody

457
00:24:02,438 --> 00:24:04,002
I'd like you to meet.

458
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,108
Wait, wait. What is that?

459
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:10,378
That's Marcel. Wanna say hi?

460
00:24:10,378 --> 00:24:11,874
No, I don't.

461
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:14,000
He's cute! Where'd you get him?

462
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,082
My friend Bethel saved him from a lab.

463
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:17,982
That is so cruel.

464
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:19,555
Why would a parent

465
00:24:19,555 --> 00:24:21,085
name their child Bethel?

466
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:27,093
That monkey's got a Ross on his ass.

467
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:33,422
Is he gonna live with you

468
00:24:33,422 --> 00:24:34,906
in your apartment?

469
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:36,475
Yeah. It's been kind of quiet

470
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,942
since Carol left.

471
00:24:38,045 --> 00:24:39,979
Why not get a roommate?

472
00:24:40,047 --> 00:24:42,561
You reach a certain age, having

473
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:45,075
a roommate is just kind of pathet--

474
00:24:48,055 --> 00:24:50,068
That's ''pathet.'' Sanskrit for

475
00:24:50,068 --> 00:24:52,081
''really cool way to live.''

476
00:25:41,942 --> 00:25:44,035
I'm doing new material tonight.

477
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:46,528
I have 1 2 songs about my mother's

478
00:25:46,528 --> 00:25:48,979
suicide and one about a snowman.

479
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:53,952
You might wanna open with the snowman.

480
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:56,017
Hi, Joey.

481
00:25:56,017 --> 00:25:57,046
Hey, buddy.

482
00:25:57,858 --> 00:25:59,854
So how'd it go?

483
00:25:59,854 --> 00:26:01,850
I didn't get the job.

484
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:04,380
How could you not?

485
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,864
You were Santa last year.

486
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,879
Some fat guy's sleeping

487
00:26:08,879 --> 00:26:10,858
with the store manager.

488
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:13,489
He's not even jolly.

489
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:14,973
It's all political.

490
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:16,538
What are you gonna be?

491
00:26:16,538 --> 00:26:18,068
One of his helpers.

492
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:20,375
It's just such a slap in the face,

493
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:21,871
you know?

494
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:23,462
Do you know what you're doing

495
00:26:23,462 --> 00:26:25,009
for New Year's?

496
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:27,569
Hey, what?

497
00:26:27,569 --> 00:26:29,019
What is wrong with New Year's?

498
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:31,489
You have Paolo. You don't have

499
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:35,928
to face the pressure of finding lips to kiss

500
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,862
when the ball drops!

501
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:39,864
Man, I'm talking loud!

502
00:26:41,034 --> 00:26:42,951
Paolo's gonna be in Rome

503
00:26:42,951 --> 00:26:44,868
this New Year's.

504
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:46,934
I'll be just as pathetic as you.

505
00:26:46,934 --> 00:26:48,930
Yeah, you wish.

506
00:26:50,877 --> 00:26:52,936
I've got an idea. Dinner.

507
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:54,997
It's perfect. We'll put it between

508
00:26:54,997 --> 00:26:56,948
lunch and breakfast.

509
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:00,483
I'm sick of being a victim

510
00:27:00,483 --> 00:27:02,081
of this Dick Clark holiday.

511
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:04,919
I say this year, we make a pact.

512
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:06,949
Just the six of us. Dinner.

513
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:07,539
Sure.

514
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:08,085
Fine.

515
00:27:08,895 --> 00:27:10,988
I was hoping for more enthusiasm.

516
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,013
Phoebe, you're on.

517
00:27:15,013 --> 00:27:16,059
Oh, good.

518
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,468
Hi. Ladies and gentlemen,

519
00:27:18,468 --> 00:27:22,899
back by popular demand Miss Phoebe Buffay.

520
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,104
Hi. Thanks. Hi.

521
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:31,066
I wanna start with a song

522
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,017
that means a lot to me.

523
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:41,817
I made a man with eyes of coal

524
00:27:41,928 --> 00:27:44,954
And a smile so bewitching

525
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:48,025
How was I supposed to know

526
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:51,065
That my mom was dead in the kitchen?

527
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:00,938
My mother's ashes

528
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:04,050
Even her eyelashes

529
00:28:04,885 --> 00:28:10,846
Are resting in a little yellow jar

530
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,994
And sometimes when it's freezing

531
00:28:16,897 --> 00:28:18,990
I feel a little sneezy

532
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,982
And now I-- Excuse me?

533
00:28:21,982 --> 00:28:24,064
Excuse me? Yeah, noisy boys.

534
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:27,957
Is it something you'd like

535
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:29,908
to share with the group?

536
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:33,104
No. No, that's okay.

537
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,347
If it's important enough

538
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:38,380
while I'm playing it's important enough

539
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,910
for everyone else.

540
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,853
That guy's going home with a note.

541
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:49,443
I was just saying--

542
00:28:49,443 --> 00:28:50,825
Speak up.

543
00:28:50,931 --> 00:28:51,920
Sorry, I--

544
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:54,981
I was saying you were the most

545
00:28:54,981 --> 00:28:57,029
beautiful woman I'd ever seen.

546
00:28:57,837 --> 00:29:01,487
And he said that Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman

547
00:29:01,487 --> 00:29:03,034
he'd ever seen.

548
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:04,991
I said I liked her in Splash,

549
00:29:04,991 --> 00:29:06,839
but not Wall Street.

550
00:29:06,947 --> 00:29:09,939
I thought she had a hard quality.

551
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:12,498
While Daryl is beautiful

552
00:29:12,498 --> 00:29:16,021
in a conventional way you are luminous

553
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:17,955
with a kind of delicate grace.

554
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,852
Then that's when you started yelling.

555
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:33,868
We're gonna take a short break.

556
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:39,407
That guy's going home

557
00:29:39,407 --> 00:29:40,903
with more than a note.

558
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,819
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.

559
00:29:51,858 --> 00:29:53,354
I can't believe he hasn't

560
00:29:53,354 --> 00:29:54,850
kissed you yet.

561
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:57,379
By my sixth date with Paolo,

562
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,830
he'd already named both my breasts.

563
00:30:02,936 --> 00:30:05,029
Did I just share too much?

564
00:30:06,873 --> 00:30:08,067
Just a smidge.

565
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:10,959
David's, like, a scientist guy.

566
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:12,876
He's very methodical.

567
00:30:12,946 --> 00:30:13,958
I think it's romantic.

568
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:14,970
Me too!

569
00:30:15,048 --> 00:30:16,965
Did you ever see

570
00:30:16,965 --> 00:30:18,882
An Officer and a Gentleman?

571
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:20,919
He's kind of like the guy

572
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,853
I went to see that with.

573
00:30:27,861 --> 00:30:29,874
Except he's smarter and gentler

574
00:30:29,874 --> 00:30:31,887
and sweeter.

575
00:30:32,098 --> 00:30:34,999
I just wanna be with him all the time.

576
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:36,966
You know, day and night.

577
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:38,831
And night and day.

578
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:41,806
And special occasions.

579
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,406
I see. You're gonna ask him

580
00:30:45,406 --> 00:30:46,902
to New Year's.

581
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:49,009
She's gonna break the pact.

582
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:51,005
No! No, no.

583
00:30:51,051 --> 00:30:53,815
No. Yeah, could I just--?

584
00:30:56,056 --> 00:30:57,540
Yeah. I already asked Janice.

585
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,024
What?

586
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:01,960
This was a pact! This was your pact!

587
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:03,478
I couldn't handle the pressure.

588
00:31:03,478 --> 00:31:04,928
I snapped!

589
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:06,498
But that was the worst breakup

590
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:07,965
in history!

591
00:31:08,068 --> 00:31:09,968
I'm not saying it was a good idea.

592
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,868
I snapped!

593
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:15,941
Hi, sorry I'm late.

594
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,050
Too many jokes.

595
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:28,978
Must mock Joey.

596
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:33,859
Nice shoes, huh?

597
00:31:34,861 --> 00:31:36,089
God, you're killing me!

598
00:31:38,031 --> 00:31:39,914
Ross, he's playing

599
00:31:39,914 --> 00:31:41,797
with my spatulas again!

600
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:44,352
He's not gonna hurt them, right?

601
00:31:44,352 --> 00:31:46,803
Do you always have to bring him?

602
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:50,375
I didn't wanna leave him alone.

603
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,843
We had our first fight this morning.

604
00:31:54,047 --> 00:31:56,931
It has to do with my working late.

605
00:31:56,931 --> 00:31:59,815
I said some things that I didn't mean.

606
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:03,919
He threw some feces.

607
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,456
If you're working late,

608
00:32:08,456 --> 00:32:09,952
I can look in on him.

609
00:32:10,063 --> 00:32:11,928
That would be great!

610
00:32:12,065 --> 00:32:14,016
But make sure it seems

611
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:15,967
like you're there to see him.

612
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:18,026
You're not doing it for me.

613
00:32:18,838 --> 00:32:20,334
Okay. But if he asks,

614
00:32:20,334 --> 00:32:21,830
I'm not going to lie.

615
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:29,463
But you can't actually

616
00:32:29,463 --> 00:32:30,879
test this theory.

617
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,946
Today's particle accelerators

618
00:32:32,946 --> 00:32:37,437
aren't powerful enough to simulate these conditions.

619
00:32:37,437 --> 00:32:39,786
I have a question then.

620
00:32:39,826 --> 00:32:40,923
Yeah?

621
00:32:40,923 --> 00:32:42,020
Do you plan on kissing me ever?

622
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:48,499
That's definitely a valid question,

623
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:54,906
and the answer would be yes. Yes, I was.

624
00:32:59,045 --> 00:33:00,928
But I wanted it to be

625
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:04,429
this phenomenal kiss at a phenomenal moment

626
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:05,942
because it's you.

627
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:07,008
Sure.

628
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,816
The longer I waited, the more

629
00:33:09,816 --> 00:33:11,812
phenomenal the kiss had to be.

630
00:33:11,858 --> 00:33:13,854
Now, it's just gotta be

631
00:33:13,854 --> 00:33:18,954
one of those things where I sweep everything off the table.

632
00:33:19,065 --> 00:33:20,515
And I'm not really

633
00:33:20,515 --> 00:33:21,965
a sweeping sort of fella.

634
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:24,064
David, I think you are

635
00:33:24,064 --> 00:33:26,060
a sweeping sort of fella.

636
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,887
I mean, you're a sweeper

637
00:33:28,887 --> 00:33:30,935
trapped inside a physicist's body.

638
00:33:31,945 --> 00:33:32,508
Really?

639
00:33:32,508 --> 00:33:33,071
I'm sure.

640
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:36,838
You should just do it. Just throw me.

641
00:33:39,953 --> 00:33:40,999
Now?

642
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:42,045
Yeah, right now. Just....

643
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:44,089
Okay. Okay. Okay.

644
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,510
You know what?

645
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:49,960
This is really expensive.

646
00:33:51,064 --> 00:33:52,998
And this was a gift.

647
00:33:54,067 --> 00:33:55,563
Now you're just tidying up.

648
00:33:55,563 --> 00:33:57,059
Okay.

649
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,370
You want me to throw you--?

650
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,866
I can hop.

651
00:34:20,994 --> 00:34:23,007
Tell me something, what does

652
00:34:23,007 --> 00:34:25,020
''no-date pact'' mean to you?

653
00:34:25,098 --> 00:34:27,049
It's just that Chandler

654
00:34:27,049 --> 00:34:29,000
and Phoebe have somebody.

655
00:34:29,102 --> 00:34:31,093
I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.

656
00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:32,166
Your ex-boyfriend?

657
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:33,195
Yeah.

658
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:36,037
You know more than one Fun Bobby?

659
00:34:36,037 --> 00:34:38,067
I happen to know a Fun Bob.

660
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,513
Okay. Here we go.

661
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:44,947
There's no room for milk.

662
00:34:50,056 --> 00:34:52,081
There. Now there is.

663
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:54,924
So on our no-date evening,

664
00:34:54,924 --> 00:34:56,989
three of you now have dates.

665
00:34:57,864 --> 00:34:58,910
Four.

666
00:34:58,910 --> 00:34:59,956
Five.

667
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,980
Sorry. Paolo's catching

668
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,060
an earlier flight.

669
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,417
And I met this really hot

670
00:35:05,417 --> 00:35:06,964
single mom at the store.

671
00:35:07,874 --> 00:35:09,068
What's an elf to do?

672
00:35:09,976 --> 00:35:12,024
So I'll be the only one alone

673
00:35:12,024 --> 00:35:14,072
when the ball drops?

674
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:16,894
We'll have a big party,

675
00:35:16,894 --> 00:35:18,907
and no one will know who's with who.

676
00:35:18,985 --> 00:35:20,981
I'll know. This is so not

677
00:35:20,981 --> 00:35:22,977
what I needed right now.

678
00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:24,488
What's the matter?

679
00:35:24,488 --> 00:35:25,887
Oh, it's Marcel.

680
00:35:28,094 --> 00:35:30,562
He's angry with me. I have

681
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:33,030
no idea why. He keeps shutting me out.

682
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:35,016
He's walking around all the time,

683
00:35:35,016 --> 00:35:36,933
dragging his hands.

684
00:35:37,837 --> 00:35:39,333
That's weird.

685
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:40,829
I had a blast with him.

686
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,935
Really?

687
00:35:41,935 --> 00:35:42,930
We played, watched TV.

688
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:45,842
That juggling thing is amazing.

689
00:35:48,848 --> 00:35:50,839
What juggling thing?

690
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,546
With the socks?

691
00:35:52,546 --> 00:35:54,042
I figured you taught him that.

692
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,045
No.

693
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,473
It wasn't that big a deal.

694
00:35:59,473 --> 00:36:01,856
Just socks. And a melon.

695
00:36:05,898 --> 00:36:06,978
Phoebe!

696
00:36:06,978 --> 00:36:08,058
Max. Do you know everybody?

697
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:10,968
No. Have you seen David?

698
00:36:11,871 --> 00:36:12,997
He hasn't been around.

699
00:36:13,106 --> 00:36:15,085
If you see him, tell him to pack.

700
00:36:15,085 --> 00:36:17,064
We are going to Minsk.

701
00:36:17,877 --> 00:36:18,940
Minsk?

702
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,003
Minsk. It's in Russia.

703
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:23,004
I know where Minsk is.

704
00:36:24,884 --> 00:36:26,499
We got the grant.

705
00:36:26,499 --> 00:36:28,114
Three years, all expenses paid.

706
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:30,468
And if you're gonna do Minsk,

707
00:36:30,468 --> 00:36:32,015
that's the way to go.

708
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:34,105
So when do you leave?

709
00:36:34,105 --> 00:36:35,185
January 1st.

710
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:45,549
Hello?

711
00:36:45,549 --> 00:36:48,029
What? Hey. Hi.

712
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:50,405
What are you doing here?

713
00:36:50,405 --> 00:36:51,969
Max told me about Minsk.

714
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:54,979
Congratulations! This is so exciting!

715
00:36:56,149 --> 00:36:57,616
It'd be even more exciting

716
00:36:57,616 --> 00:36:59,083
if we were going.

717
00:36:59,852 --> 00:37:02,047
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?

718
00:37:03,856 --> 00:37:07,439
Tell her. ''I don't wanna go to work with Lipson,

719
00:37:07,439 --> 00:37:08,986
Yamaguchi and Flank.

720
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,608
I wanna stay and make out

721
00:37:10,608 --> 00:37:12,155
with my girlfriend!''

722
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:15,060
Okay, thank you, Max. Thank you.

723
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:18,871
So you're really not going?

724
00:37:18,971 --> 00:37:20,467
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

725
00:37:20,467 --> 00:37:21,963
I just....

726
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:23,524
How can I leave you?

727
00:37:23,524 --> 00:37:24,974
I just found you.

728
00:37:25,011 --> 00:37:28,879
Oh, David. But what are you gonna do?

729
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:33,076
I don't know. You decide.

730
00:37:33,886 --> 00:37:35,001
Don't do that.

731
00:37:35,001 --> 00:37:36,116
But I'm asking you.

732
00:37:36,856 --> 00:37:38,437
I can't make a decision. Just--

733
00:37:38,437 --> 00:37:40,018
Okay. Stay.

734
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:43,375
Stay.

735
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:43,921
Stay.

736
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:54,031
Getting so good at that!

737
00:37:55,842 --> 00:37:57,867
It was Max's stuff.

738
00:38:05,852 --> 00:38:08,082
I love this artichoke thing.

739
00:38:08,855 --> 00:38:10,419
Don't tell me what's in it.

740
00:38:10,419 --> 00:38:11,983
The diet starts tomorrow.

741
00:38:16,863 --> 00:38:18,956
You remember Janice.

742
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:21,866
Vividly.

743
00:38:22,068 --> 00:38:24,019
How are you?

744
00:38:24,019 --> 00:38:25,970
I am fantastic.

745
00:38:26,005 --> 00:38:26,994
Now.

746
00:38:28,908 --> 00:38:30,506
It's amazing. We've been back

747
00:38:30,506 --> 00:38:34,044
together for what like 10 minutes, and--

748
00:38:34,044 --> 00:38:35,176
Is that all?

749
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:38,907
It's like we were never apart.

750
00:38:39,018 --> 00:38:40,918
Of course, we were, but--

751
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:42,818
Forgive and forget.

752
00:38:42,922 --> 00:38:45,015
Well, forget.

753
00:38:55,968 --> 00:38:56,514
Hi.

754
00:38:56,514 --> 00:38:57,060
Hi, I'm Sandy.

755
00:38:57,837 --> 00:38:59,930
Sandy, hi. Come on in.

756
00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:11,962
You brought your kids.

757
00:39:11,962 --> 00:39:13,975
Yeah. That's okay, right?

758
00:39:16,055 --> 00:39:18,455
Party!

759
00:39:18,455 --> 00:39:20,855
That thing is not coming in here!

760
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,053
This is how you greet guests?

761
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:25,928
If I showed up with my new girlfriend,

762
00:39:25,928 --> 00:39:27,993
she wouldn't be welcome?

763
00:39:28,901 --> 00:39:30,897
Your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate

764
00:39:30,897 --> 00:39:32,893
on my coffee table.

765
00:39:32,972 --> 00:39:34,519
He was more embarrassed

766
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:36,066
about that than anyone.

767
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:40,023
And for him to have the courage

768
00:39:40,023 --> 00:39:44,008
to walk back in here like nothing happened--

769
00:39:45,017 --> 00:39:46,530
All right. All right.

770
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:48,043
Just keep him away from me.

771
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:50,913
Thank you. Come on, Marcel.

772
00:39:51,123 --> 00:39:53,921
What do you say you and I mingle?

773
00:39:54,961 --> 00:39:57,009
All right, I'll catch up

774
00:39:57,009 --> 00:39:59,057
with you later.

775
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,350
Oh, my gosh!

776
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:09,830
Rachel, honey, are you okay?

777
00:40:09,942 --> 00:40:12,410
Where's Paolo?

778
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,878
Rome. Jerk missed his flight.

779
00:40:15,047 --> 00:40:17,072
And then your face exploded?

780
00:40:18,951 --> 00:40:19,975
No.

781
00:40:20,953 --> 00:40:22,904
Okay. I was at the airport

782
00:40:22,904 --> 00:40:27,425
getting into a cab when this woman, this blond

783
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:32,010
planet with a pocketbook starts yelling. Something

784
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:34,058
about how it was her cab first.

785
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,068
The next thing, she just

786
00:40:36,068 --> 00:40:38,036
starts pulling me out by my hair!

787
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:40,322
And I was blowing my attack

788
00:40:40,322 --> 00:40:44,001
whistle thingy and three more cabs show up.

789
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,909
So as I'm going to get into a cab,

790
00:40:46,909 --> 00:40:49,008
she tackles me!

791
00:40:49,815 --> 00:40:52,329
And I hit my head on the curb

792
00:40:52,329 --> 00:40:54,843
and cut my lip on my whistle.

793
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:00,917
Everybody having fun at the party?

794
00:41:02,962 --> 00:41:04,395
Are people eating my dip?

795
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:05,828
Yes.

796
00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:12,029
There.

797
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:14,951
That looks okay, right?

798
00:41:14,951 --> 00:41:16,964
You went a bit wide on the lipstick.

799
00:41:17,043 --> 00:41:18,459
Oh, I did?

800
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:19,875
Yeah.

801
00:41:19,945 --> 00:41:21,896
It's hard for me to tell.

802
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,847
My eye's closing up.

803
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:25,884
Let me get it for you.

804
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:27,515
Ow!

805
00:41:27,515 --> 00:41:28,044
Okay.

806
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:30,879
You know what? It looks fine.

807
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:33,888
Okay, here we go.

808
00:41:33,993 --> 00:41:35,961
Screw Paolo,

809
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:37,929
screw the psycho cab lady.

810
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,514
It's New Year's Eve.

811
00:41:39,514 --> 00:41:40,998
Let's have a good time.

812
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:41,983
Okay, here we go.

813
00:41:41,983 --> 00:41:42,933
Okay.

814
00:41:43,002 --> 00:41:45,994
All right, there you go. This way.

815
00:41:47,106 --> 00:41:48,937
Here you go.

816
00:41:52,044 --> 00:41:53,477
When I saw you at the store

817
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:57,880
last week it was the first time

818
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,945
I ever mentally undressed an elf.

819
00:42:02,054 --> 00:42:04,033
Wow, that's dirty.

820
00:42:04,033 --> 00:42:06,012
Yeah.

821
00:42:09,962 --> 00:42:11,122
Hey, kids.

822
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:14,949
He doesn't have to spend

823
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:18,870
the whole evening with me but at least check in.

824
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:21,973
There you are!

825
00:42:23,843 --> 00:42:26,038
You got away from me.

826
00:42:26,846 --> 00:42:28,842
But you found me.

827
00:42:28,842 --> 00:42:30,838
Here, Ross, take our picture.

828
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:34,044
Smile. You're on Janice Camera.

829
00:42:34,987 --> 00:42:36,818
IKill me. IKill me now.

830
00:42:41,827 --> 00:42:44,091
Hi, I'm Rachel.

831
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,923
So whose friend are you?

832
00:42:50,803 --> 00:42:53,931
Look at me, spilling everywhere.

833
00:42:55,908 --> 00:42:57,842
Everybody, it's Fun Bobby!

834
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:02,493
Hey, sorry I'm late.

835
00:43:02,493 --> 00:43:06,112
But my grandfather died about two hours ago.

836
00:43:06,852 --> 00:43:09,451
But I couldn't get a flight

837
00:43:09,451 --> 00:43:12,050
out till tomorrow, so here I am.

838
00:43:12,925 --> 00:43:15,490
Hey, Fun Bobby! How's it going, man?

839
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:18,055
Whoa! Who died?

840
00:43:22,835 --> 00:43:23,984
It's gonna be an open casket,

841
00:43:23,984 --> 00:43:25,133
you know?

842
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:29,137
So at least I'll get to see him again.

843
00:43:33,846 --> 00:43:36,940
Bobby? Fun Bobby?

844
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:40,043
Let me talk to you for just a sec.

845
00:43:40,886 --> 00:43:41,966
I recently lost

846
00:43:41,966 --> 00:43:44,622
a grandparent myself so I really know exactly

847
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:46,089
how you feel.

848
00:43:46,892 --> 00:43:48,376
But you're really bringing

849
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:49,860
the party down.

850
00:43:50,963 --> 00:43:52,009
I'm sorry.

851
00:43:52,009 --> 00:43:53,055
Yeah, yeah, okay.

852
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:56,157
There you go. There you go.

853
00:43:57,903 --> 00:44:00,383
I'm gonna blow this one up

854
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,863
and write ''Reunited'' in glitter.

855
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:04,909
All right, Janice, that's it!

856
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,877
Janice. Janice.

857
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,431
Hey, Janice, when I invited you,

858
00:44:10,431 --> 00:44:12,882
I didn't think it meant--

859
00:44:12,985 --> 00:44:15,010
Oh, no!

860
00:44:19,091 --> 00:44:21,889
I'm sorry you misunderstood.

861
00:44:21,994 --> 00:44:23,006
You listen to me!

862
00:44:23,006 --> 00:44:24,018
You listen to me!

863
00:44:24,129 --> 00:44:26,580
One of these times, it's just gonna be

864
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,031
your last chance with me!

865
00:44:31,036 --> 00:44:33,004
Will you give me the thing?

866
00:44:36,876 --> 00:44:37,922
Hi, Max.

867
00:44:37,922 --> 00:44:38,968
Yoko.

868
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:45,562
I've decided to go to Minsk

869
00:44:45,562 --> 00:44:47,075
without you.

870
00:44:48,854 --> 00:44:49,951
Wow.

871
00:44:49,951 --> 00:44:53,974
It won't be the same...but it will still be Minsk.

872
00:44:53,974 --> 00:44:55,891
Happy New Year.

873
00:44:57,096 --> 00:44:59,047
Are you all right?

874
00:44:59,047 --> 00:45:00,998
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

875
00:45:06,171 --> 00:45:07,968
Come on.

876
00:45:10,009 --> 00:45:12,039
You're going to Minsk.

877
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:14,069
No, I'm not going to Minsk.

878
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,074
You are so going to Minsk.

879
00:45:16,115 --> 00:45:18,094
You belong in Minsk.

880
00:45:18,094 --> 00:45:20,073
You can't stay here just for me.

881
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:23,081
If I go, I have to break up with you.

882
00:45:23,188 --> 00:45:24,655
And I can't break up with you.

883
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:26,122
Yes, you can.

884
00:45:26,926 --> 00:45:28,974
Just say, ''Phoebe, I love you,

885
00:45:28,974 --> 00:45:31,022
but my work is my life.

886
00:45:31,096 --> 00:45:32,996
That's what I have to do.''

887
00:45:33,098 --> 00:45:35,015
And I say, ''Your work?

888
00:45:35,015 --> 00:45:36,932
How can you say that?''

889
00:45:38,037 --> 00:45:40,551
Then you say, ''I have no choice.

890
00:45:40,551 --> 00:45:43,065
Can't you understand that?''

891
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:45,838
And I say, ''No! No!

892
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:47,834
I can't understand that!''

893
00:45:47,947 --> 00:45:48,510
Ow.

894
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:49,073
Sorry.

895
00:45:50,983 --> 00:45:52,467
And then you put

896
00:45:52,467 --> 00:45:53,951
your arms around me.

897
00:45:54,053 --> 00:45:55,953
Then you put your arms around me.

898
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:57,853
Oh, sorry.

899
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:00,524
And then you tell me you love me

900
00:46:00,524 --> 00:46:02,958
and you'll never forget me.

901
00:46:03,062 --> 00:46:05,087
I'll never forget you.

902
00:46:06,966 --> 00:46:12,382
Then you say that you have to go because you don't wanna start the

903
00:46:12,382 --> 00:46:14,862
year with me if you can't finish it.

904
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,578
I'm gonna miss you,

905
00:46:22,578 --> 00:46:24,176
you scientist guy.

906
00:46:26,986 --> 00:46:28,977
Hi, Dick Clark in Times Square.

907
00:46:29,088 --> 00:46:31,539
We're in a virtual snowstorm

908
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:33,990
of confetti here in Times Square.

909
00:46:34,093 --> 00:46:35,993
It gets better every....

910
00:46:36,095 --> 00:46:38,029
Here you go, kids.

911
00:46:38,831 --> 00:46:41,026
And then the peacock bit me.

912
00:46:42,034 --> 00:46:43,934
Please kiss me at midnight!

913
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:50,941
You seen Sandy?

914
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:54,958
I don't know how to tell you this but she's in the bedroom

915
00:46:54,958 --> 00:46:56,971
getting it on with Max.

916
00:46:57,049 --> 00:46:59,847
Oh, I did know how to tell you.

917
00:47:00,953 --> 00:47:02,517
Hey, everybody, the ball is dropping.

918
00:47:02,517 --> 00:47:04,081
What?

919
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:08,082
The ball is dropping!

920
00:47:09,962 --> 00:47:12,089
In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.

921
00:47:12,865 --> 00:47:15,060
And the moment of joy is upon us.

922
00:47:15,968 --> 00:47:17,435
Looks like that no-date pact

923
00:47:17,435 --> 00:47:18,902
worked out.

924
00:47:19,071 --> 00:47:20,487
Everybody looks so happy.

925
00:47:20,487 --> 00:47:21,903
I hate that!

926
00:47:21,974 --> 00:47:24,067
Not everybody is happy. Hey, Bobby!

927
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:30,014
--four, three, two one! Happy New Year!

928
00:47:32,084 --> 00:47:33,597
I thought I'd throw this out.

929
00:47:33,597 --> 00:47:38,389
I'm no math whiz but I do believe there are

930
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:40,857
three girls and three guys right here.

931
00:47:41,927 --> 00:47:43,394
I don't feel like kissing

932
00:47:43,394 --> 00:47:44,861
anyone tonight.

933
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:46,914
I can't kiss anyone.

934
00:47:46,914 --> 00:47:48,865
So, I'm kissing everyone?

935
00:47:49,835 --> 00:47:51,348
No, you can't kiss Ross.

936
00:47:51,348 --> 00:47:52,861
That's your brother.

937
00:47:52,938 --> 00:47:54,035
So now everybody's

938
00:47:54,035 --> 00:47:55,132
getting kissed but me.

939
00:47:55,874 --> 00:47:56,932
Somebody kiss me.

940
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:58,993
Somebody kiss me! It's midnight!

941
00:47:58,993 --> 00:48:00,944
Somebody kiss me!

942
00:48:01,046 --> 00:48:02,980
All right! All right!

943
00:48:03,882 --> 00:48:04,974
There!

944
00:48:11,857 --> 00:48:13,984
I wanted this to work so much.

945
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,860
I'm still in there.

946
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,391
Changing his diapers.

947
00:48:18,391 --> 00:48:19,887
Picking his fleas.

948
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:22,897
But he's just phoning it in.

949
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:27,384
It's hard that something you love

950
00:48:27,384 --> 00:48:29,898
so much doesn't love you back.

951
00:48:29,975 --> 00:48:33,001
I think that bitch cracked my tooth.

952
00:48:38,878 --> 00:48:40,328
Do you think they have

953
00:48:40,328 --> 00:48:41,778
yesterday's Daily News?

954
00:48:41,881 --> 00:48:43,764
I just wanna check my horoscope,

955
00:48:43,764 --> 00:48:45,647
see if it was right.

956
00:48:46,752 --> 00:48:48,350
Oh, my God! Don't look now.

957
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:52,719
Behind you there's a guy who can break our hearts

958
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:54,749
and plunge us into depression.

959
00:48:55,895 --> 00:48:57,795
Come to mama.

960
00:48:58,697 --> 00:48:59,777
He's coming.

961
00:48:59,777 --> 00:49:00,857
Be cool. Be cool. Be cool.

962
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,282
Nice hat.

963
00:49:02,282 --> 00:49:03,664
Thanks.

964
00:49:03,869 --> 00:49:05,319
We should do something. Whistle.

965
00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:06,769
I'm not whistling.

966
00:49:06,806 --> 00:49:07,795
Come on, do it!

967
00:49:07,873 --> 00:49:09,932
Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.

968
00:49:15,781 --> 00:49:17,874
I can't believe you did that.

969
00:50:05,798 --> 00:50:07,231
It's all my fault.

970
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:08,664
No, it's mine.

971
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,667
Why did I whoo-hoo?

972
00:50:10,703 --> 00:50:11,749
Was I hoping

973
00:50:11,749 --> 00:50:14,385
he'd turn around and say ''I love that sound.

974
00:50:14,385 --> 00:50:15,898
I must have you now''?

975
00:50:16,876 --> 00:50:18,326
I wish there was something

976
00:50:18,326 --> 00:50:19,776
we could do.

977
00:50:22,681 --> 00:50:23,705
Hello, coma guy.

978
00:50:25,684 --> 00:50:26,679
Get up, you Girl Scout!

979
00:50:26,679 --> 00:50:27,674
Up, up, up!

980
00:50:27,786 --> 00:50:28,810
What are you doing?

981
00:50:28,921 --> 00:50:30,889
Maybe nobody's tried this.

982
00:50:33,826 --> 00:50:35,919
I wish we at least knew his name.

983
00:50:36,695 --> 00:50:37,758
I hate that they're

984
00:50:37,758 --> 00:50:38,821
calling him John Doe.

985
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:40,848
It's so sad. It's like he's a deer,

986
00:50:40,848 --> 00:50:42,765
a female deer.

987
00:50:43,669 --> 00:50:45,728
Oh, I was gonna stop.

988
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,800
Look at that face.

989
00:50:48,941 --> 00:50:51,637
Even sleeping he looks smart.

990
00:50:51,744 --> 00:50:53,291
Yeah, but the dents in his knuckles

991
00:50:53,291 --> 00:50:54,838
mean he's artistic.

992
00:50:55,748 --> 00:50:57,744
Okay. He's a lawyer who teaches

993
00:50:57,744 --> 00:50:59,740
sculpting on the side.

994
00:50:59,852 --> 00:51:01,683
And he can dance.

995
00:51:02,655 --> 00:51:04,703
And he's the kind of guy who,

996
00:51:04,703 --> 00:51:10,290
when you're talking, he's listening not saying, ''I understand'' but really wondering

997
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:11,786
what you look like naked.

998
00:51:14,667 --> 00:51:16,862
I wish all guys could be like him.

999
00:51:18,771 --> 00:51:19,795
I know.

1000
00:51:24,877 --> 00:51:26,811
You don't even know this guy.

1001
00:51:26,912 --> 00:51:28,846
Are there no conscious men

1002
00:51:28,846 --> 00:51:30,780
in the city for you two?

1003
00:51:31,784 --> 00:51:32,876
He doesn't have anyone.

1004
00:51:32,985 --> 00:51:35,681
We feel kind of responsible.

1005
00:51:35,888 --> 00:51:38,652
I can't believe you said ''whoo-hoo.''

1006
00:51:38,857 --> 00:51:40,722
I don't even say ''whoo-hoo.''

1007
00:51:40,826 --> 00:51:42,657
Oh, she's coming up.

1008
00:51:42,728 --> 00:51:45,179
When we return, we'll talk with

1009
00:51:45,179 --> 00:51:47,630
the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.

1010
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:49,724
Put the kids to bed for this one.

1011
00:51:49,835 --> 00:51:51,752
Don't watch this. Weekend at Bernie's

1012
00:51:51,752 --> 00:51:53,669
is on Showtime and HBO.

1013
00:51:53,739 --> 00:51:54,728
No way.

1014
00:51:54,873 --> 00:51:56,824
She's your mom.

1015
00:51:56,824 --> 00:51:58,775
Exactly. Weekend at Bernie's.

1016
00:51:58,844 --> 00:52:00,795
Dead guy getting hit

1017
00:52:00,795 --> 00:52:02,746
in the groin 20, 30 times.

1018
00:52:03,849 --> 00:52:05,345
I gotta tell you,

1019
00:52:05,345 --> 00:52:06,841
I love your mom's books.

1020
00:52:07,653 --> 00:52:08,750
I can't get on a plane without one.

1021
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:09,847
This is so cool.

1022
00:52:10,656 --> 00:52:11,702
You wouldn't think so

1023
00:52:11,702 --> 00:52:15,258
if you were 1 1  and your friends were passing around

1024
00:52:15,258 --> 00:52:17,658
page 79 of Mistress Bitch.

1025
00:52:17,763 --> 00:52:19,890
I remember page 79.

1026
00:52:20,699 --> 00:52:22,747
The thing after the opera

1027
00:52:22,747 --> 00:52:24,795
with the girl with the trick hip?

1028
00:52:27,673 --> 00:52:28,685
I love your mom.

1029
00:52:28,685 --> 00:52:29,697
I think she's a blast.

1030
00:52:29,808 --> 00:52:31,776
That's because she's not your mom.

1031
00:52:31,877 --> 00:52:32,901
Oh, please. She's the--

1032
00:52:33,712 --> 00:52:34,974
Hi, sweetie.

1033
00:52:36,915 --> 00:52:39,816
When did ''Rigatoni'' get back from Rome?

1034
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,166
Last night.

1035
00:52:42,166 --> 00:52:42,712
Really?

1036
00:52:42,821 --> 00:52:44,334
So, his plane didn't explode

1037
00:52:44,334 --> 00:52:45,847
in a big ball of fire?

1038
00:52:46,659 --> 00:52:47,921
Just a dream I had.

1039
00:52:48,727 --> 00:52:49,716
But, phew!

1040
00:52:50,863 --> 00:52:52,626
Hey, she's on.

1041
00:52:55,668 --> 00:52:56,828
Nora Bing.

1042
00:52:58,737 --> 00:53:00,785
Back to the book. What is this

1043
00:53:00,785 --> 00:53:02,833
about you being arrested in London?

1044
00:53:03,676 --> 00:53:04,836
Your mom was arrested?

1045
00:53:04,943 --> 00:53:06,877
I'm busy beaming with pride.

1046
00:53:07,846 --> 00:53:12,362
This is kind of embarrassing...but occasionally, after

1047
00:53:12,362 --> 00:53:13,875
I've been intimate with a man...

1048
00:53:14,753 --> 00:53:16,846
Why would she say that's embarrassing?

1049
00:53:17,856 --> 00:53:19,369
...I just get this craving

1050
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:20,882
for kung pao chicken.

1051
00:53:21,694 --> 00:53:23,685
That's too much information.

1052
00:53:27,766 --> 00:53:31,759
Needless to say, he got a huge tip.

1053
00:53:34,707 --> 00:53:35,867
Oh, God, I love her!

1054
00:53:35,908 --> 00:53:38,638
I think I'm having a stroke.

1055
00:53:39,745 --> 00:53:42,646
So how is your book tour going?

1056
00:53:42,748 --> 00:53:44,744
Oh, fine. I'm leaving

1057
00:53:44,744 --> 00:53:46,740
for New York tomorrow, which I hate.

1058
00:53:46,852 --> 00:53:48,911
But I get to see my son, who I love.

1059
00:53:50,856 --> 00:53:52,807
This is the way that I find out.

1060
00:53:52,807 --> 00:53:54,758
Most moms use the phone.

1061
00:53:54,927 --> 00:53:56,895
Don't take this wrong, I just

1062
00:53:56,895 --> 00:53:58,863
don't see you as a mom.

1063
00:53:59,631 --> 00:54:01,280
-I don't mean that bad.

1064
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,929
-Oh, no. I'm a fabulous mom.

1065
00:54:03,836 --> 00:54:05,770
I bought my son his first condoms.

1066
00:54:11,844 --> 00:54:13,937
And then he burst into flames.

1067
00:54:22,855 --> 00:54:24,903
Let's see. Congress is debating

1068
00:54:24,903 --> 00:54:26,951
a new deficit-reduction bill.

1069
00:54:27,693 --> 00:54:30,173
The mayor wants to raise subway fares.

1070
00:54:30,173 --> 00:54:32,653
The high today was 45.

1071
00:54:33,665 --> 00:54:35,690
And teams played sports.

1072
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,657
What about Glen?

1073
00:55:03,829 --> 00:55:04,853
He could be a Glen.

1074
00:55:05,631 --> 00:55:06,859
Not special enough.

1075
00:55:07,766 --> 00:55:09,734
How about Agamemnon?

1076
00:55:09,935 --> 00:55:12,631
Way too special.

1077
00:55:20,646 --> 00:55:22,739
I'm famished. What do I want?

1078
00:55:22,848 --> 00:55:24,361
Please, God, don't let it be

1079
00:55:24,361 --> 00:55:25,874
kung pao chicken.

1080
00:55:26,685 --> 00:55:28,169
You watched the show.

1081
00:55:28,169 --> 00:55:29,653
What did you think?

1082
00:55:29,688 --> 00:55:30,785
I think you need to come out

1083
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:31,882
of your shell.

1084
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:36,760
What is this dive?

1085
00:55:36,862 --> 00:55:38,830
Only you could've picked this place.

1086
00:55:39,731 --> 00:55:41,261
Come on. Shut up. It's fun.

1087
00:55:41,261 --> 00:55:42,791
Give me a hug.

1088
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:45,233
I heard about the divorce.

1089
00:55:45,233 --> 00:55:46,831
Lesbian, huh?

1090
00:55:48,607 --> 00:55:51,104
Well, you know what they say:

1091
00:55:51,104 --> 00:55:53,601
Be careful what you wish for.

1092
00:55:55,714 --> 00:55:57,181
I think we're ready for some tequila.

1093
00:55:57,181 --> 00:55:58,648
I know I am.

1094
00:55:58,717 --> 00:55:59,712
Who's doing shots?

1095
00:55:59,712 --> 00:56:00,707
Hit me.

1096
00:56:00,752 --> 00:56:01,810
There you go. Ross?

1097
00:56:02,721 --> 00:56:03,767
I'm not really a shot-drinking

1098
00:56:03,767 --> 00:56:04,813
kind of guy.

1099
00:56:05,624 --> 00:56:06,818
Hi. Sorry we're late.

1100
00:56:06,859 --> 00:56:08,793
We kind of just, you know,

1101
00:56:08,793 --> 00:56:10,727
lost track of time.

1102
00:56:12,831 --> 00:56:14,765
But a man can change.

1103
00:56:20,739 --> 00:56:22,866
Anyone want me to appraise anything?

1104
00:56:33,852 --> 00:56:36,787
Well, I'm gonna go to tinker-town.

1105
00:56:36,855 --> 00:56:38,322
Mrs. Bing, I've read

1106
00:56:38,322 --> 00:56:39,789
everything you've written.

1107
00:56:40,592 --> 00:56:42,588
When I read Euphoria at Midnight,

1108
00:56:42,588 --> 00:56:44,584
I wanted to become a writer.

1109
00:56:44,696 --> 00:56:46,146
Oh, please.

1110
00:56:46,146 --> 00:56:47,596
If I can do it, anybody can.

1111
00:56:47,733 --> 00:56:48,728
Start with half a dozen

1112
00:56:48,728 --> 00:56:51,285
European cities throw in 30 euphemisms

1113
00:56:51,285 --> 00:56:55,637
for male genitalia and you've got yourself a book.

1114
00:56:56,742 --> 00:56:59,609
My mother, ladies and gentlemen.

1115
00:57:02,614 --> 00:57:05,606
Yeah, any messages for room 226?

1116
00:57:06,752 --> 00:57:08,282
You okay, slugger?

1117
00:57:08,282 --> 00:57:09,812
Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

1118
00:57:22,734 --> 00:57:24,634
What is with you tonight?

1119
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:26,865
Nothing. Nothing, nothing.

1120
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:29,636
Okay, thank you.

1121
00:57:32,678 --> 00:57:34,908
It's the Italian hand-licker, isn't it?

1122
00:57:35,747 --> 00:57:37,772
No. It's the one he's licking.

1123
00:57:38,817 --> 00:57:40,785
She's supposed to be with you.

1124
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,778
You're good.

1125
00:57:43,789 --> 00:57:46,240
I have sold 100 million copies

1126
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,691
of my books, and you know why?

1127
00:57:48,894 --> 00:57:50,361
The girl on the cover

1128
00:57:50,361 --> 00:57:51,828
with her nipples showing?

1129
00:57:53,832 --> 00:57:56,312
No, because I know how to write men

1130
00:57:56,312 --> 00:57:58,792
that women fall in love with.

1131
00:57:59,638 --> 00:58:01,606
I cannot sell a Paolo.

1132
00:58:01,707 --> 00:58:03,203
People will not turn 325 pages

1133
00:58:03,203 --> 00:58:04,699
for a Paolo.

1134
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:06,306
Come on. The guy's

1135
00:58:06,306 --> 00:58:07,802
a secondary character.

1136
00:58:08,613 --> 00:58:10,160
He's just a complication

1137
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,707
you eventually kill off.

1138
00:58:12,818 --> 00:58:13,842
When?

1139
00:58:16,621 --> 00:58:18,714
He's not a hero.

1140
00:58:19,624 --> 00:58:20,818
You know who our hero is?

1141
00:58:21,626 --> 00:58:22,689
The guy on the cover

1142
00:58:22,689 --> 00:58:23,752
with his nipples showing?

1143
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:25,822
No, it's you.

1144
00:58:26,631 --> 00:58:27,177
Please.

1145
00:58:27,177 --> 00:58:27,723
No, really.

1146
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:30,631
Come on. You're smart. You're sexy.

1147
00:58:30,836 --> 00:58:31,786
Right.

1148
00:58:31,786 --> 00:58:32,736
Yes, you are.

1149
00:58:32,838 --> 00:58:34,755
The fact that you don't think you are

1150
00:58:34,755 --> 00:58:36,672
makes you sexier.

1151
00:58:36,742 --> 00:58:38,738
Come on, kiddo.

1152
00:58:38,738 --> 00:58:40,734
You're gonna be fine, believe me.

1153
00:59:00,665 --> 00:59:01,962
I'll just pee in the street.

1154
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:12,699
Is Chandler here?

1155
00:59:12,911 --> 00:59:14,674
Wait. Come here.

1156
00:59:15,881 --> 00:59:21,719
Okay, about last night you know Chandler, you didn't tell....

1157
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:23,868
We don't need to tell Chandler.

1158
00:59:23,868 --> 00:59:25,916
It was just a kiss. No big deal, right?

1159
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:27,919
Right. No big deal.

1160
00:59:28,727 --> 00:59:29,887
In bizarro world.

1161
00:59:33,799 --> 00:59:34,788
You broke the code.

1162
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:36,333
What code?

1163
00:59:36,333 --> 00:59:37,766
You don't kiss your friend's mom.

1164
00:59:37,836 --> 00:59:39,787
Sisters are okay.

1165
00:59:39,787 --> 00:59:41,738
Maybe a hot-looking aunt.

1166
00:59:41,773 --> 00:59:43,934
But not a mom. Never a mom.

1167
00:59:46,878 --> 00:59:48,846
What are you guys doing out here?

1168
00:59:49,648 --> 00:59:51,212
Joey and I had discussed getting

1169
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:52,776
in an early morning racquetball game.

1170
00:59:54,653 --> 00:59:57,679
But apparently somebody overslept.

1171
00:59:59,658 --> 01:00:00,955
Well, you don't have your racquet.

1172
01:00:01,693 --> 01:00:02,790
No. No, I don't

1173
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:03,887
because it's being restrung.

1174
01:00:04,696 --> 01:00:06,755
Somebody was supposed to bring me one.

1175
01:00:07,799 --> 01:00:09,295
Well, you didn't call

1176
01:00:09,295 --> 01:00:10,791
and leave your grip size.

1177
01:00:12,904 --> 01:00:14,388
You guys are spending

1178
01:00:14,388 --> 01:00:15,872
way too much time together.

1179
01:00:18,877 --> 01:00:20,708
I'm scum. I'm scum.

1180
01:00:20,812 --> 01:00:21,858
How could you let this happen?

1181
01:00:21,858 --> 01:00:22,904
I don't know.

1182
01:00:23,715 --> 01:00:25,683
It's not like she's a regular mom.

1183
01:00:25,784 --> 01:00:27,684
She's sexy. She's....

1184
01:00:27,786 --> 01:00:29,811
You don't think my mom's sexy?

1185
01:00:30,922 --> 01:00:33,789
Well, not in the same way.

1186
01:00:33,892 --> 01:00:35,860
I'll have you know, Gloria Tribbiani

1187
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:37,828
was a handsome woman in her day.

1188
01:00:39,631 --> 01:00:41,178
You think it's easy giving birth

1189
01:00:41,178 --> 01:00:42,725
to seven children?

1190
01:00:44,736 --> 01:00:46,232
Okay, I think we're getting

1191
01:00:46,232 --> 01:00:47,728
into a weird area here.

1192
01:00:49,841 --> 01:00:51,638
What are you doing here?

1193
01:00:52,844 --> 01:00:54,744
Not playing racquetball.

1194
01:00:56,848 --> 01:00:58,844
He forgot to leave his grip size.

1195
01:00:58,844 --> 01:01:00,840
He didn't get the goggles.

1196
01:01:02,888 --> 01:01:05,686
Sounds like you two have issues.

1197
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:09,784
Goodbye, baby.

1198
01:01:11,963 --> 01:01:14,693
Do they wait for me to do this?

1199
01:01:20,772 --> 01:01:22,268
Are you gonna tell him?

1200
01:01:22,268 --> 01:01:23,764
Why would I tell him?

1201
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:26,673
If you don't, his mother might.

1202
01:01:27,779 --> 01:01:29,872
What are you guys doing here?

1203
01:01:30,782 --> 01:01:32,875
He's not even wearing a jock strap.

1204
01:01:38,657 --> 01:01:40,648
What did I ask?

1205
01:01:54,839 --> 01:01:56,670
What are you doing here?

1206
01:01:56,741 --> 01:01:58,254
Nothing. I just thought

1207
01:01:58,254 --> 01:02:01,641
I'd stop by, you know, after that I, you know.

1208
01:02:01,746 --> 01:02:03,646
So, what are you doing here?

1209
01:02:04,683 --> 01:02:06,651
I'm not really here.

1210
01:02:06,751 --> 01:02:08,799
I just thought I'd drop these off

1211
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:10,847
on the way. My way.

1212
01:02:13,692 --> 01:02:18,658
Do you come here a lot without me?

1213
01:02:18,763 --> 01:02:20,754
No, no, no.

1214
01:02:23,868 --> 01:02:25,768
Do you think he's doing any better

1215
01:02:25,768 --> 01:02:27,668
than he was this morning?

1216
01:02:28,873 --> 01:02:31,671
How would I know? I wasn't here.

1217
01:02:31,776 --> 01:02:33,323
Really? Not even

1218
01:02:33,323 --> 01:02:34,870
to change his pajamas?

1219
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:39,817
Oh, my God.

1220
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:41,716
You're my friend.

1221
01:02:41,716 --> 01:02:42,813
I had to tell you.

1222
01:02:43,622 --> 01:02:44,816
I can't believe it.

1223
01:02:45,824 --> 01:02:47,621
Paolo kissed my mom?

1224
01:02:48,727 --> 01:02:50,240
I don't know if you noticed,

1225
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:51,753
but he drank a lot.

1226
01:02:51,863 --> 01:02:54,730
I mean, you know how he gets--

1227
01:02:56,735 --> 01:02:58,669
I can't do this. I did it.

1228
01:02:58,770 --> 01:02:59,816
It was me. I'm sorry.

1229
01:02:59,816 --> 01:03:00,862
I kissed your mom.

1230
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:02,729
What?

1231
01:03:02,941 --> 01:03:05,392
I was upset about Rachel and

1232
01:03:05,392 --> 01:03:13,249
I had too much tequila, and Nora Mrs. Mom, your Bing, was...being nice.

1233
01:03:13,249 --> 01:03:14,648
But nothing happened.

1234
01:03:14,753 --> 01:03:15,742
Nothing. Ask Joey.

1235
01:03:15,887 --> 01:03:17,371
Joey came in--

1236
01:03:17,371 --> 01:03:18,855
You knew about this?

1237
01:03:19,658 --> 01:03:21,853
You know, knowledge is a tricky thing.

1238
01:03:22,794 --> 01:03:24,887
Why didn't you tell me?

1239
01:03:25,697 --> 01:03:27,295
You're lucky I caught them, or else

1240
01:03:27,295 --> 01:03:28,893
who knows what would've happened?

1241
01:03:29,701 --> 01:03:30,793
Thanks, man. Big help.

1242
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:33,761
What the hell were you thinking?

1243
01:03:33,872 --> 01:03:35,863
I wasn't. I don't know. I--

1244
01:03:35,907 --> 01:03:37,772
No one knows the crap I go through

1245
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:39,637
with my mom more than you.

1246
01:03:39,711 --> 01:03:40,723
I know.

1247
01:03:40,723 --> 01:03:41,735
I can't believe you did this.

1248
01:03:41,846 --> 01:03:43,228
Me neither.

1249
01:03:43,228 --> 01:03:44,610
I'm mad at you too.

1250
01:03:44,716 --> 01:03:46,166
Why are you mad at me--?

1251
01:03:46,166 --> 01:03:47,616
Let me slam the door.

1252
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,716
I didn't kiss her. See what happens

1253
01:03:50,716 --> 01:03:52,712
when you break the code?

1254
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:07,366
''A Woman Undone,

1255
01:04:07,366 --> 01:04:08,862
by Rachel Karen Greene.''

1256
01:04:09,641 --> 01:04:11,188
I thought I'd give it a shot.

1257
01:04:11,188 --> 01:04:12,735
I'm on the first chapter.

1258
01:04:12,844 --> 01:04:15,341
Do you think his ''love stick'' can be

1259
01:04:15,341 --> 01:04:17,838
''liberated from its denim prison''?

1260
01:04:19,751 --> 01:04:21,776
Yeah, I'd say so.

1261
01:04:21,953 --> 01:04:25,650
And there's no ''J'' in ''engorged.''

1262
01:04:30,795 --> 01:04:32,228
You going to the hospital tonight?

1263
01:04:32,228 --> 01:04:33,661
No. You?

1264
01:04:33,865 --> 01:04:34,889
No. You?

1265
01:04:37,736 --> 01:04:39,727
You just asked me.

1266
01:04:39,804 --> 01:04:41,795
Maybe it was a trick question.

1267
01:04:43,742 --> 01:04:45,835
Rachel, can we do this now?

1268
01:04:47,812 --> 01:04:49,803
I am so hot.

1269
01:04:51,716 --> 01:04:53,183
Here's my mom and dad

1270
01:04:53,183 --> 01:04:54,650
on their wedding day.

1271
01:04:54,753 --> 01:04:57,745
Now, you tell me she's not a knockout.

1272
01:04:59,624 --> 01:05:02,275
I can't believe this conversation.

1273
01:05:02,275 --> 01:05:04,926
Just try to picture her not pregnant.

1274
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:08,281
Central Perk is proud to present

1275
01:05:08,281 --> 01:05:10,732
Miss Phoebe Buffay.

1276
01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:12,737
Thanks.

1277
01:05:14,839 --> 01:05:17,290
I'd like to start with a song

1278
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:21,311
about a man I recently met who's come to be

1279
01:05:21,311 --> 01:05:22,778
very important to me.

1280
01:05:27,886 --> 01:05:29,837
You don't have to be awake

1281
01:05:29,837 --> 01:05:31,788
To be my man

1282
01:05:33,892 --> 01:05:36,343
Long as you have brain waves

1283
01:05:36,343 --> 01:05:38,794
I'll be there to hold your hand

1284
01:05:40,632 --> 01:05:42,657
Though we just met the other day

1285
01:05:42,801 --> 01:05:46,601
There's something I have got to say

1286
01:05:47,639 --> 01:05:49,123
Thank you very much.

1287
01:05:49,123 --> 01:05:50,607
I'm gonna take a short break.

1288
01:05:52,811 --> 01:05:56,611
That was Phoebe Buffay, everybody.

1289
01:05:57,682 --> 01:05:59,149
What the hell was that?

1290
01:05:59,149 --> 01:06:00,616
Phoebe just started--

1291
01:06:00,685 --> 01:06:02,715
I was talking to Joey.

1292
01:06:02,715 --> 01:06:04,745
All right, there, mother-kisser?

1293
01:06:09,694 --> 01:06:10,820
''Mother-kisser.''

1294
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:13,754
I'll shut up.

1295
01:06:13,865 --> 01:06:18,235
I know you're still mad at me but there were two people

1296
01:06:18,235 --> 01:06:19,702
there that night.

1297
01:06:19,871 --> 01:06:21,367
There were two sets of lips.

1298
01:06:21,367 --> 01:06:22,863
I expect this from her.

1299
01:06:23,741 --> 01:06:25,868
She's always been a Freudian nightmare.

1300
01:06:26,644 --> 01:06:29,670
Then why don't you say something?

1301
01:06:29,747 --> 01:06:31,231
Because it's complicated.

1302
01:06:31,231 --> 01:06:32,715
It's complex.

1303
01:06:32,851 --> 01:06:34,648
You kissed my mom.

1304
01:06:37,889 --> 01:06:40,585
We're rehearsing a Greek play.

1305
01:06:41,726 --> 01:06:42,693
That's funny.

1306
01:06:42,693 --> 01:06:43,660
Are we done now?

1307
01:06:43,728 --> 01:06:45,258
You mean you're not gonna

1308
01:06:45,258 --> 01:06:46,788
tell her how you feel?

1309
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:49,112
Just because you played

1310
01:06:49,112 --> 01:06:52,215
tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her.

1311
01:06:52,215 --> 01:06:53,728
You can't talk to her.

1312
01:06:53,838 --> 01:06:55,220
Okay. ''You can't''?

1313
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:56,602
Or you can't?

1314
01:06:57,742 --> 01:06:58,834
Okay, that's my finger.

1315
01:06:59,644 --> 01:07:01,805
Okay, that's my knee.

1316
01:07:02,614 --> 01:07:03,706
Still doing the play.

1317
01:07:12,624 --> 01:07:13,750
What did you do with him?

1318
01:07:17,862 --> 01:07:18,846
You're awake.

1319
01:07:18,846 --> 01:07:19,830
Look at you.

1320
01:07:20,632 --> 01:07:21,860
How do you feel?

1321
01:07:22,667 --> 01:07:24,658
A little woozy, but basically okay.

1322
01:07:24,736 --> 01:07:26,727
Gosh, you look good.

1323
01:07:26,771 --> 01:07:27,863
I feel good.

1324
01:07:29,674 --> 01:07:30,834
Who are you?

1325
01:07:30,875 --> 01:07:31,825
Sorry.

1326
01:07:31,825 --> 01:07:32,775
I'm Phoebe.

1327
01:07:32,844 --> 01:07:34,260
I'm Monica.

1328
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:35,676
I've been caring for you.

1329
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:36,747
We both have.

1330
01:07:36,881 --> 01:07:38,331
The Etch A Sketch is from you?

1331
01:07:38,331 --> 01:07:39,781
Actually, me.

1332
01:07:40,585 --> 01:07:41,682
I got you the foot massager.

1333
01:07:41,682 --> 01:07:42,779
I shaved you.

1334
01:07:42,887 --> 01:07:44,252
I read to you.

1335
01:07:44,252 --> 01:07:45,617
I sang.

1336
01:07:47,692 --> 01:07:48,784
Well, thanks.

1337
01:07:49,594 --> 01:07:50,640
Oh, my pleasure.

1338
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:51,686
You're welcome.

1339
01:07:51,729 --> 01:07:54,698
So I guess I'll see you around.

1340
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,700
What? That's it?

1341
01:07:58,603 --> 01:07:59,729
''See you around''?

1342
01:07:59,837 --> 01:08:01,333
What do you want me to say?

1343
01:08:01,333 --> 01:08:02,829
I don't know.

1344
01:08:03,641 --> 01:08:06,606
Maybe ''That was nice.''

1345
01:08:06,711 --> 01:08:07,803
''It meant something to me.''

1346
01:08:08,846 --> 01:08:10,711
''I'll call you.''

1347
01:08:11,749 --> 01:08:13,296
Okay. I'll call you.

1348
01:08:13,296 --> 01:08:14,843
I don't think you mean that.

1349
01:08:18,656 --> 01:08:20,624
This is so typical.

1350
01:08:20,758 --> 01:08:24,922
You know, we give and we give and we give.

1351
01:08:25,663 --> 01:08:27,722
And we just get nothing back.

1352
01:08:27,765 --> 01:08:29,744
And then one day, you wake up,

1353
01:08:29,744 --> 01:08:31,723
and it's, ''See you around.''

1354
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:35,635
Let's go, Phoebe.

1355
01:08:37,675 --> 01:08:39,222
You know what?

1356
01:08:39,222 --> 01:08:40,769
We thought you were different.

1357
01:08:40,845 --> 01:08:42,938
But I guess it was just the coma.

1358
01:08:53,758 --> 01:08:55,754
The car's waiting. I just wanted

1359
01:08:55,754 --> 01:08:57,750
to drop off my book for your friends.

1360
01:08:57,795 --> 01:08:59,746
Autographed.

1361
01:08:59,746 --> 01:09:01,697
And give you a goodbye kiss.

1362
01:09:01,799 --> 01:09:03,283
Here's the kiss,

1363
01:09:03,283 --> 01:09:04,767
here's the goodbye....

1364
01:09:04,902 --> 01:09:07,302
Anything you want from Lisbon?

1365
01:09:07,302 --> 01:09:09,702
Just knowing you're there is enough.

1366
01:09:09,874 --> 01:09:11,774
All right. Well, be good.

1367
01:09:11,774 --> 01:09:13,674
I love you.

1368
01:09:16,714 --> 01:09:18,807
You kissed my best Ross.

1369
01:09:20,885 --> 01:09:23,683
Or something to that effect.

1370
01:09:29,794 --> 01:09:31,728
Look, it was stupid.

1371
01:09:31,796 --> 01:09:32,808
Really stupid.

1372
01:09:32,808 --> 01:09:33,820
Really stupid.

1373
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,662
I don't even know how it happened.

1374
01:09:38,836 --> 01:09:41,253
I'm sorry, honey. I promise

1375
01:09:41,253 --> 01:09:43,670
it will never happen again.

1376
01:09:43,775 --> 01:09:45,675
Really, really stupid.

1377
01:09:45,777 --> 01:09:47,870
Really, really stupid.

1378
01:09:49,647 --> 01:09:50,710
Are we okay now?

1379
01:09:50,710 --> 01:09:51,773
Yeah.

1380
01:09:51,949 --> 01:09:53,644
No.

1381
01:09:58,756 --> 01:10:00,269
The forbidden love

1382
01:10:00,269 --> 01:10:01,782
of a man and his door.

1383
01:10:03,761 --> 01:10:05,308
He told her off. And not just

1384
01:10:05,308 --> 01:10:06,855
about the kiss.

1385
01:10:06,898 --> 01:10:07,887
You're kidding?

1386
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:10,247
He said, ''When are you gonna

1387
01:10:10,247 --> 01:10:11,794
start being a mom?''

1388
01:10:11,869 --> 01:10:12,893
Then she said:

1389
01:10:13,705 --> 01:10:15,753
''The question is, when are you gonna

1390
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:17,801
realize I have a bomb?''

1391
01:10:19,877 --> 01:10:21,811
Are you sure she didn't say:

1392
01:10:21,879 --> 01:10:24,347
''When are you gonna grow up

1393
01:10:24,347 --> 01:10:26,815
and realize I am your mom?''

1394
01:10:28,986 --> 01:10:30,436
That makes more sense.

1395
01:10:30,436 --> 01:10:31,886
You think?

1396
01:10:33,725 --> 01:10:34,817
What's going on now?

1397
01:10:35,727 --> 01:10:37,678
I don't know. I've been standing here

1398
01:10:37,678 --> 01:10:39,629
spelling it out for you.

1399
01:10:40,832 --> 01:10:42,732
I don't hear anything. Wait.

1400
01:10:42,834 --> 01:10:43,823
What do you see?

1401
01:10:44,635 --> 01:10:45,681
It's hard to tell.

1402
01:10:45,681 --> 01:10:46,727
They're tiny and upside down.

1403
01:10:46,838 --> 01:10:47,862
Wait, wait, wait.

1404
01:10:48,673 --> 01:10:50,169
They're walking away.

1405
01:10:50,169 --> 01:10:51,665
They're walking away.

1406
01:10:51,876 --> 01:10:53,810
No, they're not. They're coming

1407
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:55,744
right at us. Run!

1408
01:10:57,882 --> 01:10:59,315
Are you okay, kiddo?

1409
01:10:59,315 --> 01:11:00,748
Yeah, I'm okay.

1410
01:11:00,852 --> 01:11:02,752
All right. You be good.

1411
01:11:02,854 --> 01:11:04,685
Drive safe.

1412
01:11:06,691 --> 01:11:07,720
Mrs. Bing.

1413
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:08,749
Mr. Geller.

1414
01:11:17,769 --> 01:11:18,861
You mean that?

1415
01:11:19,804 --> 01:11:20,896
Yeah, why not?

1416
01:11:23,775 --> 01:11:25,766
So I told her.

1417
01:11:25,877 --> 01:11:26,844
How did it go?

1418
01:11:26,844 --> 01:11:27,811
Awful. Awful.

1419
01:11:27,979 --> 01:11:29,810
Couldn't have gone worse.

1420
01:11:30,882 --> 01:11:32,332
Well, how do you feel?

1421
01:11:32,332 --> 01:11:33,782
Pretty good.

1422
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:36,878
I told her.

1423
01:11:37,655 --> 01:11:38,849
Well, see?

1424
01:11:39,657 --> 01:11:41,687
So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea,

1425
01:11:41,687 --> 01:11:43,717
me kissing your mom, huh?

1426
01:11:43,828 --> 01:11:45,341
But we don't have to

1427
01:11:45,341 --> 01:11:46,854
go down that road.

1428
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:57,755
This is just the first chapter and I want your absolute

1429
01:11:57,755 --> 01:11:59,837
honest opinion. Okay?

1430
01:12:00,745 --> 01:12:02,741
And on page two, he's not reaching

1431
01:12:02,741 --> 01:12:04,737
for her ''heaving beasts.''

1432
01:12:06,651 --> 01:12:07,948
She could have heaving beasts.

1433
01:12:08,853 --> 01:12:11,845
Right, but in this case she doesn't.

1434
01:12:12,757 --> 01:12:13,746
What's a ''niffle''?

1435
01:12:13,858 --> 01:12:15,325
You can usually find them

1436
01:12:15,325 --> 01:12:16,792
on the heaving beasts.

1437
01:12:18,863 --> 01:12:20,888
Okay, so I'm not a great typist.

1438
01:12:21,699 --> 01:12:23,695
Did you get to the part

1439
01:12:23,695 --> 01:12:25,691
about his ''huge, throbbing pens''?

1440
01:12:25,903 --> 01:12:27,882
You don't wanna be around

1441
01:12:27,882 --> 01:12:29,861
when he starts writing with those.

1442
01:12:30,808 --> 01:12:32,799
That's it. Give them back.

1443
01:12:33,711 --> 01:12:35,776
Wait, I just got to the part

1444
01:12:35,776 --> 01:12:37,841
about her ''public hair.''

1445
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:41,170
No, no, we're done!

1446
01:14:29,357 --> 01:14:32,155
Aunt Silv, stop yelling!

1447
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:33,726
If you'd told me

1448
01:14:33,726 --> 01:14:36,325
vegetarian lasagna l would've made

1449
01:14:36,325 --> 01:14:37,388
vegetarian lasagna.

1450
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:40,830
The meat's only every third layer.

1451
01:14:40,830 --> 01:14:42,394
Maybe you could scrape.

1452
01:14:43,404 --> 01:14:44,871
Ross, did you really read

1453
01:14:44,871 --> 01:14:46,338
all these baby books?

1454
01:14:47,141 --> 01:14:49,137
You could plunk me down in

1455
01:14:49,137 --> 01:14:53,193
any woman's uterus, no compass and l could find my way

1456
01:14:53,193 --> 01:14:54,273
out like that!

1457
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:56,306
This is cool.

1458
01:14:57,118 --> 01:14:59,166
It says in some parts of the world

1459
01:14:59,166 --> 01:15:01,214
people eat the placenta.

1460
01:15:03,157 --> 01:15:05,216
And we're done with the yogurt.

1461
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:08,117
Sorry.

1462
01:15:08,329 --> 01:15:10,229
l did this as a favor.

1463
01:15:10,229 --> 01:15:12,129
l am not a caterer.

1464
01:15:12,233 --> 01:15:13,780
What do you want me to do

1465
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:15,327
with a dozen lasagnas?

1466
01:15:16,237 --> 01:15:18,330
Nice talk, Aunt Silv.

1467
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:20,303
You kiss Uncle Freddie

1468
01:15:20,303 --> 01:15:21,366
with that mouth?

1469
01:15:22,376 --> 01:15:24,873
Ross, listen. Do you know that right

1470
01:15:24,873 --> 01:15:27,370
now your baby is only this big?

1471
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:29,144
This is your baby.

1472
01:15:29,144 --> 01:15:30,139
''Hi, Daddy.''

1473
01:15:30,351 --> 01:15:31,340
Hello.

1474
01:15:32,186 --> 01:15:35,155
''How come you don't live with Mommy?''

1475
01:15:36,357 --> 01:15:37,853
''How come Mommy lives

1476
01:15:37,853 --> 01:15:39,349
with that other lady?''

1477
01:15:44,231 --> 01:15:46,222
''What's a lesbian?''

1478
01:15:51,238 --> 01:15:53,297
Honey, you can say it. Poconos.

1479
01:15:53,407 --> 01:15:58,208
Poconos. It's like ''poke a nose.''

1480
01:16:00,214 --> 01:16:03,206
Poke a nose.

1481
01:16:11,325 --> 01:16:12,741
So did l hear Poconos?

1482
01:16:12,741 --> 01:16:14,157
Yes.

1483
01:16:14,261 --> 01:16:15,791
My sister's giving us her place

1484
01:16:15,791 --> 01:16:17,321
for the weekend.

1485
01:16:18,132 --> 01:16:19,326
First weekend together.

1486
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:20,765
It's a big step.

1487
01:16:20,765 --> 01:16:22,164
l know.

1488
01:16:23,170 --> 01:16:25,218
It's just a weekend. Big deal.

1489
01:16:25,218 --> 01:16:27,266
Wasn't this supposed to be a fling?

1490
01:16:27,441 --> 01:16:31,276
Shouldn't it be flung by now?

1491
01:16:32,246 --> 01:16:34,237
We are way past a ''fling.''

1492
01:16:34,348 --> 01:16:36,344
I'm feeling things I've read about

1493
01:16:36,344 --> 01:16:38,340
in Danielle Steel books.

1494
01:16:38,452 --> 01:16:39,902
When I'm with him,

1495
01:16:39,902 --> 01:16:41,352
I'm just totally....

1496
01:16:42,123 --> 01:16:43,203
Nauseous.

1497
01:16:43,203 --> 01:16:44,283
I'm physically nauseous.

1498
01:16:45,326 --> 01:16:47,226
What am l supposed to do?

1499
01:16:47,226 --> 01:16:49,126
Call Immigration?

1500
01:16:50,131 --> 01:16:51,393
l could call Immigration.

1501
01:16:57,104 --> 01:16:58,196
What?

1502
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:00,690
Ugly Naked Guy is making

1503
01:17:00,690 --> 01:17:02,140
shadow puppets.

1504
01:17:04,111 --> 01:17:05,408
Look, it's Abraham Lincoln.

1505
01:17:07,248 --> 01:17:08,340
Oh, right!

1506
01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:11,311
Go. Go!

1507
01:17:17,124 --> 01:17:18,688
l love babies with

1508
01:17:18,688 --> 01:17:22,357
their little baby shoes and their little baby toes

1509
01:17:22,357 --> 01:17:24,353
and their little hands....

1510
01:17:25,132 --> 01:17:26,696
Okay, you're gonna have to stop that.

1511
01:17:26,696 --> 01:17:28,260
Forever.

1512
01:17:38,345 --> 01:17:40,142
Need a new table.

1513
01:17:40,381 --> 01:17:42,110
You think?

1514
01:17:49,223 --> 01:17:50,218
Come on in.

1515
01:17:50,218 --> 01:17:51,213
Hello.

1516
01:17:51,325 --> 01:17:55,227
l brought the books and Monica sends her love

1517
01:17:55,227 --> 01:17:57,127
along with this lasagna.

1518
01:17:57,198 --> 01:17:59,194
Great! ls it vegetarian?

1519
01:17:59,194 --> 01:18:01,190
Because Susan doesn't eat meat.

1520
01:18:03,237 --> 01:18:05,296
I'm pretty sure that it is.

1521
01:18:10,211 --> 01:18:12,162
Nineteen weeks, the breasts

1522
01:18:12,162 --> 01:18:14,113
are starting to swell.

1523
01:18:15,216 --> 01:18:17,241
According to the literature.

1524
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:19,269
l got the results of the amnio.

1525
01:18:19,269 --> 01:18:21,220
Tell me. ls everything...?

1526
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:23,318
Totally and completely healthy.

1527
01:18:23,318 --> 01:18:25,314
That is great!

1528
01:18:31,131 --> 01:18:32,228
When did you and Susan

1529
01:18:32,228 --> 01:18:33,325
meet Huey Lewis?

1530
01:18:34,134 --> 01:18:36,125
That's our friend Tanya.

1531
01:18:45,279 --> 01:18:48,077
Of course, it's your friend Tanya.

1532
01:18:50,184 --> 01:18:52,152
Don't you wanna know about the sex?

1533
01:18:52,152 --> 01:18:54,120
The sex?

1534
01:18:55,289 --> 01:18:57,689
I'm having enough trouble with

1535
01:18:57,689 --> 01:19:00,089
the image of you and Susan together.

1536
01:19:00,127 --> 01:19:02,186
But when you throw in Tanya....

1537
01:19:05,132 --> 01:19:07,225
The sex of the baby, Ross.

1538
01:19:09,303 --> 01:19:11,294
You know the sex of the baby?

1539
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:13,720
Want to know?

1540
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:14,300
No.

1541
01:19:15,109 --> 01:19:17,134
l don't want to. Absolutely not.

1542
01:19:17,211 --> 01:19:18,707
You shouldn't know until

1543
01:19:18,707 --> 01:19:22,248
you look down there and see, ''Oh, there it is.''

1544
01:19:23,150 --> 01:19:24,310
Or isn't.

1545
01:19:27,254 --> 01:19:28,300
Hello, Ross.

1546
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:29,346
Susan.

1547
01:19:30,157 --> 01:19:31,124
So?

1548
01:19:31,358 --> 01:19:33,121
So did you hear?

1549
01:19:33,227 --> 01:19:34,222
Yes, we did.

1550
01:19:34,222 --> 01:19:35,217
Everything's A-Okay.

1551
01:19:35,329 --> 01:19:38,127
Oh, that's so cool!

1552
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:40,325
It really is.

1553
01:19:41,168 --> 01:19:42,100
Do we know?

1554
01:19:42,269 --> 01:19:43,736
We certainly do.

1555
01:19:43,736 --> 01:19:45,203
It's going to be a--

1556
01:19:45,272 --> 01:19:46,261
Hello?

1557
01:19:46,373 --> 01:19:48,290
A guy who doesn't wanna know

1558
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:50,207
is standing here.

1559
01:19:51,312 --> 01:19:52,808
Well, is it what

1560
01:19:52,808 --> 01:19:54,304
we thought it would be?

1561
01:20:01,288 --> 01:20:03,119
What--?

1562
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:05,224
What did we think it'd be?

1563
01:20:06,193 --> 01:20:07,256
l don't wanna know.

1564
01:20:07,256 --> 01:20:08,319
Don't wanna know.

1565
01:20:09,129 --> 01:20:10,323
l should probably just go.

1566
01:20:11,198 --> 01:20:12,762
Well, thanks for the books.

1567
01:20:12,762 --> 01:20:14,326
No problem. Okay.

1568
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:19,129
Susan.

1569
01:20:24,311 --> 01:20:26,711
Who should we call first?

1570
01:20:26,711 --> 01:20:29,111
Your folks or Deb and Rhona?

1571
01:20:32,419 --> 01:20:34,148
Hello?

1572
01:20:36,223 --> 01:20:37,235
Never mind.

1573
01:20:37,235 --> 01:20:38,247
I don't wanna know.

1574
01:20:39,326 --> 01:20:41,209
Because it was my table,

1575
01:20:41,209 --> 01:20:43,092
l have to buy a new one?

1576
01:20:43,163 --> 01:20:45,131
That's the rule.

1577
01:20:45,131 --> 01:20:47,099
What rule? There's no rule.

1578
01:20:47,167 --> 01:20:48,731
You owe me a table.

1579
01:20:48,731 --> 01:20:50,295
How did you get there?

1580
01:20:51,071 --> 01:20:53,568
It was fine until your breakfast

1581
01:20:53,568 --> 01:20:56,065
adventure with Angela Delvecio.

1582
01:20:56,210 --> 01:20:58,075
You knew about that?

1583
01:20:58,178 --> 01:21:00,191
The impressions in the butter

1584
01:21:00,191 --> 01:21:02,204
left little to the imagination.

1585
01:21:03,183 --> 01:21:05,117
How about if we split it?

1586
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,616
What do you mean, buy it together?

1587
01:21:07,616 --> 01:21:09,112
Yeah.

1588
01:21:09,289 --> 01:21:11,302
Do you think we're ready for that?

1589
01:21:11,302 --> 01:21:13,315
Why not?

1590
01:21:14,094 --> 01:21:16,090
It's a big commitment.

1591
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:18,086
What if one of us wants to move out?

1592
01:21:18,132 --> 01:21:19,127
You're moving out?

1593
01:21:19,127 --> 01:21:20,122
I'm not.

1594
01:21:20,234 --> 01:21:21,280
You'd tell me if you were, right?

1595
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:22,326
Yes.

1596
01:21:23,103 --> 01:21:25,168
It's just, with my last roommate--

1597
01:21:25,168 --> 01:21:27,233
l know all about Kip.

1598
01:21:27,307 --> 01:21:29,804
We bought a hibachi, then he ran off

1599
01:21:29,804 --> 01:21:32,301
and got married. Things got ugly.

1600
01:21:33,113 --> 01:21:35,212
Let me ask you something.

1601
01:21:35,212 --> 01:21:37,311
Was Kip a better roommate than me?

1602
01:21:38,118 --> 01:21:39,346
Oh, don't do that.

1603
01:21:45,292 --> 01:21:48,056
There's changes in your schedule.

1604
01:21:48,095 --> 01:21:51,155
Your 4:00 herbal massage is at 4:0.

1605
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:52,694
And Miss Summerfield

1606
01:21:52,694 --> 01:21:54,190
canceled her 5:0 shiatsu.

1607
01:21:54,301 --> 01:21:55,290
Thanks.

1608
01:21:56,170 --> 01:21:58,070
Oh, here comes your :00.

1609
01:21:58,205 --> 01:22:00,156
l don't mean to sound unprofessional,

1610
01:22:00,156 --> 01:22:02,107
but-- Yum!

1611
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:09,172
Paolo! Hi! What are you doing here?

1612
01:22:11,185 --> 01:22:16,189
Rachella tell me you massage?

1613
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:19,115
Well, Rachella's right.

1614
01:22:24,097 --> 01:22:25,121
Oh, okay.

1615
01:22:25,232 --> 01:22:26,762
l don't know what you just said,

1616
01:22:26,762 --> 01:22:28,292
so let's start.

1617
01:22:30,204 --> 01:22:34,197
l am...being naked?

1618
01:22:34,341 --> 01:22:36,275
That's your decision.

1619
01:22:36,275 --> 01:22:38,209
Some people prefer to take off--

1620
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:41,305
Being naked!

1621
01:22:43,150 --> 01:22:45,146
l can't believe you don't

1622
01:22:45,146 --> 01:22:47,142
wanna know. l couldn't not know.

1623
01:22:47,221 --> 01:22:48,688
If the doctor knows,

1624
01:22:48,688 --> 01:22:50,155
Carol and Susan know--

1625
01:22:50,324 --> 01:22:52,121
And Monica knows.

1626
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:55,125
How? l don't even know.

1627
01:22:55,229 --> 01:22:56,776
Carol called to thank me

1628
01:22:56,776 --> 01:22:58,323
for the lasagna. She told me.

1629
01:22:59,132 --> 01:23:00,360
So what's it gonna be?

1630
01:23:04,137 --> 01:23:06,202
Oh, great! Now he knows.

1631
01:23:06,202 --> 01:23:08,267
I'm just excited about being an aunt.

1632
01:23:08,342 --> 01:23:11,175
Or an uncle.

1633
01:23:15,282 --> 01:23:16,311
Hey, Phoebe.

1634
01:23:16,311 --> 01:23:17,340
Hey, Pheebs.

1635
01:23:17,384 --> 01:23:18,373
Fine!

1636
01:23:22,155 --> 01:23:23,753
What's the matter?

1637
01:23:23,753 --> 01:23:25,351
Nothing. I'm just out of sorts.

1638
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:27,410
Well, you can use some of my sorts.

1639
01:23:27,410 --> 01:23:29,361
l rarely use them.

1640
01:23:30,163 --> 01:23:31,226
Can we get some cappuccino

1641
01:23:31,226 --> 01:23:32,289
over here?

1642
01:23:34,201 --> 01:23:35,361
Oh, right! That's me!

1643
01:23:37,271 --> 01:23:40,263
That table place closes at 7. Come on.

1644
01:23:40,374 --> 01:23:41,398
Fine.

1645
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:44,334
What is it?

1646
01:23:46,146 --> 01:23:48,125
All right. You know Paolo?

1647
01:23:48,125 --> 01:23:50,104
I'm familiar with his work.

1648
01:23:51,218 --> 01:23:53,118
He made a move on me.

1649
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:54,784
The store will be open tomorrow.

1650
01:23:54,784 --> 01:23:56,348
More coffee, please.

1651
01:23:58,325 --> 01:24:00,122
Well, what happened?

1652
01:24:00,227 --> 01:24:02,223
He came in for a massage,

1653
01:24:02,223 --> 01:24:04,219
and everything was fine until....

1654
01:24:08,335 --> 01:24:09,302
Oh, my God.

1655
01:24:09,302 --> 01:24:10,269
Are you sure?

1656
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:14,163
Oh, yeah. I'm sure.

1657
01:24:18,145 --> 01:24:20,141
And all of a sudden, his hands

1658
01:24:20,141 --> 01:24:22,137
weren't the problem anymore.

1659
01:24:26,253 --> 01:24:27,242
Was it...?

1660
01:24:27,354 --> 01:24:28,850
Boy Scouts could've camped

1661
01:24:28,850 --> 01:24:30,346
under there.

1662
01:24:34,294 --> 01:24:35,283
Wow.

1663
01:24:35,395 --> 01:24:37,329
What did you do?

1664
01:24:37,329 --> 01:24:39,263
l dealt with it like a professional.

1665
01:24:45,339 --> 01:24:47,204
''Ooh,'' what?

1666
01:24:47,307 --> 01:24:48,296
--ma Thurman.

1667
01:24:48,408 --> 01:24:49,756
The actress!

1668
01:24:49,756 --> 01:24:51,104
Uma Thurman!

1669
01:24:52,212 --> 01:24:53,201
Thanks, Rach.

1670
01:24:56,216 --> 01:24:57,262
What'll you do?

1671
01:24:57,262 --> 01:24:58,308
You have to tell her.

1672
01:24:58,352 --> 01:25:00,803
It's your moral obligation as a friend,

1673
01:25:00,803 --> 01:25:03,254
as a woman. It's a feminist issue.

1674
01:25:03,323 --> 01:25:04,312
Guys?

1675
01:25:05,125 --> 01:25:06,672
You have to.

1676
01:25:06,672 --> 01:25:08,219
Feminist issue? That's where l went.

1677
01:25:10,263 --> 01:25:11,747
She is gonna hate me!

1678
01:25:11,747 --> 01:25:13,231
Yeah, well....

1679
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:21,739
Will you pick one?

1680
01:25:21,739 --> 01:25:23,138
Just pick one.

1681
01:25:23,176 --> 01:25:25,172
Here, how about that one?

1682
01:25:25,172 --> 01:25:27,168
That's patio furniture.

1683
01:25:27,347 --> 01:25:29,764
So what? Like people will come in

1684
01:25:29,764 --> 01:25:32,181
and think, ''Oh, I'm outside again.''

1685
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:33,241
Fine.

1686
01:25:34,154 --> 01:25:35,280
What about the birds?

1687
01:25:36,456 --> 01:25:38,907
l don't know. They don't say,

1688
01:25:38,907 --> 01:25:41,358
''Hello, sit here. Eat something.''

1689
01:25:42,329 --> 01:25:43,825
You pick one.

1690
01:25:43,825 --> 01:25:45,321
Okay. How about the ladybugs?

1691
01:25:46,133 --> 01:25:48,163
Forget about the birds, but big red

1692
01:25:48,163 --> 01:25:50,193
insects suggest fine dining.

1693
01:25:50,303 --> 01:25:52,351
Fine! Want the birds? Get the birds!

1694
01:25:52,351 --> 01:25:54,399
Not like that, l won't.

1695
01:25:58,111 --> 01:26:00,204
Kip would have liked the birds.

1696
01:26:11,158 --> 01:26:12,153
Hi, Pheebs.

1697
01:26:12,153 --> 01:26:13,148
What's going on?

1698
01:26:13,226 --> 01:26:15,177
Are you moving out?

1699
01:26:15,177 --> 01:26:17,128
I'm getting ready for the weekend.

1700
01:26:18,331 --> 01:26:19,781
Are your weekends longer

1701
01:26:19,781 --> 01:26:21,231
than two days?

1702
01:26:22,169 --> 01:26:24,137
These aren't all my suitcases.

1703
01:26:24,237 --> 01:26:25,329
This one's Paolo's.

1704
01:26:29,176 --> 01:26:31,155
Rachel, can we talk for a sec?

1705
01:26:31,155 --> 01:26:33,134
Well, sure.

1706
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:35,341
Just for a sec, Paolo's on his way.

1707
01:26:48,095 --> 01:26:50,290
We haven't known each other that long.

1708
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:51,780
There are three things

1709
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:53,230
you should know:

1710
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:55,733
One, my friends are the most

1711
01:26:55,733 --> 01:26:58,133
important thing in my life.

1712
01:26:58,238 --> 01:27:00,206
Two, l never lie.

1713
01:27:01,141 --> 01:27:03,171
And three, l make the best

1714
01:27:03,171 --> 01:27:05,201
oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.

1715
01:27:07,314 --> 01:27:10,249
Okay. Thanks, Pheebs.

1716
01:27:15,322 --> 01:27:16,738
Oh, my God!

1717
01:27:16,738 --> 01:27:18,154
l know.

1718
01:27:18,258 --> 01:27:20,317
Why have l never tasted these?

1719
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,840
l don't make them a lot, because

1720
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:25,320
it's not fair to the other cookies.

1721
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:32,867
These are the best

1722
01:27:32,867 --> 01:27:34,363
oatmeal raisin cookies.

1723
01:27:35,175 --> 01:27:36,756
Which proves that l never lie.

1724
01:27:36,756 --> 01:27:38,337
l guess you don't.

1725
01:27:39,246 --> 01:27:41,339
Paolo made a pass at me.

1726
01:27:44,084 --> 01:27:45,176
What do you think?

1727
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:46,702
It's the most beautiful table

1728
01:27:46,702 --> 01:27:48,186
I've seen.

1729
01:27:48,288 --> 01:27:49,277
l know.

1730
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:51,187
Will you balance plates

1731
01:27:51,187 --> 01:27:52,284
on these heads?

1732
01:27:53,093 --> 01:27:54,190
Who cares? We'll eat at the sink.

1733
01:27:54,190 --> 01:27:55,287
Come on!

1734
01:27:58,098 --> 01:27:59,190
Heads up, Ross.

1735
01:27:59,299 --> 01:28:01,392
Score! You suck!

1736
01:28:05,138 --> 01:28:06,196
Are you okay?

1737
01:28:09,242 --> 01:28:10,334
l need some milk.

1738
01:28:12,312 --> 01:28:14,303
Okay. I've got milk.

1739
01:28:19,319 --> 01:28:21,116
Here you go.

1740
01:28:29,329 --> 01:28:31,126
Better?

1741
01:28:32,332 --> 01:28:33,356
No.

1742
01:28:36,236 --> 01:28:38,784
l feel so stupid! l think about

1743
01:28:38,784 --> 01:28:41,332
the other day with you guys.

1744
01:28:41,374 --> 01:28:43,274
And l was all, ''Oh, Paolo!

1745
01:28:43,274 --> 01:28:45,174
He's so great!

1746
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:47,178
He makes me feel so--''

1747
01:28:48,114 --> 01:28:49,172
God!

1748
01:28:50,083 --> 01:28:51,209
I'm so embarrassed!

1749
01:28:51,318 --> 01:28:53,183
I'm so embarrassed.

1750
01:28:53,286 --> 01:28:55,186
I'm the one he hit on.

1751
01:28:55,186 --> 01:28:57,086
l unleashed him on you.

1752
01:28:57,123 --> 01:28:59,091
If l had never met him--

1753
01:28:59,192 --> 01:29:00,187
I'm so sorry.

1754
01:29:00,187 --> 01:29:01,182
No, I'm sorry.

1755
01:29:01,294 --> 01:29:02,306
I'm sorry.

1756
01:29:02,306 --> 01:29:03,318
I'm sorry. Wait.

1757
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:05,210
What are we sorry about?

1758
01:29:05,210 --> 01:29:06,290
l don't know.

1759
01:29:06,399 --> 01:29:08,333
Right. He's the pig.

1760
01:29:09,135 --> 01:29:10,232
Such a pig!

1761
01:29:10,232 --> 01:29:11,329
Oh, God, he's such a pig!

1762
01:29:12,105 --> 01:29:15,233
He's like a big disgusting pig....

1763
01:29:15,342 --> 01:29:16,724
Pig man!

1764
01:29:16,724 --> 01:29:18,106
Yes, good!

1765
01:29:22,215 --> 01:29:25,207
But he was my pig man!

1766
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:28,310
How did l not see this?

1767
01:29:30,223 --> 01:29:31,247
Oh, l know!

1768
01:29:34,327 --> 01:29:38,126
Because he's gorgeous.

1769
01:29:38,231 --> 01:29:39,357
And he's charming.

1770
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:41,229
And when he looks--

1771
01:29:41,229 --> 01:29:42,292
Okay, Pheebs.

1772
01:29:43,069 --> 01:29:44,195
The end.

1773
01:29:47,073 --> 01:29:48,062
God.

1774
01:29:50,076 --> 01:29:52,067
Should l not have told you?

1775
01:29:52,312 --> 01:29:54,212
Trust me, it's much better

1776
01:29:54,212 --> 01:29:56,112
that l know.

1777
01:29:59,219 --> 01:30:01,198
But l just liked it better before.

1778
01:30:01,198 --> 01:30:03,177
It was better.

1779
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:22,119
She took it pretty well.

1780
01:30:22,119 --> 01:30:24,098
Paolo's over there now, so....

1781
01:30:24,244 --> 01:30:26,274
We should go and see if she's okay.

1782
01:30:26,274 --> 01:30:28,304
Just one second.

1783
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:31,196
Score!

1784
01:30:31,196 --> 01:30:32,242
Game! Nice!

1785
01:30:34,354 --> 01:30:36,117
Come on, Pheebs.

1786
01:30:37,324 --> 01:30:38,820
Well, it looks like we

1787
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:40,316
kicked your butts.

1788
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:42,709
She did. You could be on the Olympic

1789
01:30:42,709 --> 01:30:45,058
''Standing There'' team.

1790
01:30:45,098 --> 01:30:46,190
Come on. Two on one.

1791
01:30:46,299 --> 01:30:47,732
Why are you here?

1792
01:30:47,732 --> 01:30:49,165
She just broke up with him.

1793
01:30:49,269 --> 01:30:51,362
It's time for you to swoop in.

1794
01:30:52,272 --> 01:30:53,722
What, now?

1795
01:30:53,722 --> 01:30:55,172
Yes. Now is when you swoop.

1796
01:30:55,208 --> 01:30:57,187
When Paolo walks out,

1797
01:30:57,187 --> 01:30:59,166
you gotta be the first guy she sees.

1798
01:30:59,279 --> 01:31:01,730
She's gotta know you're everything

1799
01:31:01,730 --> 01:31:04,181
he's not. You're the anti-Paolo.

1800
01:31:06,119 --> 01:31:08,087
My Catholic friend is right.

1801
01:31:08,188 --> 01:31:09,251
She's distraught.

1802
01:31:09,251 --> 01:31:10,314
You're there for her.

1803
01:31:11,091 --> 01:31:13,707
You pick up the pieces and then

1804
01:31:13,707 --> 01:31:16,323
you usher in ''The Age of Ross.''

1805
01:31:23,303 --> 01:31:24,753
See this? See?

1806
01:31:24,753 --> 01:31:26,203
Hold it! Ascolta!

1807
01:31:29,309 --> 01:31:30,304
How's it going?

1808
01:31:30,304 --> 01:31:31,299
Don't stare.

1809
01:31:31,344 --> 01:31:33,824
She threw his clothes off the balcony.

1810
01:31:33,824 --> 01:31:36,304
Now there's gesturing and arm-waving.

1811
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:38,681
That is, ''How could you?''

1812
01:31:38,681 --> 01:31:40,245
or ''Enormous breasts!''

1813
01:31:42,255 --> 01:31:44,155
Here he comes.

1814
01:31:54,267 --> 01:31:58,100
l am to say goodbye.

1815
01:31:58,271 --> 01:32:00,102
Okay, bye-bye.

1816
01:32:03,276 --> 01:32:06,177
Paolo, l really hate you for what you

1817
01:32:06,177 --> 01:32:10,599
did, but l still have five of these so heat it at 75

1818
01:32:10,599 --> 01:32:12,083
until the cheese bubbles.

1819
01:32:16,322 --> 01:32:18,819
l just wanna tell you, and l think

1820
01:32:18,819 --> 01:32:21,316
I'd speak for everyone when l say....

1821
01:32:28,201 --> 01:32:30,135
Oh, just look at her.

1822
01:32:30,236 --> 01:32:31,316
Guys, l think only one of us

1823
01:32:31,316 --> 01:32:34,185
should go so she's not overwhelmed.

1824
01:32:34,185 --> 01:32:35,231
Right.

1825
01:32:35,308 --> 01:32:38,141
And l really think it should be me.

1826
01:32:55,128 --> 01:32:56,220
You all right?

1827
01:32:57,230 --> 01:32:59,164
I've been better.

1828
01:33:00,266 --> 01:33:02,234
l don't believe this.

1829
01:33:03,169 --> 01:33:04,665
l wasn't supposed to care

1830
01:33:04,665 --> 01:33:06,161
about this guy.

1831
01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:08,690
It was just supposed to be

1832
01:33:08,690 --> 01:33:11,141
this big, fun, ltalian thing.

1833
01:33:11,377 --> 01:33:13,857
Someday l could look back and say,

1834
01:33:13,857 --> 01:33:16,337
''That was a big, fun, ltalian thing.''

1835
01:33:18,184 --> 01:33:19,782
It wasn't supposed to feel

1836
01:33:19,782 --> 01:33:21,380
like this when it was over.

1837
01:33:24,257 --> 01:33:25,281
Come here.

1838
01:33:32,365 --> 01:33:35,763
Listen you deserve

1839
01:33:35,763 --> 01:33:37,259
so much better than him.

1840
01:33:37,370 --> 01:33:42,141
l mean, you should be with a guy who knows

1841
01:33:42,141 --> 01:33:44,109
what he has when he has you.

1842
01:33:47,347 --> 01:33:48,336
What?

1843
01:33:49,349 --> 01:33:52,250
I'm so sick of guys!

1844
01:33:53,219 --> 01:33:55,284
l don't want to look at

1845
01:33:55,284 --> 01:33:57,349
or think about another guy.

1846
01:33:58,158 --> 01:33:59,654
l don't even want

1847
01:33:59,654 --> 01:34:01,150
to be near another guy.

1848
01:34:08,168 --> 01:34:10,363
Ross, you're so great.

1849
01:34:22,248 --> 01:34:23,294
Are you all right?

1850
01:34:23,294 --> 01:34:24,340
Are you okay?

1851
01:34:25,151 --> 01:34:26,749
Medium. Any cookies left?

1852
01:34:26,749 --> 01:34:28,347
Yeah.

1853
01:34:31,391 --> 01:34:35,307
See, Rach l don't think swearing off guys

1854
01:34:35,307 --> 01:34:37,355
altogether is the answer.

1855
01:34:38,164 --> 01:34:40,177
What you need is to develop a more

1856
01:34:40,177 --> 01:34:42,190
sophisticated screening process.

1857
01:34:44,204 --> 01:34:45,301
l just need to be by myself

1858
01:34:45,301 --> 01:34:46,398
for a while.

1859
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:48,721
l just gotta figure out what l want.

1860
01:34:48,721 --> 01:34:50,302
No, no.

1861
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:53,279
See, because not all guys out there

1862
01:34:53,279 --> 01:34:55,247
are gonna be a Paolo.

1863
01:34:55,315 --> 01:34:57,306
No, l know. l know.

1864
01:34:57,350 --> 01:34:59,733
And I'm sure your little boy's

1865
01:34:59,733 --> 01:35:02,116
not gonna grow up to be one.

1866
01:35:03,122 --> 01:35:04,117
What?

1867
01:35:04,117 --> 01:35:05,112
What?

1868
01:35:07,327 --> 01:35:09,124
I'm having a boy?

1869
01:35:10,129 --> 01:35:11,255
No.

1870
01:35:12,232 --> 01:35:15,326
No. In fact, you're not having a boy.

1871
01:35:16,236 --> 01:35:18,136
I'm having a boy.

1872
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:21,290
Huh? Am l having a boy?

1873
01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:23,241
You're having a boy!

1874
01:35:23,376 --> 01:35:25,139
I'm having a boy!

1875
01:35:25,245 --> 01:35:26,240
I'm having a boy!

1876
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:27,235
What is it?

1877
01:35:27,347 --> 01:35:28,763
I'm having a boy!

1878
01:35:28,763 --> 01:35:30,179
I'm having a boy!

1879
01:35:34,153 --> 01:35:35,347
We already knew that!

1880

1881
01:35:48,334 --> 01:35:51,235
Yes! And that would be a shutdown!

1882
01:35:51,304 --> 01:35:52,328
Shutout!

01:36:00,675 --> 01:36:02,205
Yeah, get out!

1886
01:36:02,415 --> 01:36:03,882
You guys always hang out

1887
01:36:03,882 --> 01:36:05,349
in my apartment.

1888
01:36:06,152 --> 01:36:08,245
l'll only use my left hand.

1889
01:36:08,354 --> 01:36:10,322
Come on, wussies!

1890
01:36:14,327 --> 01:36:16,352
