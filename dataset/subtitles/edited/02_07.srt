1
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:03,931
Okay, what is it about me?

2
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:05,427
Do I not look fun?

3
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:07,854
Is there something

4
00:00:07,854 --> 00:00:09,469
repellent about me?

5
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:11,267
How was the party?

6
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,392
It couldn't have been worse.

7
00:00:13,392 --> 00:00:15,440
A woman literally passed through me.

8
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:17,477
Am I hideously unattractive?

9
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,801
No, you are not.

10
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:21,251
You are very attractive.

11
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,254
I do the same thing.

12
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:25,371
When I put on a little weight,

13
00:00:25,371 --> 00:00:27,453
I question everything.

14
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:33,261
I've put on weight?

15
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,357
Did you want to...?

16
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,917
No, not weight.

17
00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:40,464
More like insulation.

18
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,842
I'm unemployed,

19
00:00:43,842 --> 00:00:45,309
in need of a project.

20
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,441
Wanna work out?

21
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:47,504
I can remake you.

22
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,845
That might get in the way

23
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:51,409
of my lying-around time.

24
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:53,781
Please?

25
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:55,277
Come on, let her do it!

26
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,320
All right.

27
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:58,391
But if my boobs are bigger

28
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,359
than yours, I'm going home.

29
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,343
Your boobs are fine. I never

30
00:01:03,343 --> 00:01:05,459
should have said anything. Come here.

31
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:11,461
Can't make hands meet!

32
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,452
Let's do it!

33
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,423
What?

34
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,265
Just never seen your

35
00:02:18,265 --> 00:02:20,261
little stretchy pants before.

36
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,435
It's cute.

37
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,274
And we're changing.

38
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,451
Come on, give me five more!

39
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,462
Five more!

40
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:47,493
Five more and I'll flash you.

41
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:55,273
One...two...two and a half.

44
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,501
Just show me one of them.

45
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,860
She's insane.

46
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,259
The woman's insane.

47
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:19,428
Before work, after work,

48
00:03:19,428 --> 00:03:20,525
during work.

49
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:22,814
She's got me doing

50
00:03:22,814 --> 00:03:24,361
butt-clenches at my desk.

51
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:25,933
Now they won't

52
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:27,429
bring me my mail anymore.

53
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,365
Tell her to stop.

54
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:30,971
No, while she's unemployed

55
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:32,467
I'm all she's got.

56
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:34,861
Why don't we all pitch in

57
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:36,476
and buy her a restaurant?

58
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,452
How'd it go with Scott?

59
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:42,767
It was nice.

60
00:03:42,767 --> 00:03:46,348
Went to a romantic restaurant ordered champagne. Nice.

62
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,807
He still won't put out?

63
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:50,354
Nope. Zilch. Nothing.

64
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,457
Sorry, Pheebs.

65
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,929
I don't mind taking it slow.

66
00:03:54,929 --> 00:03:56,459
I like him a lot.

67
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,754
He's interesting,

68
00:03:58,754 --> 00:04:00,238
and he's really sweet.

69
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,240
Why won't he give it up?

70
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,856
Maybe he drives on

71
00:04:04,856 --> 00:04:06,403
the other side of the road.

72
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,210
If you know what I mean.

73
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:10,933
No. What do you mean?

74
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:12,417
He's not British.

75
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,321
Maybe he's gay.

76
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,450
I don't think that's it.

77
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:23,291
We went dancing

78
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,398
the other night and the way he held me

80
00:04:26,398 --> 00:04:31,235
and looked into my eyes I definitely felt something.

82
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,383
How much can you tell

83
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,429
from a look?

84
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:34,969
No, I felt it on my hip.

85
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:36,465
I could tell.

86
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:40,812
Yo, Bing!

87
00:04:40,812 --> 00:04:42,245
Racquetball in 20 minutes.

88
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:44,847
Joey, be a pal.

89
00:04:44,847 --> 00:04:46,445
Lift my hand and smack her with it.

90
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,921
Oh, Rachel! Don't look.

91
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:51,354
What?

92
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,940
I don't care.

93
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,487
I have a date tonight.

94
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,412
You have a date?

95
00:04:58,412 --> 00:04:59,561
Monica's setting me up.

96
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,424
What about Ross and....

97
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,295
My whole insane jealousy thing?

98
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:10,401
Well, as much fun as that was I've decided to opt for sanity.

100
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,505
You're okay about this?

101
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:14,275
Oh, yeah, come on!

102
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:15,304
I'm moving on.

103
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,366
He can press her up against

104
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:19,317
that window all he wants.

105
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,432
For all I care, he can throw her

106
00:05:21,432 --> 00:05:23,445
through the damn thing.

107
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,253
Hi, guys.

108
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,339
Monica, I'll come by

109
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:30,352
and pick up Fluffy's old cat toys.

110
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,323
Only if you say his full name.

111
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,318
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up

112
00:05:36,318 --> 00:05:39,270
Fluffy Meowington's cat toys?

113
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:40,471
All right.

114
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,253
You're getting a cat?

115
00:05:43,253 --> 00:05:45,232
Actually, we're getting a cat.

116
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,241
Together?

117
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,338
Both of you? Together?

118
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,316
It'll live with each of us

119
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:53,250
half the time.

120
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:56,355
Well, isn't that just lovely?

121
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,841
That's something you'll enjoy for a really,

123
00:06:00,841 --> 00:06:02,223
really long time.

124
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,195
Hopefully.

125
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,810
Look at that.

126
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,323
I gotta go! I got a date!

127
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,231
With a man.

128
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:16,431
You guys have a really good night and you two have a really good cat.

130
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,912
We're not supposed to take these

131
00:06:22,912 --> 00:06:24,510
when we leave.

132
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:32,853
Monica might've mentioned that this

133
00:06:32,853 --> 00:06:35,350
is my first date since my divorce.

134
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,323
If I seem a little nervous, I am.

135
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,426
How long do cats live?

136
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,953
I'm sorry?

137
00:06:44,953 --> 00:06:46,437
Cats. How long do they live?

138
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,855
Figuring you don't throw them

139
00:06:48,855 --> 00:06:50,470
under a bus, or something.

140
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,957
Maybe 1 5, 1 6 years.

141
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:56,437
Well, that's just great.

142
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,347
Cheers!

143
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,282
Right. Clink.

144
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:10,206
Monica told you I was cuter

145
00:07:10,206 --> 00:07:12,185
than this, didn't she?

146
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,323
No, Michael, it's not you.

147
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:18,336
Sorry. It's this thing.

148
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,457
It's not as bad as it sounds but my friend is getting a cat

150
00:07:22,457 --> 00:07:24,408
with his girlfriend.

151
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,345
Oh, that does sound....

152
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,208
He just started going out with her.

153
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,447
Is this guy an old boyfriend?

154
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,517
Yeah, he wishes.

155
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,263
I'm sorry. Look at me.

156
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,282
Michael, let's talk about you.

157
00:07:47,282 --> 00:07:49,233
All right.

158
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,235
Okay.

159
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,235
So....

160
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:56,854
Did you ever get a pet

161
00:07:56,854 --> 00:07:58,367
with a girlfriend?

162
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:00,861
So I figured it out.

163
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:02,277
What?

164
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:05,179
Why Scott won't sleep with me.

165
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,377
I'm not sexy enough.

166
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,479
Phoebe, that's crazy.

167
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,320
When I first met you,

168
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,417
know what I said?

169
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:16,218
I said, ''Excellent butt, great rack.''

170
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:22,233
Really? That's so sweet.

171
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:25,398
I mean, I'm officially offended.

172
00:08:25,398 --> 00:08:27,394
But that's so sweet.

173
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,406
If you wanna know what the deal is,

174
00:08:30,406 --> 00:08:32,471
you have to ask him.

175
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,214
You're right. You're right.

176
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,407
You are so yum!

177
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,238
I mean, it's a cat, you know?

178
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,206
It's a cat.

179
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,275
Why can't they get a bug?

180
00:09:04,275 --> 00:09:06,175
Those fruit flies.

181
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,242
Those things that live for a day.

182
00:09:08,242 --> 00:09:10,272
What are they called?

183
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,396
Fruit flies?

184
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:13,408
Yes!

185
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,278
Thank you.

186
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,272
Would you like dessert?

187
00:09:17,272 --> 00:09:19,223
No! No dessert.

188
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,385
Just the check. Please.

189
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:23,824
Oh, no.

190
00:09:23,824 --> 00:09:25,320
You're not having fun, are you?

191
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,229
No, no, I am.

192
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,268
But only because I've been playing

193
00:09:30,268 --> 00:09:33,203
the movie Diner in my head.

194
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:35,332
Oh, look at me.

195
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:36,499
Look at me.

196
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,841
I'm on a date

197
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:40,439
with a really great guy.

198
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,261
All I can think about is Ross,

199
00:09:43,261 --> 00:09:47,409
and his cat and his Julie.

201
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,221
Look, do you want a piece of pie?

202
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,315
No!

203
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,408
Too late for that, man.

204
00:09:56,408 --> 00:09:58,456
I've screwed this all up.

205
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,795
I just want to get over him.

206
00:10:00,795 --> 00:10:02,359
Why can't I do that?

207
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:06,349
I've been through a divorce.

208
00:10:06,349 --> 00:10:08,328
Trust me, you'll be fine.

209
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,275
You just haven't had any closure.

210
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,276
Closure!

211
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,442
That's it!

212
00:10:15,442 --> 00:10:16,437
That's what I need!

213
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,449
God, you're brilliant!

214
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,420
Why didn't I think of that?

215
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:24,354
How do I get that?

216
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:28,556
Well, there's no one way, really.

217
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,791
Whatever it takes

218
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,287
so that you can say to him:

219
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,389
''I'm over you.''

220
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,393
Over you.

221
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,402
That's what it is.

222
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,303
Closure.

223
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,367
Hello? Excuse me?

224
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,410
Excuse me. Hel--

225
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:47,892
Hang on.

226
00:10:47,892 --> 00:10:48,404
Excuse me?

227
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,431
What?

228
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:50,381
Hi. I'm sorry.

229
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,030
I need to borrow your phone

230
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,577
for one minute.

231
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,379
I'm talking.

232
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,873
One phone call, I'll be very quick.

233
00:10:58,873 --> 00:11:01,324
I'll even pay for it myself.

234
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,328
You're being a little weird

235
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:06,228
about your phone.

236
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,326
I'll call you back.

237
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,339
Thank you.

238
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,339
I'm so good with people.

239
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,246
Machine.

240
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:26,901
Just waiting for the beep.

241
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:28,351
Good.

242
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:32,482
Ross! Hi, it's Rachel.

243
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:37,512
I'm just calling to say that everything's fine,

245
00:11:37,512 --> 00:11:39,463
and I'm really happy for you.

246
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,267
And your cat.

247
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,431
Who, by the way, I think

248
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:46,461
you should name Michael.

249
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:55,405
See, I'm thinking of names so obviously I am over you.

251
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:58,506
I am over you.

252
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:01,786
And that, my friend,

253
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:04,254
is what they call ''closure.''

254
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:21,329
No, no, no no, no, no!

256
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:23,904
It's Sunday.

257
00:12:23,904 --> 00:12:25,434
I'm not running on a Sunday.

258
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,928
Why not?

259
00:12:26,928 --> 00:12:28,378
Because it's Sunday!

260
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,476
It's God's day.

261
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:35,444
If you say stop, then we stop.

262
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,277
Stop.

263
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,404
Come on, we can't stop!

264
00:12:39,404 --> 00:12:41,452
We got three more pounds to go!

265
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:43,394
I am the energy train

266
00:12:43,394 --> 00:12:45,294
and you are onboard!

267
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,438
Hey, Rach.

268
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,341
And how was the date?

269
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,353
I think there was a restaurant.

270
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,349
I know there was wine.

271
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,451
Well, actually, Julie's getting a cab.

272
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,742
I just need the cat toys.

273
00:13:18,742 --> 00:13:20,255
Did Monica say....

274
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,782
Why are you looking at me

275
00:13:21,782 --> 00:13:23,232
like that?

276
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,426
I'm sorry. I don't know, I....

277
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,350
I think I had a dream

278
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:31,341
about you but I don't remember.

280
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,472
Okay.

281
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,238
There they are.

282
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,474
Did you call me last night?

283
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:43,449
No. I stayed at Julie's last night.

284
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,324
I haven't been home yet.

285
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:48,292
Can I check my messages?

286
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,294
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

287
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,564
Rach, I got a message from you!

288
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,270
Who's Michael?

289
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,333
Oh, my God!

290
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:04,938
Hang up the phone.

291
00:14:04,938 --> 00:14:06,434
Give me the phone!

292
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,339
Give me the--

293
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,323
You're over me?

294
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,415
Oh, God!

295
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:22,222
You're--

296
00:14:22,222 --> 00:14:23,217
Oh, God.

297
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,263
You're over me?

298
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:35,331
When were you under me?

300
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,269
Rach.

301
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,244
Rachel, do you...?

302
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,382
I mean, were you?

303
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,314
What?

304
00:14:46,314 --> 00:14:47,377
Okay, okay.

305
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:53,257
Basically, lately, I've....

306
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,452
I've sort of had feelings for you.

307
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,326
You've had feelings for me?

308
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,429
So? You had feelings for me first!

309
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:11,892
You know about my--

310
00:15:11,892 --> 00:15:13,342
You know I had--

311
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,243
You know?

312
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,466
Chandler told me.

313
00:15:18,466 --> 00:15:20,417
When did he? When did he?

314
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,313
When you were in China.

315
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,325
Meeting Julie.

316
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,843
Julie. That's--

317
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:30,327
Oh, God!

318
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,262
I need to lie down.

319
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:36,914
No, I'm gonna stand.

320
00:15:36,914 --> 00:15:40,751
I'm gonna stand and I'm gonna walk.

322
00:15:40,751 --> 00:15:42,264
I'm walking and standing.

323
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:43,858
So you--

324
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:45,342
And now, now....

325
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,472
Now you're over me?

326
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:53,283
Are you over me?

327
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,194
That's Julie.

328
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,295
Hi, Julie.

329
00:16:07,295 --> 00:16:08,392
-I've got a cab waiting.

330
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,298
I'll be right down!

331
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,305
Wait, so you're going?

332
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,325
Well, I have to.

333
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:20,242
I can't deal with this right now.

334
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,342
I mean, I've got a cab.

335
00:16:22,342 --> 00:16:24,338
I've got a girlfriend.

336
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,214
I'm gonna go get a cat.

337
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:31,446
Cat!

338
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,435
Hey, Joey.

339
00:16:49,435 --> 00:16:50,430
Hey, Pheebs.

340
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,340
How come you're watching

341
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,336
a rabbi play electric guitar?

342
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:59,444
I can't find the remote.

343
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,379
Thank you.

344
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:06,805
Scott asked me to come over

345
00:17:06,805 --> 00:17:08,386
for lunch and I did.

346
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,388
And we did.

347
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,743
All right! Way to go!

348
00:17:12,743 --> 00:17:14,290
Yay, me!

349
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,196
So how did it happen?

350
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:20,238
I finally asked him what was going on.

351
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:21,329
What did he say?

352
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,375
He understands how sex can be

353
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,343
very emotional for a woman.

354
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,327
He was afraid

355
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:29,210
that I was going to get all:

356
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,829
''Will he call me the next day?

357
00:17:30,829 --> 00:17:32,410
Where is this going?''

358
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,352
He said he wanted to hold off

359
00:17:37,352 --> 00:17:39,417
until he was ready to be serious.

360
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:40,737
Wow.

361
00:17:40,737 --> 00:17:41,249
Yeah.

362
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:45,228
So I said, ''Okay. Relax, please.''

363
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,428
Sex can be just about two people

364
00:17:48,428 --> 00:17:50,424
in the moment.

365
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,465
If he wants to see me again,

366
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:54,461
he can call. If not, fine.

367
00:17:55,307 --> 00:18:02,472
So after a lot of talking I convinced him.

369
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,753
Let me get this straight.

370
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:11,221
He got you to beg to sleep with him.

371
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:13,274
He got you to say

372
00:18:13,274 --> 00:18:15,225
he never has to call you again.

373
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,245
And he got you thinking

374
00:18:17,245 --> 00:18:19,196
this is a great idea?

375
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,294
This man is my God!

376
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,345
Oh, this one's cute.

377
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,415
Yeah, and this one, and that one.

378
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,445
They're all cute. They're kittens.

379
00:18:39,445 --> 00:18:41,441
Just wrap one up.

380
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,371
You okay?

381
00:18:43,371 --> 00:18:44,321
Yeah, me?

382
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:47,325
Yeah, yeah. Yeah?

383
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,420
Ross, honey. Hey.

384
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,913
I know this is a big step,

385
00:18:52,913 --> 00:18:55,364
but I think we'll be okay.

386
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,329
Yeah, I know. I know.

387
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,804
So do you have any cats that are

388
00:19:01,804 --> 00:19:04,170
really old or incredibly sick?

389
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,178
I don't want one that's about to die.

390
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:11,193
We should've worked that out

391
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:13,172
before we came down here.

392
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,274
Okay, sweetie.

393
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:15,882
I'll narrow it down

394
00:19:15,882 --> 00:19:20,220
to this one here and this one with the stripes.

396
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,316
You pick.

397
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,224
Whoa, hey, I have to pick?

398
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,321
Yeah, whichever one you want.

399
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,391
Well, I don't know.

400
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:33,199
It's not that easy to choose.

401
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:41,335
Both cats are beautiful...and funny.

403
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:47,343
I'm sure I'd be happy with either cat.

404
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,800
Well, do you want to take both?

405
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,347
Both? Both!?

406
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:55,256
I can't have two cats!

407
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,295
Joey's the kind of guys

408
00:19:58,295 --> 00:20:00,229
who could have two cats.

409
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,533
Goodnight, Gunther.

410
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,810
Hi.

411
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,374
I didn't get a cat.

412
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,475
Oh, that's interesting.

413
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,250
No, it's not interesting.

414
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,246
It's very not interesting.

415
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,787
It's actually 100%

416
00:20:27,787 --> 00:20:29,283
the opposite of interesting.

417
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,453
I got it, Ross.

418
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,474
You had no right to tell me

419
00:20:32,474 --> 00:20:34,453
you had feelings for me.

420
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:37,400
I was doing great before I knew!

421
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,403
I was doing great too!

422
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:42,302
It's hard to see you with Julie.

423
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,365
You should've said so before!

424
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:46,023
I didn't know!

425
00:20:46,023 --> 00:20:47,570
How come you never said anything?

426
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:49,507
There wasn't a good time.

427
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,829
You had a year.

428
00:20:51,829 --> 00:20:53,376
And we only hung out every night!

429
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:57,512
Not every night.

431
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,340
It's not like I didn't try.

432
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,257
Things got in the way.

433
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,357
Like Italian guys,

434
00:21:04,357 --> 00:21:09,357
or ex-fiancés or Italian guys.

436
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,287
There was one Italian guy.

437
00:21:13,287 --> 00:21:15,238
Do you have a point?

438
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,758
The point is,

439
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:18,242
I don't need this now!

440
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,245
Okay? It's too late.

441
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,775
I'm with someone else.

442
00:21:21,775 --> 00:21:23,271
This ship has sailed!

443
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:24,861
You're gonna put away

444
00:21:24,861 --> 00:21:26,374
your feelings for me?

445
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,352
I've done it since ninth grade.

446
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,821
All right.

447
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:32,254
Go ahead and do that.

448
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,371
I don't need your ship!

449
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:34,451
Good!

450
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,791
And you know what?

451
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,287
Now I got closure!

452
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,381
Try the bottom one.

453
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,307
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.

454
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:05,832
We're not working out.

455
00:23:05,832 --> 00:23:07,248
It's over.

456
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:08,851
With one pound to go?

457
00:23:08,851 --> 00:23:10,250
Come on!

458
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:12,306
We're working, we're moving,

459
00:23:12,306 --> 00:23:14,257
we're grooving!

460
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,318
I don't mind the last pound.

461
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:20,263
In fact, I kind of like the last pound.

462
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:24,234
Don't make me do anything I'll regret.

463
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:27,437
What you gonna do, fat boy?

464
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,429
What?

465
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:33,843
Nothing. Except say it's wonderful

466
00:23:33,843 --> 00:23:36,243
how much energy you have.

467
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,246
Well, thanks.

468
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,914
Especially with how tough

469
00:23:39,914 --> 00:23:41,478
it's been to find work.

470
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,355
Well, you know....

471
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,823
You can't tell your parents you were

472
00:23:48,823 --> 00:23:51,388
fired, because they'd be disappointed.

473
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,916
It's not as if you have

474
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:58,367
a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.

475
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:00,396
Well, no, but I....

476
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,736
If it were me, I'd have difficulty

477
00:24:03,736 --> 00:24:06,233
getting out of bed at all.

478
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,411
You know, I try to stay positive.

479
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:19,313
So you feel like going for a run?

481
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,224
All right.

482
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:25,792
Because you don't have to.

483
00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:28,323
You could just take a nap right here.

484
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:31,425
Okay.

485
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,820
Just for a little while.

486
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,270
Okay.
