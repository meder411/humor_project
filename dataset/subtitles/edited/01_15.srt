1
00:00:03,247 --> 00:00:04,236
Coffee.

2
00:00:04,415 --> 00:00:05,427
Thank you.

3
00:00:05,427 --> 00:00:06,439
Cappuccino.

4
00:00:08,252 --> 00:00:11,221
And a nice, hot cider for Monica.

5
00:00:11,322 --> 00:00:13,222
Thank you.

6
00:00:13,358 --> 00:00:15,309
Rach, why does my cinnamon stick

7
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:17,260
have an eraser?

8
00:00:21,332 --> 00:00:22,458
That's why.

9
00:00:23,468 --> 00:00:25,265
Sorry.

10
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:23,318
Chandler?

11
00:01:24,362 --> 00:01:26,421
Miss Tedlock, you look lovely today.

12
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:28,795
That is a very flattering

13
00:01:28,795 --> 00:01:30,359
sleeve length on you.

14
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,366
Mr. Costilick would like you to stop

15
00:01:34,366 --> 00:01:36,362
by his office today.

16
00:01:37,341 --> 00:01:39,292
If it's about those prank memos,

17
00:01:39,292 --> 00:01:41,243
I wasn't involved.

18
00:01:41,345 --> 00:01:43,279
Nothing at all. Really.

19
00:01:45,483 --> 00:01:48,418
And frankly, those shenanigans have

20
00:01:48,418 --> 00:01:51,353
no place in an office environment.

21
00:01:57,395 --> 00:01:58,555
Hey, you guys!

22
00:01:59,297 --> 00:02:00,394
Chandler's coming and

23
00:02:00,394 --> 00:02:01,491
he has incredible news.

24
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,847
So when he gets here,

25
00:02:03,847 --> 00:02:05,394
let's all act, like, you know--

26
00:02:06,304 --> 00:02:07,771
Never mind. But it was gonna

27
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:09,238
be really good.

28
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:11,333
What's going on?

29
00:02:11,442 --> 00:02:16,909
So it's a typical day at work and Big AI tells me he wants

31
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:19,406
to make me processing supervisor.

32
00:02:20,218 --> 00:02:21,213
That is great!

33
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:22,208
Congratulations!

34
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,311
So I quit.

35
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:26,315
Why?

36
00:02:26,357 --> 00:02:28,416
Why? This was a temp job.

37
00:02:29,227 --> 00:02:30,324
Chandler, you've been there

38
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:31,421
for five years.

39
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,243
I know, but if I took it, I'd be

40
00:02:34,243 --> 00:02:36,256
admitting that this is what I do.

41
00:02:36,334 --> 00:02:38,831
Does that mean we have to start buying

42
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:41,328
our own toilet paper?

43
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:43,339
That was Joey Tribbiani

44
00:02:43,339 --> 00:02:45,239
with the big picture. Dan?

45
00:02:45,443 --> 00:02:47,240
Was it more money?

46
00:02:47,345 --> 00:02:49,410
Doesn't matter. I just don't want

47
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:54,241
to be a guy who sits in his office worrying about the WENUS.

49
00:02:56,454 --> 00:02:57,478
The ''WENUS''?

50
00:02:58,356 --> 00:03:00,273
Weekly estimated net usage system.

51
00:03:00,273 --> 00:03:02,190
It's a processing term.

52
00:03:02,426 --> 00:03:04,394
Oh, that WENUS.

53
00:03:06,297 --> 00:03:07,286
What will you do?

54
00:03:07,398 --> 00:03:09,798
I don't know. But I won't

55
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:12,198
figure it out working there.

56
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:14,295
I have something you can do!

57
00:03:14,405 --> 00:03:17,499
I have this new massage client, Steve.

58
00:03:18,342 --> 00:03:19,792
Anyway, he's opening up

59
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:23,439
a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.

61
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:27,884
Hi, there.

62
00:03:27,884 --> 00:03:29,351
Hi.

63
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,337
I know. You're a chef

64
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:33,254
and I thought of you first.

65
00:03:33,357 --> 00:03:35,291
But Chandler's the one

66
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:37,225
who needs a job right now, so....

67
00:03:38,429 --> 00:03:39,896
I just don't have a lot

68
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:41,363
of chef-ing experience.

69
00:03:41,465 --> 00:03:44,457
Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.

70
00:03:45,469 --> 00:03:47,437
What is he looking for?

71
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,264
He wants to do something eclectic.

72
00:03:50,341 --> 00:03:52,406
He's looking for someone

73
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:54,471
who can create the entire menu.

74
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:56,541
So, what do you think?

75
00:03:58,449 --> 00:03:59,962
Thanks. I just don't see myself

76
00:03:59,962 --> 00:04:01,475
in a big, white hat.

77
00:04:05,223 --> 00:04:07,384
Oh, Monica! Guess what?

78
00:04:10,194 --> 00:04:12,190
--a perfect run-up

79
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,186
and there he goes, a perfect....

80
00:04:14,298 --> 00:04:17,815
Watch stuff like this and you realize

82
00:04:17,815 --> 00:04:19,396
why evolution is just a theory.

83
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,307
Can you see my nipples

84
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,406
through this shirt?

85
00:04:28,446 --> 00:04:30,846
No, but don't worry.

86
00:04:30,846 --> 00:04:33,246
I'm sure they're still there.

87
00:04:33,317 --> 00:04:34,443
Where are you going?

88
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:38,217
I have an appointment with Dr. Robert

89
00:04:38,217 --> 00:04:41,215
Pilman, career counselor-a-go-go!

90
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:42,955
I added the ''a-go-go.''

91
00:04:42,955 --> 00:04:44,451
Career counselor?

92
00:04:45,263 --> 00:04:46,747
You guys all know

93
00:04:46,747 --> 00:04:48,231
what you want to do.

94
00:04:48,332 --> 00:04:49,356
I don't.

95
00:04:50,268 --> 00:04:51,866
You guys in the living room

96
00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:53,464
all know what you want to do.

97
00:04:54,238 --> 00:04:55,836
You have goals. You have dreams.

98
00:04:55,836 --> 00:04:57,434
I don't have a dream!

99
00:04:58,242 --> 00:04:59,755
The lesser-known

100
00:04:59,755 --> 00:05:01,268
''I Don't Have a Dream'' speech.

101
00:05:03,214 --> 00:05:05,409
I love my life! I love my life!

102
00:05:06,217 --> 00:05:07,411
''Brian's Song''!

103
00:05:10,388 --> 00:05:11,838
The meeting went great?

104
00:05:11,838 --> 00:05:13,288
So great!

105
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:14,887
He showed me

106
00:05:14,887 --> 00:05:16,383
where the restaurant's gonna be.

107
00:05:17,194 --> 00:05:18,707
It's not too big or too small.

108
00:05:18,707 --> 00:05:20,220
It's just right.

109
00:05:20,331 --> 00:05:22,327
Was it formerly owned

110
00:05:22,327 --> 00:05:24,323
by a blond woman and some bears?

111
00:05:24,402 --> 00:05:26,302
I'm cooking for him Monday,

112
00:05:26,302 --> 00:05:28,202
kind of an audition.

113
00:05:28,306 --> 00:05:30,757
Phoebe, he wants you here.

114
00:05:30,757 --> 00:05:33,208
It's great. You can make yummy noises.

115
00:05:33,244 --> 00:05:34,791
What are you gonna make?

116
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,338
Yummy noises.

117
00:05:37,415 --> 00:05:39,883
And Monica, what are you gonna make?

118
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:42,351
I don't know. It's gotta be great.

119
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,432
I know what you can make!

120
00:05:43,432 --> 00:05:44,444
I know!

121
00:05:45,256 --> 00:05:47,252
You should make that thing

122
00:05:47,252 --> 00:05:49,248
with the stuff.

123
00:05:49,427 --> 00:05:53,363
You know that thing with the stuff?

124
00:05:54,432 --> 00:05:56,423
Okay, I don't know.

125
00:05:57,468 --> 00:05:59,316
Anyone know a good date place

126
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:01,164
in the neighborhood?

127
00:06:01,205 --> 00:06:03,253
How about Tony's? If you finish

128
00:06:03,253 --> 00:06:05,301
a 32-ounce steak, it's free.

129
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,878
Anyone know a good place

130
00:06:10,878 --> 00:06:12,476
if you're not dating a puma?

131
00:06:14,218 --> 00:06:15,799
Who are you going out with?

132
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:17,380
Is this the bug lady?

133
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:20,316
''I love you, Ross.''

134
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:23,825
Her name is Celia and

135
00:06:23,825 --> 00:06:26,225
she's insect curator at the museum.

136
00:06:27,431 --> 00:06:29,365
What are you gonna do?

137
00:06:29,365 --> 00:06:33,802
Go out to dinner then bring her back to my place

139
00:06:33,802 --> 00:06:36,202
and introduce her to my monkey.

140
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:41,235
And he's not speaking metaphorically.

141
00:06:43,214 --> 00:06:45,813
So back to your place?

142
00:06:45,813 --> 00:06:48,412
You thinking maybe....

143
00:06:50,221 --> 00:06:52,416
Well, I don't know....

144
00:06:53,224 --> 00:06:55,317
I'm hoping....

145
00:06:56,227 --> 00:06:58,320
That monkey is a chick magnet.

146
00:06:58,362 --> 00:07:01,314
She'll take one look at his cute,

147
00:07:01,314 --> 00:07:04,266
little face and it'll seal the deal.

148
00:07:05,202 --> 00:07:07,198
Celia, don't worry.

149
00:07:07,198 --> 00:07:09,194
He's not gonna hurt you!

150
00:07:09,273 --> 00:07:11,264
Soothing tones.

151
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:14,188
Here, Marcel.

152
00:07:14,188 --> 00:07:16,167
I can't stand this.

153
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,248
He's got his claws on my--

154
00:07:18,248 --> 00:07:20,216
Yeah, all right.

155
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,192
Okay, try this salmon mousse.

156
00:07:31,395 --> 00:07:32,487
Good.

157
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,726
Is it better than

158
00:07:34,726 --> 00:07:36,222
the other salmon mousse?

159
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,268
It's creamier.

160
00:07:38,268 --> 00:07:40,236
Yeah? Well, is that better?

161
00:07:40,304 --> 00:07:42,300
I don't know.

162
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,296
We're talking about whipped fish.

163
00:07:44,442 --> 00:07:47,309
I'm just happy I'm keeping it down.

164
00:07:53,217 --> 00:07:54,411
God, what happened to you?

165
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:56,715
Eight and a half hours

166
00:07:56,715 --> 00:08:00,268
of aptitude tests intelligence tests, personality

168
00:08:00,268 --> 00:08:02,281
tests, and what do I learn?

169
00:08:03,194 --> 00:08:06,174
''You're suited for data processing for

170
00:08:06,174 --> 00:08:09,154
a large multinational corporation.''

171
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,781
That's so great!

172
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,362
You already know how to do that.

173
00:08:13,204 --> 00:08:15,172
Can you believe it?

174
00:08:15,206 --> 00:08:16,787
Don't I seem like I should

175
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,368
be doing something cool?

176
00:08:18,476 --> 00:08:20,444
I just always pictured myself

177
00:08:20,444 --> 00:08:22,412
doing something....

178
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,272
Something!

179
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:27,316
Chandler, I know, I know.

180
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:30,249
Hey, you can see your nipples

181
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:32,279
through this shirt.

182
00:08:35,326 --> 00:08:37,385
Maybe this will cheer you up.

183
00:08:38,395 --> 00:08:41,296
I had a grape about five hours ago,

184
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:44,197
so I better split this with you.

185
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:45,848
It's supposed to be small.

186
00:08:45,848 --> 00:08:47,395
It's a pre-appetizer.

187
00:08:47,438 --> 00:08:50,464
The French call it an amuse-bouche.

188
00:08:53,344 --> 00:08:56,404
Well, it is amusing.

189
00:09:03,387 --> 00:09:06,379
Hi, Wendy. Yeah, 8:00.

190
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:10,292
What did we say, $10 an hour?

191
00:09:10,394 --> 00:09:12,328
Okay, great.

192
00:09:12,328 --> 00:09:14,262
All right, I'll see you then.

193
00:09:14,298 --> 00:09:16,346
$10 an hour for what?

194
00:09:16,346 --> 00:09:18,394
A waitress from work is helping me.

195
00:09:19,303 --> 00:09:21,168
Waitressing?

196
00:09:24,275 --> 00:09:26,288
Of course I thought of you.

197
00:09:26,288 --> 00:09:28,301
But....

198
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:29,374
But....

199
00:09:29,374 --> 00:09:30,369
But, but....

200
00:09:32,316 --> 00:09:34,767
But it's just this night

201
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:37,218
has to go just perfect, you know?

202
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:39,317
Wendy's more

203
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:41,313
of a professional waitress.

204
00:09:43,494 --> 00:09:46,463
And I'm maintaining my amateur status

205
00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:49,432
so I can waitress in the Olympics.

206
00:09:52,336 --> 00:09:54,833
I don't mean to brag, but

207
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,330
I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76.

208
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,335
Took home a bronze.

209
00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:06,306
Amuse-bouche?

210
00:10:23,334 --> 00:10:25,325
Talk to me.

211
00:10:29,373 --> 00:10:30,903
A weird thing happened

212
00:10:30,903 --> 00:10:32,433
on the train this morning--

213
00:10:33,243 --> 00:10:35,438
Talk dirty.

214
00:10:39,249 --> 00:10:41,245
Here?

215
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:43,241
Come on. Come on.

216
00:10:43,354 --> 00:10:46,482
Say something hot.

217
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:51,352
What? What?

218
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:59,265
Vulva.

219
00:11:11,348 --> 00:11:13,316
Vulva?

220
00:11:14,418 --> 00:11:16,431
I panicked, all right?

221
00:11:16,431 --> 00:11:18,444
She took me by surprise.

222
00:11:19,256 --> 00:11:21,235
But it wasn't a total loss.

223
00:11:21,235 --> 00:11:23,214
We ended up cuddling.

224
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:26,423
You cuddled? How many times?

225
00:11:27,364 --> 00:11:29,423
Shut up. It was nice.

226
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:31,029
I don't think

227
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:32,525
I'm a dirty-talking kind of guy.

228
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,369
Just say what you wanna do to her.

229
00:11:35,369 --> 00:11:37,468
Or what you want her to do to you.

230
00:11:38,242 --> 00:11:39,789
Or what other people

231
00:11:39,789 --> 00:11:41,336
might be doing to each other.

232
00:11:41,445 --> 00:11:42,958
I'll tell you what.

233
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,471
Try something on me.

234
00:11:47,351 --> 00:11:49,251
Please be kidding.

235
00:11:51,388 --> 00:11:52,446
Why not?

236
00:11:53,257 --> 00:11:55,805
Just close your eyes and tell me

237
00:11:55,805 --> 00:11:58,353
what you'd like to be doing right now.

238
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:06,394
I'm in my apartment....

239
00:12:07,304 --> 00:12:08,350
Yeah, what else?

240
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,396
You're not there.

241
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,438
We're not having this conversation.

242
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:15,436
All right, I'll start. Ready?

243
00:12:16,346 --> 00:12:22,768
Oh, Ross...you get me so hot.

245
00:12:22,768 --> 00:12:25,219
I want your lips on me now.

246
00:12:29,426 --> 00:12:30,922
Now you say something.

247
00:12:30,922 --> 00:12:32,418
I really don't think so.

248
00:12:33,263 --> 00:12:35,345
You like this woman, right?

249
00:12:35,345 --> 00:12:37,427
You wanna see her again, right?

250
00:12:37,468 --> 00:12:39,868
If you can't talk dirty to me,

251
00:12:39,868 --> 00:12:42,268
how will you talk dirty to her?

252
00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:43,436
Now tell me

253
00:12:43,436 --> 00:12:44,533
you wanna caress my butt!

254
00:12:48,445 --> 00:12:51,243
Okay, turn around.

255
00:12:51,448 --> 00:12:54,246
I don't want you staring at me.

256
00:12:54,351 --> 00:12:55,414
All right, I'm not looking.

257
00:12:55,414 --> 00:12:56,477
Go ahead.

258
00:12:57,287 --> 00:12:58,447
Okay.

259
00:13:01,391 --> 00:13:02,904
I want--

260
00:13:02,904 --> 00:13:07,311
Okay, I want to feel your hot, soft skin

262
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:09,393
with my lips.

263
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,316
There you go.

264
00:13:12,316 --> 00:13:14,432
Keep going, keep going.

265
00:13:19,243 --> 00:13:22,235
I want to take my tongue and--

266
00:13:31,321 --> 00:13:32,447
Say it.

267
00:13:35,425 --> 00:13:37,416
Say it!

268
00:13:38,262 --> 00:13:45,428
--run it all over your body...until you're trembling with--

270
00:14:04,388 --> 00:14:06,379
With?

271
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:10,276
Funny story.

272
00:14:10,276 --> 00:14:12,227
You're not gonna believe this.

273
00:14:12,296 --> 00:14:14,309
I was always rooting for you

274
00:14:14,309 --> 00:14:16,322
two kids to get together.

275
00:14:18,435 --> 00:14:19,965
The trembling thing was nice.

276
00:14:19,965 --> 00:14:21,495
Shut up!

277
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:23,735
That guy from your old job

278
00:14:23,735 --> 00:14:25,231
called again.

279
00:14:25,442 --> 00:14:27,421
Again?

280
00:14:27,421 --> 00:14:29,400
And again and again and again.

281
00:14:34,418 --> 00:14:36,352
And again.

282
00:14:37,254 --> 00:14:39,284
Hey, Mr. Costilick.

283
00:14:39,284 --> 00:14:41,314
How's life on the 1 5th floor?

284
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,358
Yeah, I miss you too.

285
00:14:43,427 --> 00:14:45,844
It's a lot less satisfying

286
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:48,261
to steal pens from your own home.

287
00:14:49,466 --> 00:14:51,462
That's very generous.

288
00:14:51,462 --> 00:14:53,458
But this isn't about the money.

289
00:14:54,238 --> 00:14:56,303
I need more than a job.

290
00:14:56,303 --> 00:14:58,368
I need something I really care ab--

291
00:14:59,243 --> 00:15:01,473
That's on top of the year-end bonus?

292
00:15:02,212 --> 00:15:03,304
Your dream!

293
00:15:03,413 --> 00:15:05,313
Look, AI, I'm not

294
00:15:05,313 --> 00:15:07,213
playing hardball here, okay?

295
00:15:07,284 --> 00:15:09,280
This is not a negotiation.

296
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,276
This is a rejection!

297
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:14,186
Stop saying numbers!

298
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,838
I'm telling you,

299
00:15:15,838 --> 00:15:17,385
you've got the wrong guy!

300
00:15:18,195 --> 00:15:20,322
I'll see you Monday!

301
00:15:33,343 --> 00:15:35,925
Wow! It's huge!

302
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:38,507
It's so much bigger than the cubicle.

303
00:15:39,316 --> 00:15:41,307
This is a cube!

304
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:43,442
Look at this.

305
00:15:46,456 --> 00:15:49,448
You have a window!

306
00:15:50,227 --> 00:15:51,740
Yes, indeed-y.

307
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,253
With a beautiful view of--

308
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:56,332
Look! That guy's peeing!

309
00:15:57,334 --> 00:15:58,818
That's enough of the view.

310
00:15:58,818 --> 00:16:00,302
Check this out.

311
00:16:01,204 --> 00:16:03,172
Okay, sit down here.

312
00:16:03,273 --> 00:16:05,366
This is great.

313
00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:07,204
You ready?

314
00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:08,199
Yeah.

315
00:16:08,378 --> 00:16:10,403
Helen, could you come in here?

316
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,413
Thank you, Helen. That'll be all.

317
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:21,820
Last time I do that.

318
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,316
I promise.

319
00:16:27,397 --> 00:16:29,865
She doesn't seem very warm.

320
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:32,333
I know. She has no personality.

321
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,307
Wendy, don't do this to me.

322
00:16:39,409 --> 00:16:41,809
We had a deal.

323
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:44,209
Yeah, you promised.

324
00:16:50,454 --> 00:16:52,905
Who was that?

325
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:55,356
Wendy bailed.

326
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:58,360
I have no waitress.

327
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:01,342
That's too bad.

328
00:17:01,342 --> 00:17:03,355
Bye-bye.

329
00:17:04,267 --> 00:17:05,763
Ten dollars an hour!

330
00:17:05,763 --> 00:17:07,259
Twelve dollars an hour!

331
00:17:07,404 --> 00:17:09,821
I wish I could, but I've made plans

332
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:12,238
to walk around.

333
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:13,839
When you ran out on your wedding,

334
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,369
I was there.

335
00:17:15,412 --> 00:17:17,408
I put a roof over your head!

336
00:17:17,408 --> 00:17:19,404
If that means nothing....

337
00:17:20,317 --> 00:17:22,478
Twenty dollars an hour.

338
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:25,218
Done.

339
00:17:31,395 --> 00:17:33,391
Hello. Welcome to Monica's.

340
00:17:33,391 --> 00:17:35,387
May I take your coat?

341
00:17:38,435 --> 00:17:39,430
Hi, Steve.

342
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,425
Hello, Monica.

343
00:17:41,204 --> 00:17:43,263
Hello, greeter girl.

344
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,936
This is Rachel.

345
00:17:44,936 --> 00:17:46,432
Yeah, okay.

346
00:17:48,311 --> 00:17:50,336
Everything smells so delicious.

347
00:17:50,414 --> 00:17:52,814
I can't remember ever smelling

348
00:17:52,814 --> 00:17:55,214
such a delicious combination of--

349
00:17:55,252 --> 00:17:56,344
Okay, smells.

350
00:17:58,221 --> 00:18:00,234
It's a lovely apartment.

351
00:18:00,234 --> 00:18:02,247
Thank you. Would you like a tour?

352
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:03,872
I was just being polite,

353
00:18:03,872 --> 00:18:05,385
but all right.

354
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:09,815
What's up?

355
00:18:09,815 --> 00:18:14,166
In the cab on the way over Steve blazed up a doobie.

357
00:18:15,272 --> 00:18:16,364
What?

358
00:18:17,174 --> 00:18:19,222
Smoked a joint, you know?

359
00:18:19,222 --> 00:18:21,270
Lit a bone. Weed, hemp, ganja--

360
00:18:22,412 --> 00:18:24,380
I'm with you, Cheech.

361
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,850
Do you think he's gonna be cool?

362
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,284
Is it dry in here?

363
00:18:34,191 --> 00:18:36,182
Let me get you some wine.

364
00:18:36,293 --> 00:18:37,840
I think we're ready

365
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,387
for our first course too.

366
00:18:42,199 --> 00:18:44,298
These are rock shrimp ravioli

367
00:18:44,298 --> 00:18:56,312
in a cilantro ponzu sauce with just a touch of minced...ginger.

370
00:18:56,346 --> 00:19:00,180
Well, smack my ass and call me Judy!

371
00:19:03,153 --> 00:19:05,149
These are fantastic!

372
00:19:05,149 --> 00:19:07,145
Gosh! I'm so glad you liked them.

373
00:19:07,257 --> 00:19:10,351
Like them? I could eat 100 of them!

374
00:19:13,163 --> 00:19:16,812
That's all there is of these but in a few minutes,

376
00:19:16,812 --> 00:19:18,359
we'll serve some tartlets.

377
00:19:19,202 --> 00:19:20,396
''Tartlets''?

378
00:19:21,171 --> 00:19:22,365
''Tartlets.''

379
00:19:23,306 --> 00:19:25,274
''Tartlets.''

380
00:19:27,177 --> 00:19:29,168
Word has lost all meaning.

381
00:19:35,318 --> 00:19:36,802
Excuse me.

382
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:38,286
Can I help you with anything?

383
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:40,272
You know, I don't know

384
00:19:40,272 --> 00:19:42,223
what I'm looking for.

385
00:19:57,307 --> 00:19:59,332
Cool! Taco shells!

386
00:20:01,411 --> 00:20:03,311
They're like a little

387
00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:05,211
corn envelope, you know?

388
00:20:05,315 --> 00:20:07,783
You don't wanna spoil your appetite.

389
00:20:07,783 --> 00:20:10,251
Hey, Sugar-O's!

390
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,867
You know, if you just wait

391
00:20:11,867 --> 00:20:13,414
another 6 1 /2 minutes--

392
00:20:14,224 --> 00:20:15,822
Macaroni and cheese!

393
00:20:15,822 --> 00:20:17,420
We gotta make this!

394
00:20:21,431 --> 00:20:23,399
No, we don't.

395
00:20:23,399 --> 00:20:25,367
Oh, okay.

396
00:20:26,336 --> 00:20:28,236
Sorry.

397
00:20:32,242 --> 00:20:34,437
Why don't you just have a seat here?

398
00:20:40,283 --> 00:20:41,915
Give me the gummy bears.

399
00:20:41,915 --> 00:20:43,547
No.

400
00:20:45,555 --> 00:20:46,903
Give them to me.

401
00:20:46,903 --> 00:20:48,251
We'll share.

402
00:20:48,358 --> 00:20:49,905
No. Give me the bears.

403
00:20:49,905 --> 00:20:51,452
You can't have any.

404
00:20:52,262 --> 00:20:54,253
It's not worth it!

405
00:20:54,364 --> 00:20:57,299
Bears overboard! They're drowning!

406
00:20:58,468 --> 00:21:00,385
Don't just stand there.

407
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,302
Call 9-1
-1 .

408
00:21:02,405 --> 00:21:04,322
Hey, fellas, grab onto a Sugar-O!

409
00:21:04,322 --> 00:21:06,239
Save yourselves!

410
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:11,303
Help! Help, I'm drowning!

411
00:21:11,448 --> 00:21:13,382
That's it! Dinner is over!

412
00:21:13,382 --> 00:21:15,316
What! Why?

413
00:21:15,418 --> 00:21:17,869
Why? What if I came into your office

414
00:21:17,869 --> 00:21:20,320
and I started...?

415
00:21:20,423 --> 00:21:22,357
I can't think of an example.

416
00:21:22,425 --> 00:21:24,342
I've waited seven years

417
00:21:24,342 --> 00:21:28,297
for an opportunity like this and you can't wait 4 1 /2 minutes

419
00:21:28,297 --> 00:21:30,231
for a tartlet?

420
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:39,908
So I told him,

421
00:21:39,908 --> 00:21:41,375
''I'm sorry. That's how I feel.''

422
00:21:41,444 --> 00:21:45,380
And he told me I harsh-ed his buzz.

423
00:21:46,349 --> 00:21:48,345
Then I said, ''Don't eat that.

424
00:21:48,345 --> 00:21:50,341
It's a kitchen magnet.''

425
00:21:51,454 --> 00:21:53,922
And he didn't listen,

426
00:21:53,922 --> 00:21:56,390
so we left him in the emergency room.

427
00:21:56,493 --> 00:21:58,859
Mon, I'm sorry.

428
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,225
What a tool.

429
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:03,811
You did the right thing.

430
00:22:03,811 --> 00:22:06,291
You don't wanna work for that guy.

431
00:22:06,403 --> 00:22:09,304
I just thought that this was it.

432
00:22:09,406 --> 00:22:12,404
Don't worry. You're an amazing chef.

433
00:22:12,404 --> 00:22:15,402
Those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.

434
00:22:16,346 --> 00:22:17,830
Am I gonna get paid

435
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,314
for the full three hours?

436
00:22:19,349 --> 00:22:21,283
Just a question.

437
00:22:21,283 --> 00:22:23,217
We'll talk about it later.

438
00:22:27,324 --> 00:22:29,315
So, how did it go with Celia?

439
00:22:31,227 --> 00:22:33,223
I was unbelievable.

440
00:22:33,223 --> 00:22:35,219
All right, Ross!

441
00:22:35,332 --> 00:22:36,429
I was the James Michener

442
00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:37,526
of dirty talk.

443
00:22:38,268 --> 00:22:39,365
It was the most elaborate filth

444
00:22:39,365 --> 00:22:40,462
ever heard.

445
00:22:41,271 --> 00:22:43,802
I mean, there were characters,

446
00:22:43,802 --> 00:22:46,333
plot lines, themes, a motif.

447
00:22:46,443 --> 00:22:49,344
At one point, there were villagers.

448
00:22:51,281 --> 00:22:52,339
And--?

449
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:55,763
By the time we finished

450
00:22:55,763 --> 00:22:58,433
all the dirty talk it was late

452
00:22:58,433 --> 00:22:59,479
and we were exhausted--

453
00:23:00,223 --> 00:23:01,320
You cuddled.

454
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,417
Yeah, which was nice.

455
00:23:03,293 --> 00:23:04,857
Do you guys want to try to catch

456
00:23:04,857 --> 00:23:06,421
a late movie?

457
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,828
Shouldn't we wait for Chandler?

458
00:23:08,828 --> 00:23:10,426
Where the hell is he?

459
00:23:11,301 --> 00:23:15,287
I know what time it is but I'm looking at the WENUS

461
00:23:15,287 --> 00:23:17,238
and I'm not happy!

462
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,408
Let me tell you something.

463
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:22,724
You will care about it because

464
00:23:22,724 --> 00:23:25,238
I care about it. Got it? Good!

465
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,424
How's this?

466
00:23:42,232 --> 00:23:44,325
Sorry. How about over here?

467
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:46,335
That means it's working.

468
00:23:46,369 --> 00:23:47,364
Does this hurt?

469
00:23:47,364 --> 00:23:48,359
No.

470
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:51,230
How about this?

471
00:23:51,374 --> 00:23:53,467
There you go!
