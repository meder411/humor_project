1
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:03,459
Stocks and bonds are moving higher....

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:06,432
Why are we watching the Business Channel?

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,438
The other day there was a stock with my initials, M-E-G, on it.

4
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:16,438
Sometimes it takes hours to come up again but when it does, it's exciting.

5
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:21,447
Okay, honey, you really need a job.

6
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:25,285
Dad knows someone you can call for an interview.

7
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,452
Right there! That's the third sign today.

8
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:33,398
On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say, ''Huh?''

9
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:43,365
You just said ''Dad.'' Everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to see my father. When I was walking over, I passed a ''buffet.''

11
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,471
Which is my father's last name.

12
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:53,513
And they were serving franks, which is his first name minus the S.

13
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:59,290
And there was a rotisserie with a spinning ''chicken.''

14
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,519
His Indian name?

15
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:11,269
No. Because I ''chickened'' out the last time when I tried to meet him. Coincidences? I don't think so.

17
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:12,321
Very freaky.

18
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:13,271
Weird. Eerie.

19
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,273
Who wants the last burger?

20
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,434
That's it. I have to go see him.

21
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:19,307
Why?

22
00:01:19,307 --> 00:01:20,336
Hamburger.

23
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,348
McDonald's.

24
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:27,251
Old McDonald had a ''farm.'' My dad is a pharmacist.

25
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:33,348
And E-I-E-I-O is what your mom said when your dad left her.

26
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,343
Yes.

27
00:01:34,343 --> 00:01:35,293
Really?

28
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,261
No.

29
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:25,911
Man, I am so beat.

30
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:27,378
Oh, yeah.

31
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:29,460
Wanna forget racquetball and hang out?

32
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,473
Yeah, all right.

33
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,354
Hey, you're in our seats.

34
00:02:36,354 --> 00:02:38,254
Sorry, we didn't know.

35
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,485
We were sitting there.

36
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:43,294
Okay. There is one more way to say it.

37
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,263
Who knows it?

38
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:48,883
Was that supposed to be funny?

39
00:02:48,883 --> 00:02:51,300
Actually, I was going for colorful.

40
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,887
What's with this guy?

41
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:54,303
What's with you?

42
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:57,468
Nothing. Nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee.

43
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,248
What just happened?

44
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:11,212
I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too.

45
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,259
My joke is that I took your hat.

46
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:17,228
That is funny.

47
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:18,862
Can I have it back?

48
00:03:18,862 --> 00:03:20,261
No.

49
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:22,781
No?

50
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:23,327
No.

51
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:26,438
Okay. Okay.

52
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,275
You know what? I think you're very funny.

53
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,335
Kudos on that hat joke.

54
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,283
But come on, just give him back the hat.

55
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,452
Why should we?

56
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,245
Because it's a special hat.

57
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:51,259
He bought it because he was feeling down one day. He got the hat to cheer himself up, you know?

59
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,830
Chandler--

60
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,263
Stop talking. Stop talking now.

61
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,303
You're stealing my hat?

62
00:03:58,303 --> 00:04:00,237
You got a problem with that?

63
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:03,434
No, just want to make sure we're on the same page.

64
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:09,247
Rach, I've gone dad-hunting with Phoebe before.

65
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:18,350
This is a very scary thing for her. She gets real vulnerable and that's why we're there, to be supportive and crap.

67
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:22,251
Okay. You just let me know when to do which.

68
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,362
How did the interview go?

69
00:04:26,362 --> 00:04:27,459
It bit.

70
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,326
It was a '50s theme restaurant.

71
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:35,339
I'd have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter.

72
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,242
I was a sous chef at CafÃ© des Artistes.

73
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:42,271
How can I take a job where I make Laverne-and-Curly fries?

74
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:43,394
So, don't do it.

75
00:04:43,394 --> 00:04:44,440
How can I not?

76
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,452
I have $1 27 in the bank!

77
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,920
Monica, relax. Go get a beer.

78
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,354
I don't want a beer.

79
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,484
Who said it was for you?

80
00:04:58,564 --> 00:04:59,878
Hi.

81
00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:01,192
Hi.

82
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,202
What's the matter with you?

83
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,295
Some mean guys at the coffeehouse took my hat.

84
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,356
No!

85
00:05:07,356 --> 00:05:08,306
You're kidding!

86
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:13,311
It was ridiculous. These guys were bullies. Actual bullies.

87
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:17,315
We're grownups. This isn't supposed to happen anymore.

88
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,312
Oh, no, wait a minute. I have no one.

89
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:29,327
Let's go down there and get your hat back.

90
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:34,231
Forget it. It's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.

91
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:36,866
I went up!

92
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:37,463
What?

93
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:41,331
My stock, MEG, it went up two points.

94
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:49,447
Do you realize if I'd invested my $1 27 in myself yesterday that I'd, like, have a lot more than that today.

96
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,383
You know what? I'm going to do it.

97
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,465
Do what?

98
00:05:54,465 --> 00:05:55,477
Put all my money in me.

99
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,553
You don't know a thing about the stock market.

100
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:04,286
What's to know? Buy, sell. High, low. Bears, bulls. Yes, Manhattan.

101
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,201
Telephone number to the stock selling store.

103
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:22,314
I told you these pillows were a good idea.

104
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,410
Oh, God.

105
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,209
Here we go.

106
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,313
For the first time in my life, I'll say, ''Hi, birth Father!''

107
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:32,807
Love you. We're here for you.

108
00:06:32,807 --> 00:06:34,257
Good luck.

109
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,453
Thanks.

110
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,479
Hey, Rach, you want some sandwich?

111
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,527
What is in that?

112
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,817
Olive loaf and ham spread. No mayo.

113
00:06:45,817 --> 00:06:48,365
No, because mayo would make it gross.

114
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,828
Run, Phoebe, run!

115
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:55,278
No, doggy, please!

116
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,545
I do so want to love all animals. Please, no.

117
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,280
You got a bone?

118
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,275
Are you kidding?

119
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,379
Look, kibbles! Bits!

120
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,418
Get the hell off my leg, you yippity piece of crap!

121
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,301
Okay. All right. We have a problem.

122
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:21,196
Why don't you reach out and take his trampoline?

123
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,724
Here, I know what we can do.

124
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:24,208
Hey! No!

125
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:28,404
Okay, doggy, get the sandwich!

126
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:32,343
Go get the sandwich! Good doggy. Get the sandwich!

127
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:36,450
The dog will lick himself but won't touch your sandwich.

128
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,214
What does that tell you?

129
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:40,824
I'll eat it then.

130
00:07:40,824 --> 00:07:42,223
Are you crazy?

131
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,229
He's just a little dog.

132
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:53,288
Hey.

133
00:07:53,288 --> 00:07:54,238
What?

134
00:07:54,340 --> 00:08:00,279
Do you have to be a Century 21 real estate agent to wear the cool jackets?

135
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,406
Do you say this stuff to girls?

136
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:10,212
Hey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?

137
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,190
And look where they're sitting.

138
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:19,324
You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door.

139
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,865
Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.

140
00:08:20,865 --> 00:08:22,298
Yeah.

141
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,496
This couch belongs to us.

142
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:35,346
I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then we'll call the couch...and we'll see who it comes to.

145
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:42,319
Know what I don't like about you? You always got something to say.

146
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,412
Well, that--

147
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:51,260
You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.

148
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,321
All right, that's it.

149
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:57,232
I have had enough of this, all right. Gunther.

150
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,306
These guys are trying to take our seat.

151
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,300
Fellas, these guys were here first.

152
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,372
Oh, sorry.

153
00:09:05,372 --> 00:09:06,367
Didn't realize.

154
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,777
There you go.

155
00:09:08,777 --> 00:09:10,375
Thank you, Gunther.

156
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:16,186
We didn't want to have to go and do that.

157
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,313
He told on us?

158
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,283
You told on us?

159
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:24,228
Well, pal, you didn't give me much of a choice.

160
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:26,748
Don't play with his thing.

161
00:09:26,748 --> 00:09:28,198
I know.

162
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,396
All right.

163
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,304
Let's take this outside.

164
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,234
''Let's take this outside''?

165
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,439
Who talks like that?

166
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,346
The guy who's about to kick your ass talks like that.

167
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:49,871
You had to ask.

168
00:09:49,871 --> 00:09:51,321
Yeah.

169
00:09:54,226 --> 00:10:00,422
Okay. Okay, look. See the thing is, we're not gonna fight you guys.

171
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,264
Then here's the deal:

172
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:08,273
You won't have to, so long as you never show your faces here again.

173
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,439
I think you played the Gunther card too soon.

174
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,355
Hey, Pheebs, I think you're good to go.

175
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,482
Yeah. I don't know.

176
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,309
What's the matter?

177
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:33,357
I think this was a really bad sign.

178
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,368
Like the beast at the threshold, you know.

179
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,262
It's just I have no family left.

180
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:46,267
Except for my grandmother. But she's not gonna be around forever.

181
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,472
Despite what she says.

182
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:54,376
And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we shared a womb.

183
00:10:55,388 --> 00:11:01,224
I don't know. This is my real father and I want things to be just right.

184
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,823
I completely understand.

185
00:11:02,823 --> 00:11:04,319
Whatever you need.

186
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,431
Hey, you wanna go home?

187
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,258
Okay, thanks. Sorry again.

188
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,446
What was that?

189
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:39,262
I'm guessing the threshold's clear now.

190
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,267
I wanna buy five shares of SGJ, now.

191
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,465
Come on, time is money, my friend!

192
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,503
Thank you!

193
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,506
''Time is money, my friend''?

194
00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:00,417
You missed ''Takes money to make money,'' and ''Don't make me come down and kick your Wall Street butt.''

196
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,314
I made $1 7 before breakfast. What have you done?

197
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:08,258
I had breakfast here, so technically I saved $3.50.

198
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,225
How did you make $1 7?

199
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:17,461
Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and bought shares of CHP and ZXY.

201
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,328
How come those?

202
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:24,341
Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Erik Estrada.

203
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:29,338
And ZXY because I think it sounds ''zexy.''

204
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,372
What happened to MEG?

205
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,351
MEG was good for me, but I dumped her.

206
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:38,253
My motto is, ''Get out before they go down.''

207
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,250
That is so not my motto.

208
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:47,330
Hey.

209
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:48,262
Hey, Pheebs.

210
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:48,880
How's the dog?

211
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,460
Yeah.

212
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:53,404
I talked to the vet. People are so nice upstate.

213
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:59,274
He said the little fella's gonna be okay, and I can pick him up tomorrow.

214
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,302
But he had to have stitches.

215
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:06,248
And he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back.

216
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,344
Still hoping.

217
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:16,260
Now will you call your dad to let him know that his dog is okay?

218
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:21,263
I don't want to meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say?

219
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:25,429
''I'm the daughter you abandoned. By the way, I broke your dog.''

220
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,406
Hey, Pheebs, if you want, I'll do it.

221
00:13:28,406 --> 00:13:30,374
Okay.

222
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,440
Listen, just don't say anything about me, okay?

223
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:41,283
Don't...be too long with the phone.

225
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:45,346
She'll be a much better friend once the market closes.

226
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:48,858
It's a woman.

227
00:13:48,858 --> 00:13:50,257
So talk to her.

228
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,400
Hello, Mrs. Buffay.

229
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,300
I know where your dog is.

230
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:08,403
I want you to know he'll be returned to you almost as good as new within 24 hours. Goodbye.

232
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:16,216
Why the voice?

233
00:14:16,216 --> 00:14:17,211
Hard to say.

234
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,359
Your cappuccino, sir.

235
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:24,259
Thank you.

236
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,245
This is better than the coffeehouse.

237
00:14:29,245 --> 00:14:31,224
Absolutely.

238
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:42,278
How come it's not mixing with the water?

239
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:47,342
The package says to keep it moving. Stir and drink, never let it settle.

240
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,459
Hey, this is ridiculous.

241
00:14:54,493 --> 00:15:02,296
After I get back from my niece's christening we'll all go to the coffeehouse and have a nice cup of coffee.

243
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,427
No problem. Joey's there.

244
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,398
Okay.

245
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:07,853
No.

246
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:09,201
No?

247
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:14,507
I don't want to have to have Joey with me every time I want decent coffee.

248
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,307
And I don't want to drink cappuccino with a K.

249
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,511
I say we go down there and stand up to those guys.

250
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,415
All right, hang on a second, Custer.

251
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:27,889
Ross, have you been beaten up before?

252
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:29,453
Yeah, sure.

253
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,280
By someone besides Monica?

254
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,231
No.

255
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:39,329
So what if we get beaten up? Maybe it's something a man has to go through.

256
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:42,340
Like a rite of passage or something.

257
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:46,241
Couldn't we just lose our virginities again?

258
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:50,242
Because I think, actually, mine's growing back.

259
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,282
Are you with me or not? Come on.

260
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:54,444
I'm with you.

261
00:15:54,486 --> 00:16:00,223
Just let me put on a clean pair of underwear for the hospital.

263
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,340
I need to borrow $100.

264
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,386
What?

265
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,330
Welcome home.

266
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,348
I need $100.

267
00:16:07,348 --> 00:16:08,298
For what?

268
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,830
To get back in the game.

269
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,326
When did you get out?

270
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,819
I don't know. I lost it all.

271
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:14,235
Oh, no.

272
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,400
I've come to terms with it, you have to, too.

273
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,312
Okay.

274
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:23,440
Look, Mon, I'm really sorry.

275
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,729
Where are we on the 100 bucks?

276
00:16:25,729 --> 00:16:27,242
I don't have it.

277
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,310
But, I need it!

278
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:37,455
Otherwise, I have to take that horrible diner job with the dancing and the costumes.

280
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:43,458
I don't want to have to wear flame-retardant boobs.

281
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,431
Nobody does, honey.

282
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,470
Hi.

283
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,465
Schnoodle!

284
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:56,374
Oh, my God. What the hell happened to my dog?

285
00:16:56,448 --> 00:17:01,385
It was an accident. The woman who did this wouldn't hurt a dog on purpose.

286
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,184
She's a vegetarian.

287
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,436
Are these stitches?

288
00:17:05,436 --> 00:17:06,482
Eight of them.

289
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,387
That's 56 to him.

290
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:16,425
If it's raining, you can't let him look up because that cone will fill up fast.

292
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,354
Thanks for bringing him back.

293
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:21,305
Sure. Is Frank home?

294
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,420
How do you know Frank?

295
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,433
Just from a long time ago. Is he here?

296
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,276
Yeah.

297
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,831
Frank!

298
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:31,315
Yeah?

299
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,248
What?

300
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,253
Oh, okay. I mean Frank Senior.

301
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,868
He went for groceries.

302
00:17:37,868 --> 00:17:39,415
Will he be back soon?

303
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:44,355
He left four years ago. We're expecting him back any minute.

304
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:51,299
I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog. Everything. I'm sorry.

305
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,462
Hey, lady!

306
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,466
Hey, wait up!

307
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,243
How do you know my dad?

308
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:06,274
Well, I don't really just genetically.

310
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,376
He's kind of my dad too.

311
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,367
Heavy.

312
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:11,413
Yeah.

313
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:16,326
So did he ever talk about me? Phoebe?

314
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:20,491
No, but he didn't really talk about anything.

315
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,198
Except stilts.

316
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,266
Stilts?

317
00:18:25,266 --> 00:18:26,329
Yeah, he loved stilts.

318
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:38,309
One time, I was upstairs stealing cigarettes from my mom and all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head, bobbing past the window.

321
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:44,422
He had a big smile on his face and was waving because he was happiest on his stilts.

323
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:46,920
Wow.

324
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,416
Yeah.

325
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,296
I don't know what to do with that.

326
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,264
Me neither.

327
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:57,898
So you're, like, my big sister?

328
00:18:57,898 --> 00:18:59,428
Yeah.

329
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,372
This is huge. You can buy me beer!

330
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,409
I'm not gonna.

331
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:10,170
You know what? If you had a friend named Pete, I could say:

332
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:13,274
''I know Pete. He's friends with my brother.''

333
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,802
I got a friend named Mark.

334
00:19:14,802 --> 00:19:16,286
That'll work.

335
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,289
Cool. All right.

336
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:23,283
So maybe, you know, I could give you a call sometime.

337
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,875
We could talk or something.

338
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,422
Yeah, that'd be okay.

339
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,897
All right.

340
00:19:27,897 --> 00:19:29,296
Okay, I'm in the book.

341
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,392
All right.

342
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,299
So stilts, huh?

343
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:41,243
If you want, I can show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter.

344
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,246
Okay.

345
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:50,352
Well, we did it. We're here. We are standing our ground.

346
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,371
How long does a cup of coffee take?

347
00:19:53,371 --> 00:19:55,419
Would you come on?!

348
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,429
Thank you.

349
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:11,358
There we go.

350
00:20:11,358 --> 00:20:13,275
I think we proved our point.

351
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,742
You burn your mouth?

352
00:20:15,742 --> 00:20:17,238
Cannot feel my tongue.

353
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,253
Bullies! Big bullies!

354
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:26,447
Look who's here. It's the weenies.

355
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,441
Didn't we make ourselves clear?

356
00:20:30,441 --> 00:20:32,489
Yes, and that's why we're here.

357
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,460
Yes, we're standing our ground.

358
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,468
Apparently.

359
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,385
Let's do this.

360
00:20:39,385 --> 00:20:40,500
What do you got, a weapon?

361
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,500
A nice watch. I don't want to break it on your ribs.

362
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,370
All right, let's do this.

363
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:52,477
Question: If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon?

364
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,932
What?

365
00:20:53,932 --> 00:20:55,280
It's sharp and metal.

366
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,289
I think I can do some serious damage with it.

367
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,423
No, you can't use your watch.

368
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,339
Or your keys.

369
00:21:03,339 --> 00:21:04,351
Okay.

370
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,326
Here's what we'll do.

371
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:10,233
We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there.

372
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:11,398
All right?

373
00:21:11,398 --> 00:21:12,427
Yeah, all right.

374
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:16,239
All right, come on, man. Let's do this!

375
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:19,435
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?

376
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,444
Of course. Why wouldn't we?

377
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:25,341
I have to work on Monday. I have a big presentation.

378
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,477
Actually, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow.

379
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:33,349
This no-faces thing might not be a bad idea.

380
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:39,387
Nothing from the neck up or the waist down.

382
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,880
Dana's ovulating.

383
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,461
Really? You guys trying again?

384
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:47,361
So we're strictly talking about the middle?

385
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:47,966
Come on!

386
00:21:47,966 --> 00:21:48,460
Hey!

387
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,374
Want some of this? Want a piece of this?

388
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,467
I'm standing here! Huh?

389
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:55,495
Hey! Those guys are taking our stuff!

390
00:21:55,495 --> 00:21:57,412
Hey!

391
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,473
Get out of the way! Look out!

392
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:04,220
That was amazing. That was incredible.

393
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,388
You guys kicked butt!

394
00:22:05,388 --> 00:22:06,520
What about you?

395
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:10,228
You really gave it to Mr. Clean back there.

396
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,394
He was a big guy.

397
00:22:11,394 --> 00:22:12,526
He was, wasn't he?

398
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,347
I wouldn't know, having missed it all.

399
00:22:15,347 --> 00:22:17,429
Don't do that to yourself.

400
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:22,429
Any one of us could have tripped over that little girl's jump rope.

401
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:29,243
So listen, guys...are we okay here?

403
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,864
We're okay.

404
00:22:32,864 --> 00:22:34,445
So, can I have my hat back?

405
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:37,479
No.

406
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:53,496
Oh, my God. Look at her.

407
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,273
Hi, Monica!

408
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:57,499
How's it going?

409
00:22:58,276 --> 00:22:59,402
Hey, nice boobs.

410
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:03,337
Guys, check this out.

411
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,331
Excellent.
