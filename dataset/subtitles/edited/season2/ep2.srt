1
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:14,288
These were expensive, and he'll grow out of them in, like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist.

3
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:19,360
Look at these.

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,371
Hey, Ben. ''Just do it.''

5
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:25,499
Oh, my God.

6
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,370
Was that too much pressure for him?

7
00:00:29,514 --> 00:00:31,510
Wow, is he hungry already?

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,506
I guess so.

9
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:35,478
You know, it's--

10
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,289
Something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back.

11
00:00:43,294 --> 00:00:44,488
I gotta get one too.

12
00:00:47,432 --> 00:00:49,400
Hey, what are you guys doing?

13
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,435
We're just hanging out by the spoons.

14
00:00:52,537 --> 00:00:54,300
Ladle?

15
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:58,432
Will you grow up? This is the most beautiful thing in the world.

16
00:00:58,543 --> 00:01:01,444
We know. But there's a baby sucking on it.

17
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:09,345
This is my son having lunch, okay? It'll happen a lot so get used to it.

18
00:01:09,387 --> 00:01:14,450
If you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it.

19
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:18,928
Carol?

20
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:20,361
Carol?

21
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:27,268
I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?

22
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:29,268
Sure.

23
00:01:31,375 --> 00:01:32,467
Does it hurt?

24
00:01:34,278 --> 00:01:36,371
It did at first, but not anymore.

25
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:37,503
Chandler?

26
00:01:39,484 --> 00:01:42,476
So how often can you do it?

27
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:44,513
As much as he needs.

28
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,391
Okay, I got one, I got one.

29
00:01:50,394 --> 00:01:54,296
If he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?

30
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,280
Do you have muffins left?

31
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:45,896
Yeah, I forget which ones.

32
00:02:45,896 --> 00:02:47,477
You're busy. I'll get it.

33
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:49,001
Anyone else want one?

34
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:50,417
No, thanks.

35
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:54,281
You're losing your apron. Let me get it.

36
00:02:54,392 --> 00:02:55,359
There you go.

37
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:56,326
Thank you.

38
00:02:58,296 --> 00:02:59,490
What a bitch!

39
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:08,430
I have a friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting and wants to abuse his discount.

41
00:03:08,472 --> 00:03:11,236
Want to come take advantage of it?

42
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:15,277
Oh, I can't. I have to take my grandmother to the vet.

43
00:03:18,482 --> 00:03:19,466
I'll go with you.

44
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:20,450
Great.

45
00:03:23,354 --> 00:03:24,304
Hi, honey.

46
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,254
Hey, sweetums.

47
00:03:26,357 --> 00:03:28,382
And hello to the rest.

48
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:35,460
Monica, you can't go shopping with her. What about Rachel?

49
00:03:35,499 --> 00:03:37,433
Will it be a problem?

50
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:39,367
Bloomingdale's with Julie?

51
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,406
It's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship.

52
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:46,376
Monica, she will kill you.

53
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:51,380
She will kill you like a dog in the street!

54
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,482
Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow.

55
00:03:59,423 --> 00:04:01,874
It's actually not that big a deal--

56
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,325
It is to me. This is great.

57
00:04:04,428 --> 00:04:06,419
I really appreciate this.

58
00:04:06,464 --> 00:04:08,329
You're welcome.

59
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:24,339
Bijan for men?

60
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:27,246
Bijan for men?

61
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,545
Bijan for men?

62
00:04:30,454 --> 00:04:31,404
Hey, Annabel.

63
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:32,354
Hey, Joey.

64
00:04:32,456 --> 00:04:33,468
You hear about the new guy?

65
00:04:33,468 --> 00:04:34,480
Who?

66
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:40,390
Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls call him ''the Hombre Man.''

67
00:04:49,273 --> 00:04:50,365
Hombre?

68
00:04:55,313 --> 00:04:57,372
What's he doing in my section?

69
00:04:57,481 --> 00:04:59,346
I guess he doesn't know.

70
00:04:59,346 --> 00:05:01,211
Well, he's gonna.

71
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,221
I'll see you a little later, okay?

72
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:09,325
Hey, how you doing?

73
00:05:09,427 --> 00:05:11,327
Mornin'.

74
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:20,362
Listen, I know you're new but it's understood that everything from young men's to the escalator is my territory.

76
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,331
Your territory?

77
00:05:25,443 --> 00:05:26,393
Bijan for men?

78
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:27,343
No, thanks.

79
00:05:27,445 --> 00:05:29,242
Hombre?

80
00:05:29,347 --> 00:05:31,474
Yeah, all right.

81
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:40,280
You were saying?

82
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:47,297
Listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day.

83
00:05:47,398 --> 00:05:48,427
What?

84
00:05:48,427 --> 00:05:49,456
We shopped and had lunch.

85
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,461
All right. What did I have?

86
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,282
You had a salad.

87
00:05:54,282 --> 00:05:56,295
No wonder I don't feel full.

88
00:05:56,374 --> 00:05:57,398
Hi! What's up?

89
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,402
We went shopping, and I had a salad.

90
00:06:03,214 --> 00:06:05,239
Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?

91
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:09,215
We went shopping for....

92
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,409
For....

93
00:06:11,255 --> 00:06:13,314
For fur.

94
00:06:15,359 --> 00:06:18,226
You went shopping for fur?

95
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:25,326
And then I realized that I'm against that. So then we bought some....

96
00:06:27,238 --> 00:06:27,533
Boobs.

97
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,468
You bought boobs?

98
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:39,375
Bras!

99
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:41,375
We bought bras!

100
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:44,445
We bought bras.

101
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,288
Bijan for men?

102
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,360
Bijan for men?

103
00:06:51,395 --> 00:06:52,555
Bijan for--

104
00:06:54,398 --> 00:06:55,558
Hey, Annabel.

105
00:06:56,367 --> 00:07:00,394
I was wondering if, after work, we could grab a cup of coffee?

106
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:04,235
Actually, I sort of have plans.

107
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:09,439
You ready, Annabel?

108
00:07:11,248 --> 00:07:12,408
You bet.

109
00:07:14,318 --> 00:07:16,445
Maybe some other time.

110
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:30,323
Not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne.

111
00:07:30,434 --> 00:07:32,265
Bijan for men?

112
00:07:32,436 --> 00:07:34,267
Bijan for men!

113
00:07:35,473 --> 00:07:37,441
Okay, this is Funny Clown.

114
00:07:37,475 --> 00:07:41,343
It's for after his naps, not before or he won't sleep.

115
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:45,245
We've been through this before. We have a good time.

116
00:07:45,282 --> 00:07:49,378
We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son.

117
00:07:50,354 --> 00:07:53,346
Honey, relax. Ross is great with him.

118
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:57,450
Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person.

119
00:07:59,463 --> 00:08:01,294
This is so cute.

120
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,229
I got that for him.

121
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:05,199
''My Mommies Love Me.''

122
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:10,434
That's clever.

123
00:08:11,442 --> 00:08:12,431
Hello.

124
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:14,438
Oh, hi, Jul--

125
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:17,407
Hi, Jew!

126
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,443
Okay, sure.

127
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:27,222
That'd be great. See you then. Bye.

128
00:08:27,358 --> 00:08:29,349
Did you just say, ''Hi, Jew''?

129
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:36,233
Yes, yes, I did.

130
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,427
That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz.

131
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:46,437
He's going through this whole religious thing.

132
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,445
Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith.

133
00:08:55,286 --> 00:08:57,345
Ben, dinner!

134
00:08:58,289 --> 00:08:59,381
Thanks, Aunt Pheebs.

135
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:03,290
Did you microwave it? You can't do that to breast milk.

136
00:09:03,394 --> 00:09:06,420
I think I know how to heat breast milk.

137
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:12,293
What did you just do?

138
00:09:12,403 --> 00:09:14,303
I licked my arm. What?

139
00:09:14,338 --> 00:09:16,289
It's breast milk!

140
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,240
So?

141
00:09:18,342 --> 00:09:21,402
Phoebe, that is juice squeezed from a person.

142
00:09:23,314 --> 00:09:25,305
What is the big deal?

143
00:09:27,351 --> 00:09:29,319
What did you just do?

144
00:09:31,422 --> 00:09:34,448
Okay, can people stop drinking the breast milk?

145
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:37,794
You won't even taste it?

146
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:39,261
No!

147
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,421
Even if you pretend it's milk?

148
00:09:42,232 --> 00:09:46,328
Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.

149
00:09:53,477 --> 00:09:55,411
Where is everyone?

150
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,345
At the park. Where have you been?

151
00:09:57,481 --> 00:09:58,470
Just out.

152
00:09:59,249 --> 00:10:03,345
Had some lunch. Just me. A little quality time with me.

153
00:10:04,455 --> 00:10:05,501
Thanks for the jacket.

154
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:06,547
No problem.

155
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,384
You can borrow it, by the way.

156
00:10:10,461 --> 00:10:13,294
Oh, here are your keys, honey.

157
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,360
If you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you $53?

158
00:10:23,474 --> 00:10:26,272
You know what probably happened?

159
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:29,369
Someone must have stolen my credit card.

160
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,311
And sort of just put the receipt in your pocket?

161
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:36,582
That is an excellent, excellent question.

162
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:38,413
That is excellent.

163
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,520
What's with you? Who did you have lunch with?

164
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:43,856
Judy.

165
00:10:43,856 --> 00:10:44,385
Who?

166
00:10:44,495 --> 00:10:44,961
Julie.

167
00:10:44,961 --> 00:10:45,427
What?

168
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:47,326
Jody.

169
00:10:48,532 --> 00:10:50,329
You were with Julie?

170
00:10:51,502 --> 00:10:58,341
When it started, I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend.

172
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:07,283
And then one thing led to another and before I knew it, we were shopping.

175
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:12,387
Oh, my God.

176
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:17,483
Honey, wait. We only did it once.

177
00:11:18,495 --> 00:11:21,464
It didn't mean anything to me.

178
00:11:23,567 --> 00:11:27,298
Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time.

179
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:34,273
Look, I'm sorry, all right? I never meant for you to find out.

180
00:11:34,311 --> 00:11:37,508
Oh, please! Please! You wanted to get caught!

181
00:11:38,382 --> 00:11:39,474
That is not true!

182
00:11:39,516 --> 00:11:42,314
You just happen to leave it in here?

183
00:11:43,387 --> 00:11:47,483
Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?

184
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:52,387
Okay, Monica. I just have to know one thing.

185
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:57,529
Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?

186
00:12:11,248 --> 00:12:15,275
Okay, I just really need to not be with you right now.

187
00:12:26,396 --> 00:12:27,385
Hi, who's this?

188
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:31,366
Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica.

189
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:34,362
Yes, I know I did a horrible thing.

190
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:37,372
Joanne, it's not as simple as all that.

191
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:43,378
No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve.

192
00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:49,376
How did we do?

193
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:52,320
I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out.

194
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,314
I did not freak out.

195
00:12:54,424 --> 00:12:56,403
Why'd you freak out?

196
00:12:56,403 --> 00:12:58,382
Because it's breast milk.

197
00:12:59,296 --> 00:13:00,780
It's gross.

198
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,264
My breast milk is gross?

199
00:13:04,268 --> 00:13:05,462
This should be fun.

200
00:13:08,238 --> 00:13:13,335
There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't think breast milk is for adults.

201
00:13:13,443 --> 00:13:18,346
Of course, the packaging does appeal to grownups and kids alike.

202
00:13:19,349 --> 00:13:25,254
Don't be silly. I've tried it. It's no big deal. Come on, just taste it.

203
00:13:25,355 --> 00:13:27,346
That would be no.

204
00:13:28,258 --> 00:13:29,253
Come on. Try it.

205
00:13:29,253 --> 00:13:30,248
It's natural.

206
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,452
It doesn't taste bad.

207
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:34,497
It tastes kind of sweet. Sort of like....

208
00:13:35,265 --> 00:13:36,260
Like what?

209
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,255
Cantaloupe juice.

210
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:38,493
Exactly.

211
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:47,373
You've tasted it.

212
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:49,472
You've tasted it.

213
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:53,483
Oh, you've tasted it.

214
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,320
You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.

215
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,455
Give me the bottle.

216
00:14:14,238 --> 00:14:15,330
Get me the towel.

217
00:14:40,397 --> 00:14:41,364
Howdy.

218
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,491
Give me a box of juice.

219
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:50,398
They switched me over to Hombre.

220
00:14:50,574 --> 00:14:54,305
Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.

221
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,375
Or maybe this guy's so good they want to put more people on it.

222
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:02,317
This guy goes through two bottles a day now.

223
00:15:04,421 --> 00:15:06,252
What do you care?

224
00:15:07,224 --> 00:15:10,250
You're an actor. This is a day job. It's nothing.

225
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,521
I know, but I was the best.

226
00:15:13,263 --> 00:15:16,323
You know? I liked being the best.

227
00:15:20,437 --> 00:15:22,462
Maybe I should get out of the game.

228
00:15:23,273 --> 00:15:26,436
They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.

229
00:15:26,543 --> 00:15:28,238
Say you do that.

230
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:33,238
Sooner or later, someone will come along that slices a better cheddar.

231
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:35,818
Then where you gonna run?

232
00:15:35,818 --> 00:15:37,285
You're right.

233
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:40,551
Show him what you're made of. Stand your ground.

234
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:45,455
Show him that you're the baddest hombre west of the lingerie!

235
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:47,358
I'm gonna do it!

236
00:15:47,358 --> 00:15:48,353
All right!

237
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:53,562
Now, go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.

238
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,272
I don't know what to say.

239
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,791
Good, because I'm not listening.

240
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,208
I feel terrible. I really do.

241
00:16:02,312 --> 00:16:06,214
I'm sorry. Did my back hurt your knife?

242
00:16:07,451 --> 00:16:11,410
Say that I'm friends with her. Is that so terrible?

243
00:16:12,422 --> 00:16:13,838
It's that terrible?

244
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:15,254
You don't get it!

245
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,523
It's bad enough she stole the guy who I'm supposed to be with.

246
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:24,331
But now...she's actually....

248
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:27,462
But now she's actually stealing you.

249
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:36,242
What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you.

250
00:16:36,346 --> 00:16:41,374
Because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you.

251
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:43,445
I mean, you're my....

252
00:16:45,355 --> 00:16:46,447
And we're....

253
00:16:49,493 --> 00:16:50,977
Oh, I love you!

254
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:52,461
I love you too!

255
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:02,203
You guys, I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me.

256
00:17:02,305 --> 00:17:03,431
But I love you guys too!

257
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:12,210
I really needed that.

258
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:18,410
Look, I know right now you really need to hate Julie's guts.

259
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:21,424
But she didn't do anything wrong.

260
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:26,284
She's just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out.

261
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,462
And I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her.

262
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:34,462
Will you just give that a chance?

263
00:17:35,238 --> 00:17:36,296
For me?

264
00:17:38,442 --> 00:17:41,275
I'd do anything for you. You know that!

265
00:17:41,344 --> 00:17:43,471
I'd do anything for you!

266
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:46,348
Wait, wait, wait!

267
00:18:05,235 --> 00:18:06,395
Mornin'.

268
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:11,239
I said, mornin'!

269
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:13,501
I heard you.

270
00:18:15,312 --> 00:18:18,338
All right, everybody. I'm opening the doors.

271
00:18:19,216 --> 00:18:20,240
You boys ready?

272
00:18:25,455 --> 00:18:26,939
Ready.

273
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,423
Yeah, I'm ready.

274
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:17,398
You idiot! You stupid cowboy!

275
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:20,209
You've blinded me! I'm suing!

276
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,438
Oh, my God! Todd!

277
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,794
What the hell did you do?

278
00:19:25,794 --> 00:19:28,342
I'm sorry. I'm such a doofus!

279
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:32,252
My God, what happened?

280
00:19:32,355 --> 00:19:34,414
These new kids, they never last.

281
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:39,456
Sooner or later they all stop lasting.

283
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:44,358
What do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?

284
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:46,326
Sure.

285
00:19:58,481 --> 00:19:59,965
So.

286
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,449
So.

287
00:20:05,355 --> 00:20:10,452
I just thought we should hang out. I mean, we've never really talked.

288
00:20:10,493 --> 00:20:14,259
You'd know that, being one of the two of us.

289
00:20:14,364 --> 00:20:15,456
I know.

290
00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:23,262
I probably shouldn't say this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.

292
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:25,274
Really?

293
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,364
Me?

294
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,410
Oh, my God, are you kidding?

295
00:20:28,511 --> 00:20:33,505
Ross is crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and I....

296
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:40,483
It's probably me being totally paranoid but I kind of got the feeling that maybe you don't.

298
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:53,393
Well you're not totally paranoid.

300
00:21:01,278 --> 00:21:02,267
Oh, God.

301
00:21:04,447 --> 00:21:10,480
When you and Ross first started going out it was really hard for me.

303
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:17,486
For many reasons, of which I'm not gonna bore you with now.

304
00:21:21,464 --> 00:21:26,458
I just see how happy he is and how good you guys are together.

305
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:34,309
And Monica's always saying how nice you are and God, I hate it when she's right!

307
00:21:35,512 --> 00:21:37,377
Thanks.

308
00:21:37,514 --> 00:21:41,416
Would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?

309
00:21:41,518 --> 00:21:44,487
Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it.

310
00:21:44,521 --> 00:21:46,421
I'd love it too.

311
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,582
Shoot, I gotta go.

312
00:21:49,326 --> 00:21:50,907
So I'll talk to you later.

313
00:21:50,907 --> 00:21:52,488
All right, Julie.

314
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:03,330
What a manipulative bitch.

315
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:35,403
It's not bad.
