1
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:07,431
Hey.

2
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:09,925
What you guys doing?

3
00:00:09,925 --> 00:00:12,376
Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.

4
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:17,476
Why are you guys upset? It's Old Yeller. It's a happy movie.

5
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:21,249
What are you talking about?

6
00:00:21,249 --> 00:00:24,247
Happy family gets a dog. Frontier fun!

7
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,460
Pheebs, what about the end?

8
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:31,260
When Yeller saves the family and everyone's happy?

9
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:32,355
That's not the end.

10
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:37,493
That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say, ''The end.''

11
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:39,498
What about when he has rabies?

12
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:43,400
He doesn't have rabies. He has babies.

13
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,308
That's what my mom said.

14
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:51,475
I don't think she'd want you to see what's about to happen.

15
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:55,420
Why? What's about to happen? I've never seen this part.

16
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:58,489
Hey, Travis, what you doing with that gun?

17
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:02,351
Oh, no.

18
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,227
No, Travis, put down the gun.

19
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:07,526
No, he's your buddy. He's your Yeller.

20
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,427
No! The end! The end!

21
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:17,435
Okay, what kind of a sick doggy snuff film is this?

22
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:10,319
Have you eaten? Richard and I just finished, and we have leftovers.

23
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,354
Chicken and potatoes.

24
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,234
What am I wearing?

25
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,470
Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.

26
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:27,372
One day, you'll really be naked and we won't come over.

27
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,382
That'd teach me a lesson.

28
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:35,252
I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing.

29
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,346
How do you find clothes that fit?

30
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,550
Hey, Monica? We got a question.

31
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:44,388
Yes, I see other women in the shower at the gym.

32
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,556
And no, I don't look.

33
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,358
No, not that one.

34
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,403
We have an extra ticket to the Knicks game.

35
00:02:51,504 --> 00:03:00,303
Ross can't go, so it's between my friend Eric, who has breath issues and Dan, with the poking. ''Did you see that play?''

37
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,505
''You want more beer? Is that Spike Lee?''

38
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,412
Why don't you ask Richard?

39
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:22,266
Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks...and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you, who would you pick?

42
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,427
Wow.

43
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:29,470
Being a Knicks fan myself I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan.

45
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,468
Okay.

46
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,439
That's Eric.

47
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,244
Glad to be of help. Matches.

48
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,478
I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game?

49
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,446
What?

50
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,275
I don't know.

51
00:03:46,275 --> 00:03:47,259
Come on!

52
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,456
He keeps his fingers to himself, and he's always minty fresh.

53
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:55,462
Richard's really nice. We just don't know him really well.

54
00:03:55,501 --> 00:04:02,235
Plus, he's old...er than some people.

56
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:06,242
But younger than some buildings.

57
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,438
So he's a little older. Big deal.

58
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,410
He's important to me.

59
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:15,353
If you ask him, he might take you in his Jag.

60
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:25,322
How do we say yes and make it seem like it's not just to ride in the cool car?

62
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,456
Okay, this could be tough.

63
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,331
Monica?

64
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:34,270
We'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar.

65
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,376
You almost had it.

66
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,248
No, no, you're fine. You're fine.

67
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,255
Hi, honey.

68
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,452
You are not gonna believe what happened!

69
00:04:53,559 --> 00:05:00,230
We were on the floor, and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up!

71
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,424
He pulled himself up!

72
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,328
Standing man!

73
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:09,306
Sorry you missed it, but I taped it if you wanna see.

74
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,375
He already did it last week.

75
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,440
You can watch our tape if you want.

76
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:19,344
See, I don't believe this. I miss the first time of everything.

77
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:23,445
The first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled.

78
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:28,319
Has he spoken? Is he driving? Does he have a favorite liqueur?

79
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,228
He is getting closer on the talking thing.

80
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,357
He can't quite say ''mama,'' but once he said, ''Yemen.''

81
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:38,369
See, I don't know. I'm so sick of missing stuff.

82
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:42,338
I want him for more than a day. I want a weekend.

83
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,858
Listen. I feel--

84
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:45,274
That would be great.

85
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,476
Really? I had a whole speech prepared.

86
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,242
Shoot, that would've been fun.

87
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,381
Did you just see that?

88
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,288
Did you see? He just waved! He just waved!

89
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,419
He's never waved before!

90
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,188
Yes, he has. Very good.

91
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,334
Hey, what you got there?

92
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:14,396
Love Story, Brian's Song and Terms of Endearment.

93
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:21,243
All you need now is The Killing Fields and guacamole, and you've got a party!

94
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:31,417
I talked to my grandma about Old Yeller and she said my mom didn't show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness.

97
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:34,324
You know, before she killed herself.

98
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,323
Where's Richard? Did you ditch him?

99
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,465
After we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie.

100
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,363
What's with you? He's parking.

101
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,309
Did you guys have fun?

102
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,277
Your boyfriend is so cool.

103
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:56,372
He let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 1 2 blocks. Me for 1 5.

104
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,443
He must like you best.

105
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,379
And when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats?

106
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,187
You never saw the money. Like this:

107
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:09,319
Hey, Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats.

108
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,195
You're welcome. Hey, thanks for parking the car.

109
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,426
No problem.

110
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:17,731
Hey, Chandler--

111
00:07:17,731 --> 00:07:19,227
I think they get it.

112
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,198
There's the man!

113
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,210
You're getting better.

114
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,244
I'm gonna keep this, by the way.

115
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,317
He kept my dollar.

116
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,923
Your first weekend without Ben.

117
00:07:39,923 --> 00:07:42,323
We're going to colonial Williamsburg.

118
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:47,263
A woman I went to college with is the first female blacksmith there.

119
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:51,269
They're a little behind the times in colonial Williamsburg.

120
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,339
I better go before Mommy starts weeping.

121
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,303
We love you.

122
00:07:56,303 --> 00:07:57,332
Bye, Mommy.

123
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:58,410
Bye.

124
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,377
Have a good time.

125
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,178
Ross? Look.

126
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,192
Joey, do you know we can see you from here?

127
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,489
How come Richard looks cooler with these?

128
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:22,292
You may want to light it and lose the spatula.

129
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,429
It's cute, trying to be like Richard.

130
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:30,403
Not like him, per se. Just not unlike him.

131
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:44,219
It's the artist formerly known as Chandler.

132
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:47,324
I'm just trying something here, you know?

133
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,890
Why didn't you grow a mustache?

134
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,420
We flipped for it.

135
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:53,432
I got the cigar, he got the mustache.

136
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,359
If we both grew them, we'd look like dorks.

137
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:00,269
You really sidestepped that land mine.

138
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,402
We gotta meet Richard downstairs.

139
00:09:02,402 --> 00:09:04,398
You're meeting Richard?

140
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:05,808
Hockey.

141
00:09:05,808 --> 00:09:06,405
Didn't he tell you?

142
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:10,273
He said he'd be with the guys. I didn't know that's you.

143
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,372
You hear that?

144
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,378
We're the guys!

145
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:17,381
That mustache reminds me of Aunt Sylvia.

146
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,181
Thank you!

147
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,235
Hi. We're visiting.

148
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:34,195
It's Ben and his dada.

149
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:42,347
Can you say ''dada''? I'm gonna tell your mommies you said it anyway.

150
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,246
No luck, huh?

151
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:51,451
A while ago, I got a ''se'' out of him which I thought might turn into ''secondary caregiver,'' but....

153
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,419
Would you hold him for a sec? I gotta take this off.

154
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,432
Sure. Okay.

155
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,430
What are you doing?

156
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,464
I'm holding Ben.

157
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,473
He's a baby, not a bomb.

158
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,347
Hold him like you'd hold a football.

159
00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:20,446
This is how I would hold a football.

160
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,278
Here. Here. There we go.

161
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:27,486
Sorry, I'm not very good with babies. I haven't been around them.

162
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,251
I mean, since I was one.

163
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,813
It's all right. No big deal.

164
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:33,263
Really?

165
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,301
You'll feel different when it's our baby.

166
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,336
What?

167
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:38,303
What?

168
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,398
You think about stuff like that?

169
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,475
Yeah.

170
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:49,311
Actually, I kind of think that we'll have two babies.

171
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,312
Two babies?

172
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,376
You know, a boy and a girl.

173
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:59,322
Hopefully, the girl will come first, so Ben won't feel competitive.

174
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,359
Then what's gonna happen?

175
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:07,422
We won't wanna raise kids in the city, so we'll move to Scarsdale.

176
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:14,465
It's far enough from our parents not to see them but close enough for them to babysit.

178
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:22,347
And yes, I know the taxes are a little higher than Nassau County but the school system's great.

180
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:27,247
Wow, that's great! Great!

181
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:32,252
Okay, you know what? I'm off my break now.

182
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,485
Here. You take this.

183
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,491
I'm gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee.

184
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:46,370
Look at that. I don't have a pot. Maybe I've got one at home.

185
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:49,270
Or in Scarsdale. Hey, is that a door?

186
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:57,965
Hey.

187
00:11:57,965 --> 00:11:59,415
Hey, Pheebs. What's happening?

188
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:04,252
Murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes.

189
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,391
I was really just making small talk.

190
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:08,359
Well, I was just venting.

191
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,355
So you watched the movies?

192
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,263
What is happening to the world?

193
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:20,439
I mean, because E.T. leaves and Rocky loses. Charlotte dies.

195
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,373
Charlotte who?

196
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:26,241
With the web. The spider. She has babies and dies.

197
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:30,372
It's like, ''Welcome home from the hospital.'' Thud!

198
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,278
You wanna feel better?

199
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:33,273
Yeah.

200
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:38,288
Here. Watch this.

201
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:40,484
It's a Wonderful Life. I've heard of this.

202
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,454
You can't lose. It's there in the title.

203
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,457
Wonderfulness is baked in.

204
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:48,397
I thought so with The Pride of the Yankees.

205
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:54,303
I thought it was about Yankee pride, and the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.

206
00:12:55,474 --> 00:13:00,241
The guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kind of see it coming?

207
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:05,411
Watch that. It'll restore all your faith in humanity.

208
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,351
Hey, big guy. Game time.

209
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,886
Hey! Be right there!

210
00:13:08,886 --> 00:13:10,353
There's a game?

211
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:14,222
I just got my Pik-Up Stiks back from the shop.

212
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,422
Bring your nerves of steel.

213
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,333
It's the basketball playoffs.

214
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:26,234
I appreciate this, but you don't have to hang out with them for me.

215
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,430
They have each other.

216
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,265
Oh, no, honey. Don't worry.

217
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:34,335
I like hanging out with them. They're not like my other friends.

218
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:39,249
They don't start sentences with, ''Guess who just died shoveling snow?''

219
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:42,352
All right, that's great. Then just go.

220
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,353
Go Knicks!

221
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,290
It's the college playoffs.

222
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,421
Then, go Vassar!

223
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:48,484
They're not in it.

224
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:49,875
Okay, then just go.

225
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:50,489
Okay.

226
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,267
Why does this bother me?

227
00:13:55,367 --> 00:14:00,236
I'm not one of those people who wants to spend 24 hours a day together.

228
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,295
Sure.

229
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,433
He just doesn't have much free time. What do I do?

230
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:10,239
Does it matter? You'll ultimately die, divorce or blow your pet's head off.

231
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,208
Me too!

232
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:17,416
I got a question. Richard made plans with the guys--

233
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,424
Ross made plans for the century.

234
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:24,253
I'm gonna go read Cosmo. Maybe there's something helpful in it.

235
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:29,233
If not, I can learn how to do a bikini wax with Christmas candles.

236
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,263
What happened back there?

237
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,434
You tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben.

238
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:42,276
Then I have two kids and live in Scarsdale, complaining about taxes!

239
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,475
Well, I'm sorry. I think about stuff.

240
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,481
You're at work, assembling bones. Your mind wanders.

241
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:52,452
You planned ahead 20 years. We've dated for six weeks!

242
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,550
You never think about our future?

243
00:14:55,294 --> 00:15:00,298
I think about whose apartment we'll sleep at and where we'll have dinner!

245
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,199
I do not think about our children's names!

246
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:08,204
You know what our children's names are gonna be?

247
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,404
No. I mean, I read a book, and there was a girl named Emily.

248
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:15,504
And I thought that might be good.

249
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,410
What was the book?

250
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,220
The Big Book of Children's Names.

251
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,448
Okay, Ross. Listen.

252
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,418
What we have is amazing.

253
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,359
But I do not want everything decided for me!

254
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:34,263
I spent my whole life like that. That's the reason I left Barry.

255
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,324
I like not knowing right now.

256
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:40,429
Sorry if that scares you, but if you want me, deal with that!

257
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:41,422
Okay, fine!

258
00:15:41,422 --> 00:15:42,372
Thank you!

259
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,908
We're not done!

260
00:15:43,908 --> 00:15:45,375
I didn't know that.

261
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:49,437
You're with a guy who won't stop planning his future with you.

262
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,448
He knows we'll be together.

263
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:55,243
If that scares you, tough! Deal with that.

264
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,349
I will!

265
00:15:56,349 --> 00:15:57,344
Good, because I love you!

266
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,254
Oh, yeah? I love you too!

267
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,326
That's the first time we said it!

268
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:02,809
I'm gonna kiss you!

269
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:04,225
You better!

270
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,397
Thanks for the movie.

271
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,423
Did you like it?

272
00:16:14,423 --> 00:16:15,407
Oh, yeah.

273
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:24,405
Was I happier when George destroyed the business or Donna Reed cried or when the pharmacist made his ear bleed?

275
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,309
I'll give you that, but wasn't the ending great?

276
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:33,257
I was too depressed to watch it. It should've been called:

277
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:38,319
It's a Sucky Life, and Just When You Think It Can't Suck Anymore, It Does!

278
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:43,325
Kick, save! And denied!

280
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:47,330
He gets it back. Pass to the middle, lines it up....

281
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,436
Yes! Could that shot be any prettier?

282
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,859
Man, you are incredible.

283
00:16:54,859 --> 00:16:56,440
We had a table in college.

284
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:00,218
I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800s.

285
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:05,384
Nice mustache. When puberty hits, that thing will really kick in.

286
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:12,425
Not to sound too Florence Henderson, but dinner's ready.

287
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,187
One more point.

288
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,328
Score!

289
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,331
Now can we go?

290
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,300
That's why we don't let her play.

291
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,243
Is everything all right?

292
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,214
Don't be mad at him. It's our fault.

293
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,300
Sorry we're hogging his time.

294
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,348
He's just great to hang out with.

295
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,350
We were just talking about this.

296
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,418
He is so much cooler than our dads.

297
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:48,458
Our dads are okay and all, but Richard is just--

298
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,259
What are you kicking me for?

299
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,296
I'm trying to talk here.

300
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,443
You guys see me as a dad?

301
00:17:58,477 --> 00:17:59,444
Oh, yeah!

302
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:00,411
No!

303
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,409
No.

304
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:08,377
You're clearly not familiar with our young persons' vernacular.

305
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:12,214
When we say ''dad,'' we mean ''buddy.''

306
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,419
We mean ''pal.''

307
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,424
No, seriously. Joey's my dad.

308
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,300
Monica's my dad.

309
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,403
I've even got some dads down at work.

310
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,294
That's fine.

311
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:31,400
Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening.

312
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,434
I'll just see you kids around.

313
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,338
Nighty-night.

314
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,245
You're not a dad!

315
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,510
I can't believe you got us into trouble.

316
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,830
So are you okay?

317
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,326
Yeah.

318
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,298
Just I feel like I'm about 100.

320
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,402
I thought I was just one of the guys.

321
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,369
Come here.

322
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,307
I'll make you feel like one of the guys.

323
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:20,280
For a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.

324
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,293
What? I was killing them.

325
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,419
Yeah, well they suck too.

326
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,397
Take the poopy diaper and put it in the poopy diaper pail.

327
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:37,204
Calling it a poopy diaper doesn't make this process any cuter.

328
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,435
-Hello?
-It's us.

329
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,408
Come on up. I'll get his stuff together.

330
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:46,440
Okay, we can do this now, can't we, Ben?

331
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:51,312
Yes, we can. Yes, we can.

332
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:54,254
There! I did it!

333
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,419
I did it!

334
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,363
Look at that!

335
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,257
It stays on and everything.

336
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:03,850
Hi!

337
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,266
Hi.

338
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:12,437
I'm sorry. What did you just say? Did you just say hi?

339
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:16,237
Oh, my God! Ross? Ben just said hi!

340
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:17,864
Ben just said hi!

341
00:20:17,864 --> 00:20:19,280
The word ''hi''?

342
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,285
No, my Uncle Hi.

343
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:25,346
Great, I missed that too! I miss everything!

344
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,349
Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I just bring it out in him.

345
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:30,927
Hello! Where is he?

346
00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:32,360
We missed you.

347
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:36,265
We missed you so much! Come here, Ben.

348
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:39,360
Guess what? Ben just said his first word.

349
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:40,938
What did he say?

350
00:20:40,938 --> 00:20:42,405
Something about, ''Hi.''

351
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,440
That's so exciting!

352
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,305
Mommy's so proud of you!

353
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:49,279
Hi! Hi?

354
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:52,473
You know, actually, it's more like, ''Hi!''

355
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,357
This could go on for a while.

356
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:01,325
Yeah, we've got a cab waiting.

357
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,326
Well, this was fun.

358
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:07,321
We should do it again sometime, Ben. What do you say?

359
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,916
All right, so I've got him...?

360
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,366
Tuesday.

361
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,464
Bye, you guys.

362
00:21:11,464 --> 00:21:12,459
Take care.

363
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:14,233
Bye, Ben.

364
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:15,228
Bye.

365
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:21,371
Did he just say bye? He said bye!

366
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,278
You said bye! He said bye to me!

367
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,475
Yes, he did!

368
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,448
Suddenly I'm seeing him go off to college!

369
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:32,548
We've gotta go. We've got that cab downstairs.

370
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,255
See you later.

371
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,289
Bye!

372
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:37,284
Bye.

373
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,310
Look at this nice deep hole I dug.

374
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,315
Hey, Bert, isn't this a nice hole?

375
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:04,449
This is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him.

376
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,420
I've looked ahead on the tape, and he does find him again.

377
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:14,231
But before that happens, there's some rough going.

378
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,324
But I think we can handle it.

379
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:21,429
And there's just the alphabet, but we know that ends well, so....

380
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,468
Here we go.

381
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,335
Bert? Bert?

382
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:30,345
What happened to Bert? He was here a moment ago.

383
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,474
Oh, no! My old friend Bert is lost.

384
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,479
I'm so glad you're here.
