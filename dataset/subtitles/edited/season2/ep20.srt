1
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:07,431
Hey.

2
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:09,925
What you guys doing?

3
00:00:09,925 --> 00:00:12,376
Monica's making us watch Old Yeller.

4
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,411
Why are you guys upset?

5
00:00:15,411 --> 00:00:17,476
It's Old Yeller. It's a happy movie.

6
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:21,249
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:21,249 --> 00:00:24,247
Happy family gets a dog. Frontier fun!

8
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,460
Pheebs, what about the end?

9
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,377
When Yeller saves the family

10
00:00:29,377 --> 00:00:31,260
and everyone's happy?

11
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:32,355
That's not the end.

12
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:35,479
That's when my mother would

13
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:37,492
shut off the TV and say, ''The end.''

14
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:39,498
What about when he has rabies?

15
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:41,853
He doesn't have rabies.

16
00:00:41,853 --> 00:00:43,400
He has babies.

17
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:46,308
That's what my mom said.

18
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:49,444
I don't think she'd want you

19
00:00:49,444 --> 00:00:51,474
to see what's about to happen.

20
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,469
Why? What's about to happen?

21
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:55,420
I've never seen this part.

22
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:57,038
Hey, Travis, what you doing

23
00:00:57,038 --> 00:00:58,488
with that gun?

24
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:02,351
Oh, no.

25
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,227
No, Travis, put down the gun.

26
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:06,428
No, he's your buddy.

27
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:07,525
He's your Yeller.

28
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,427
No! The end! The end!

29
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,387
Okay, what kind of a sick

30
00:01:15,387 --> 00:01:17,435
doggy snuff film is this?

31
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,822
Have you eaten? Richard and I

32
00:02:07,822 --> 00:02:10,319
just finished, and we have leftovers.

33
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,354
Chicken and potatoes.

34
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,234
What am I wearing?

35
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,470
Actually, nothing but rubber gloves.

36
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,808
One day, you'll really be naked

37
00:02:25,808 --> 00:02:27,372
and we won't come over.

38
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,382
That'd teach me a lesson.

39
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:33,818
I've got a leg, three breasts

40
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:35,251
and a wing.

41
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,346
How do you find clothes that fit?

42
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,550
Hey, Monica? We got a question.

43
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:42,841
Yes, I see other women

44
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:44,388
in the shower at the gym.

45
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,556
And no, I don't look.

46
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,358
No, not that one.

47
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:49,935
We have an extra ticket

48
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:51,402
to the Knicks game.

49
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,938
Ross can't go, so it's between my

50
00:02:53,938 --> 00:02:58,790
friend Eric, who has breath issues and Dan, with the poking.

52
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,303
''Did you see that play?''

53
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,009
''You want more beer?

54
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:03,505
Is that Spike Lee?''

55
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,412
Why don't you ask Richard?

56
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,769
Richard, if you had

57
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:16,791
an extra ticket to the Knicks...and you had to choose between

59
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:20,315
a friend who smells and one who bruises you,

61
00:03:20,315 --> 00:03:22,266
who would you pick?

62
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,427
Wow.

63
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:27,854
Being a Knicks fan myself I think you should take someone

65
00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:29,469
who's a huge Knicks fan.

66
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,468
Okay.

67
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,439
That's Eric.

68
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,862
Glad to be of help.

69
00:03:35,862 --> 00:03:37,244
Matches.

70
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,931
I meant, why don't you

71
00:03:39,931 --> 00:03:41,478
take Richard to the game?

72
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,446
What?

73
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,275
I don't know.

74
00:03:46,275 --> 00:03:47,259
Come on!

75
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,408
He keeps his fingers to himself,

76
00:03:49,408 --> 00:03:51,456
and he's always minty fresh.

77
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,863
Richard's really nice.

78
00:03:53,863 --> 00:03:55,461
We just don't know him really well.

79
00:03:55,501 --> 00:04:02,235
Plus, he's old...er than some people.

81
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:06,242
But younger than some buildings.

82
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,438
So he's a little older. Big deal.

83
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,410
He's important to me.

84
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,402
If you ask him,

85
00:04:13,402 --> 00:04:15,353
he might take you in his Jag.

86
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:23,291
How do we say yes and make it seem like

88
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,321
it's not just to ride in the cool car?

89
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,456
Okay, this could be tough.

90
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,331
Monica?

91
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,353
We'll bring him,

92
00:04:32,353 --> 00:04:34,270
but only if he takes the Jaguar.

93
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,376
You almost had it.

94
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:47,248
No, no, you're fine. You're fine.

95
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,255
Hi, honey.

96
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,371
You are not gonna believe

97
00:04:52,371 --> 00:04:53,451
what happened!

98
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:55,407
We were on the floor,

99
00:04:55,407 --> 00:05:00,230
and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up!

101
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,424
He pulled himself up!

102
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,328
Standing man!

103
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,372
Sorry you missed it,

104
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:09,306
but I taped it if you wanna see.

105
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,375
He already did it last week.

106
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,440
You can watch our tape if you want.

107
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,279
See, I don't believe this.

108
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:19,344
I miss the first time of everything.

109
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,448
The first time he rolled over,

110
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:23,444
the first time he crawled.

111
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:26,271
Has he spoken? Is he driving?

112
00:05:26,271 --> 00:05:28,319
Does he have a favorite liqueur?

113
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,794
He is getting closer

114
00:05:29,794 --> 00:05:31,227
on the talking thing.

115
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,844
He can't quite say ''mama,''

116
00:05:32,844 --> 00:05:34,357
but once he said, ''Yemen.''

117
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,418
See, I don't know.

118
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:38,369
I'm so sick of missing stuff.

119
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,438
I want him for more than a day.

120
00:05:40,438 --> 00:05:42,338
I want a weekend.

121
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,858
Listen. I feel--

122
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:45,274
That would be great.

123
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,476
Really? I had a whole speech prepared.

124
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,242
Shoot, that would've been fun.

125
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,381
Did you just see that?

126
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,889
Did you see? He just waved!

127
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:00,288
He just waved!

128
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:02,419
He's never waved before!

129
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,188
Yes, he has. Very good.

130
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:10,334
Hey, what you got there?

131
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,399
Love Story, Brian's Song and

132
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,395
Terms of Endearment.

133
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:18,342
All you need now is The Killing Fields

134
00:06:18,342 --> 00:06:21,243
and guacamole, and you've got a party!

135
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:22,910
I talked to my grandma

136
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,429
about Old Yeller and she said my mom didn't show us

138
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:30,319
the ends of sad movies to shield us from

140
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,416
the pain and sadness.

141
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:34,324
You know, before she killed herself.

142
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,293
Where's Richard?

143
00:06:39,293 --> 00:06:40,322
Did you ditch him?

144
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,849
After we stole his lunch money

145
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:44,464
and gave him a wedgie.

146
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,363
What's with you? He's parking.

147
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,309
Did you guys have fun?

148
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,277
Your boyfriend is so cool.

149
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,358
He let us drive his Jaguar.

150
00:06:54,358 --> 00:06:56,371
Joey for 1 2 blocks. Me for 1 5.

151
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,443
He must like you best.

152
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,849
And when he tipped the guy

153
00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:03,379
who showed us to our seats?

154
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,805
You never saw the money.

155
00:07:04,805 --> 00:07:06,187
Like this:

156
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:07,772
Hey, Chandler, thanks

157
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:09,319
for showing us to our seats.

158
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,312
You're welcome.

159
00:07:11,312 --> 00:07:13,195
Hey, thanks for parking the car.

160
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,426
No problem.

161
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:17,731
Hey, Chandler--

162
00:07:17,731 --> 00:07:19,227
I think they get it.

163
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,198
There's the man!

164
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,210
You're getting better.

165
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,244
I'm gonna keep this, by the way.

166
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,317
He kept my dollar.

167
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,923
Your first weekend without Ben.

168
00:07:39,923 --> 00:07:42,323
We're going to colonial Williamsburg.

169
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,845
A woman I went to college with

170
00:07:44,845 --> 00:07:47,262
is the first female blacksmith there.

171
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,301
They're a little behind the times

172
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:51,269
in colonial Williamsburg.

173
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,854
I better go before Mommy

174
00:07:52,854 --> 00:07:54,338
starts weeping.

175
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,303
We love you.

176
00:07:56,303 --> 00:07:57,332
Bye, Mommy.

177
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:58,410
Bye.

178
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,377
Have a good time.

179
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,178
Ross? Look.

180
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,241
Joey, do you know

181
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:15,192
we can see you from here?

182
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,391
How come Richard

183
00:08:16,391 --> 00:08:17,488
looks cooler with these?

184
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,261
You may want to light it

185
00:08:20,261 --> 00:08:22,291
and lose the spatula.

186
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,429
It's cute, trying to be like Richard.

187
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,304
Not like him, per se.

188
00:08:28,304 --> 00:08:30,403
Just not unlike him.

189
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,319
It's the artist formerly known

190
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:44,219
as Chandler.

191
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:45,873
I'm just trying something here,

192
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:47,323
you know?

193
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,890
Why didn't you grow a mustache?

194
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,420
We flipped for it.

195
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:51,947
I got the cigar,

196
00:08:51,947 --> 00:08:53,431
he got the mustache.

197
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,846
If we both grew them,

198
00:08:55,846 --> 00:08:57,359
we'd look like dorks.

199
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:58,852
You really sidestepped

200
00:08:58,852 --> 00:09:00,268
that land mine.

201
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,402
We gotta meet Richard downstairs.

202
00:09:02,402 --> 00:09:04,398
You're meeting Richard?

203
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:05,808
Hockey.

204
00:09:05,808 --> 00:09:06,405
Didn't he tell you?

205
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,726
He said he'd be with the guys.

206
00:09:08,726 --> 00:09:10,273
I didn't know that's you.

207
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,372
You hear that?

208
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,378
We're the guys!

209
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:16,334
That mustache reminds me

210
00:09:16,334 --> 00:09:17,380
of Aunt Sylvia.

211
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,181
Thank you!

212
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,235
Hi. We're visiting.

213
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:34,195
It's Ben and his dada.

214
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:39,394
Can you say ''dada''? I'm gonna tell

215
00:09:39,394 --> 00:09:42,346
your mommies you said it anyway.

216
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,246
No luck, huh?

217
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,363
A while ago,

218
00:09:45,363 --> 00:09:49,335
I got a ''se'' out of him which I thought might turn into

220
00:09:49,335 --> 00:09:51,451
''secondary caregiver,'' but....

221
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,439
Would you hold him for a sec?

222
00:09:56,439 --> 00:09:58,418
I gotta take this off.

223
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:00,432
Sure. Okay.

224
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,430
What are you doing?

225
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,464
I'm holding Ben.

226
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,473
He's a baby, not a bomb.

227
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,347
Hold him like you'd hold a football.

228
00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:20,446
This is how I would hold a football.

229
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,278
Here. Here. There we go.

230
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,421
Sorry, I'm not very good with babies.

231
00:10:25,421 --> 00:10:27,486
I haven't been around them.

232
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,251
I mean, since I was one.

233
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,813
It's all right. No big deal.

234
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:33,263
Really?

235
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:34,833
You'll feel different

236
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,300
when it's our baby.

237
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,336
What?

238
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:38,303
What?

239
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,398
You think about stuff like that?

240
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,475
Yeah.

241
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,910
Actually, I kind of think

242
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,310
that we'll have two babies.

243
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:52,312
Two babies?

244
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:54,376
You know, a boy and a girl.

245
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,904
Hopefully, the girl will come first,

246
00:10:56,904 --> 00:10:59,321
so Ben won't feel competitive.

247
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,359
Then what's gonna happen?

248
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,925
We won't wanna raise kids in the city,

249
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:07,422
so we'll move to Scarsdale.

250
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,367
It's far enough from our parents

251
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:13,401
not to see them but close enough

253
00:11:13,401 --> 00:11:14,464
for them to babysit.

254
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,289
And yes, I know the taxes are

255
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:22,347
a little higher than Nassau County but the school system's great.

257
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:27,247
Wow, that's great! Great!

258
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,902
Okay, you know what?

259
00:11:29,902 --> 00:11:32,251
I'm off my break now.

260
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,485
Here. You take this.

261
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,927
I'm gonna go pour

262
00:11:38,927 --> 00:11:40,491
these very nice people some coffee.

263
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,918
Look at that. I don't have a pot.

264
00:11:43,918 --> 00:11:46,369
Maybe I've got one at home.

265
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:47,871
Or in Scarsdale.

266
00:11:47,871 --> 00:11:49,270
Hey, is that a door?

267
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:57,965
Hey.

268
00:11:57,965 --> 00:11:59,415
Hey, Pheebs. What's happening?

269
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,868
Murder, cancer, soccer teams

270
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:04,251
eating each other in the Andes.

271
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:06,391
I was really just making small talk.

272
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:08,359
Well, I was just venting.

273
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,355
So you watched the movies?

274
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,263
What is happening to the world?

275
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:20,439
I mean, because E.T. leaves and Rocky loses. Charlotte dies.

277
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,373
Charlotte who?

278
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,341
With the web. The spider.

279
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:26,241
She has babies and dies.

280
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,358
It's like, ''Welcome home

281
00:12:28,358 --> 00:12:30,371
from the hospital.'' Thud!

282
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,278
You wanna feel better?

283
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:33,273
Yeah.

284
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:38,288
Here. Watch this.

285
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:39,420
It's a Wonderful Life.

286
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,483
I've heard of this.

287
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,373
You can't lose.

288
00:12:42,373 --> 00:12:43,453
It's there in the title.

289
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,457
Wonderfulness is baked in.

290
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:46,980
I thought so with

291
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,396
The Pride of the Yankees.

292
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,385
I thought it was about Yankee pride,

293
00:12:51,385 --> 00:12:54,303
and the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease.

294
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,857
The guy was Lou Gehrig.

295
00:12:57,857 --> 00:13:00,240
Didn't you kind of see it coming?

296
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,812
Watch that. It'll restore

297
00:13:03,812 --> 00:13:05,410
all your faith in humanity.

298
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,351
Hey, big guy. Game time.

299
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,886
Hey! Be right there!

300
00:13:08,886 --> 00:13:10,353
There's a game?

301
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,322
I just got my Pik-Up Stiks

302
00:13:12,322 --> 00:13:14,222
back from the shop.

303
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:17,422
Bring your nerves of steel.

304
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,333
It's the basketball playoffs.

305
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,833
I appreciate this, but you don't

306
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,233
have to hang out with them for me.

307
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,430
They have each other.

308
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,265
Oh, no, honey. Don't worry.

309
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:32,338
I like hanging out with them.

310
00:13:32,338 --> 00:13:34,334
They're not like my other friends.

311
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,814
They don't start sentences with,

312
00:13:36,814 --> 00:13:39,248
''Guess who just died shoveling snow?''

313
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:40,901
All right, that's great.

314
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:42,351
Then just go.

315
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,353
Go Knicks!

316
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,290
It's the college playoffs.

317
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,421
Then, go Vassar!

318
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:48,484
They're not in it.

319
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:49,875
Okay, then just go.

320
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:50,489
Okay.

321
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,267
Why does this bother me?

322
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,801
I'm not one of those people who wants

323
00:13:57,801 --> 00:14:00,235
to spend 24 hours a day together.

324
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,295
Sure.

325
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:02,920
He just doesn't have much free time.

326
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,433
What do I do?

327
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,725
Does it matter? You'll ultimately die,

328
00:14:07,725 --> 00:14:10,239
divorce or blow your pet's head off.

329
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,208
Me too!

330
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:15,834
I got a question.

331
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:17,415
Richard made plans with the guys--

332
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,424
Ross made plans for the century.

333
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:22,239
I'm gonna go read Cosmo.

334
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:24,252
Maybe there's something helpful in it.

335
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,781
If not, I can learn how to do

336
00:14:26,781 --> 00:14:29,232
a bikini wax with Christmas candles.

337
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:34,263
What happened back there?

338
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,887
You tell me.

339
00:14:35,887 --> 00:14:37,434
One minute I'm holding Ben.

340
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,909
Then I have two kids and live in

341
00:14:39,909 --> 00:14:42,275
Scarsdale, complaining about taxes!

342
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:43,411
Well, I'm sorry.

343
00:14:43,411 --> 00:14:44,474
I think about stuff.

344
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:46,882
You're at work, assembling bones.

345
00:14:46,882 --> 00:14:48,480
Your mind wanders.

346
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,853
You planned ahead 20 years.

347
00:14:50,853 --> 00:14:52,451
We've dated for six weeks!

348
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,550
You never think about our future?

349
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,790
I think about whose apartment

350
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:00,298
we'll sleep at and where we'll have dinner!

352
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,299
I do not think about

353
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:04,199
our children's names!

354
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,270
You know what our children's names

355
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,204
are gonna be?

356
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,322
No. I mean, I read a book,

357
00:15:10,322 --> 00:15:12,404
and there was a girl named Emily.

358
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:15,504
And I thought that might be good.

359
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,410
What was the book?

360
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,220
The Big Book of Children's Names.

361
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,448
Okay, Ross. Listen.

362
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,418
What we have is amazing.

363
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,908
But I do not want everything

364
00:15:27,908 --> 00:15:29,358
decided for me!

365
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,845
I spent my whole life like that.

366
00:15:31,845 --> 00:15:34,262
That's the reason I left Barry.

367
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,324
I like not knowing right now.

368
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:38,398
Sorry if that scares you,

369
00:15:38,398 --> 00:15:40,428
but if you want me, deal with that!

370
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:41,422
Okay, fine!

371
00:15:41,422 --> 00:15:42,372
Thank you!

372
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,908
We're not done!

373
00:15:43,908 --> 00:15:45,375
I didn't know that.

374
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,440
You're with a guy who won't stop

375
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,436
planning his future with you.

376
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:51,448
He knows we'll be together.

377
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,747
If that scares you, tough!

378
00:15:53,747 --> 00:15:55,243
Deal with that.

379
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,349
I will!

380
00:15:56,349 --> 00:15:57,344
Good, because I love you!

381
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,254
Oh, yeah? I love you too!

382
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,326
That's the first time we said it!

383
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:02,809
I'm gonna kiss you!

384
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:04,225
You better!

385
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,397
Thanks for the movie.

386
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,423
Did you like it?

387
00:16:14,423 --> 00:16:15,407
Oh, yeah.

388
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,755
Was I happier when George

389
00:16:17,755 --> 00:16:21,908
destroyed the business or Donna Reed cried or when

391
00:16:21,908 --> 00:16:24,405
the pharmacist made his ear bleed?

392
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,813
I'll give you that,

393
00:16:26,813 --> 00:16:28,309
but wasn't the ending great?

394
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,805
I was too depressed to watch it.

395
00:16:30,805 --> 00:16:33,256
It should've been called:

396
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,822
It's a Sucky Life, and Just When You

397
00:16:35,822 --> 00:16:38,319
Think It Can't Suck Anymore, It Does!

398
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:43,325
Kick, save! And denied!

400
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,783
He gets it back.

401
00:16:45,783 --> 00:16:47,330
Pass to the middle, lines it up....

402
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,436
Yes! Could that shot be any prettier?

403
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,859
Man, you are incredible.

404
00:16:54,859 --> 00:16:56,440
We had a table in college.

405
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,733
I didn't know they had foosball

406
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:00,217
in the 1800s.

407
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,285
Nice mustache. When puberty hits,

408
00:17:03,285 --> 00:17:05,384
that thing will really kick in.

409
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,826
Not to sound too Florence Henderson,

410
00:17:10,826 --> 00:17:12,424
but dinner's ready.

411
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,187
One more point.

412
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:18,328
Score!

413
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,331
Now can we go?

414
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,300
That's why we don't let her play.

415
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,243
Is everything all right?

416
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:31,815
Don't be mad at him.

417
00:17:31,815 --> 00:17:33,214
It's our fault.

418
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,300
Sorry we're hogging his time.

419
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,348
He's just great to hang out with.

420
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,350
We were just talking about this.

421
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:43,418
He is so much cooler than our dads.

422
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:46,911
Our dads are okay and all,

423
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:48,458
but Richard is just--

424
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,259
What are you kicking me for?

425
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,296
I'm trying to talk here.

426
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,443
You guys see me as a dad?

427
00:17:58,477 --> 00:17:59,444
Oh, yeah!

428
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:00,411
No!

429
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,409
No.

430
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,346
You're clearly not familiar

431
00:18:06,346 --> 00:18:08,376
with our young persons' vernacular.

432
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:12,214
When we say ''dad,'' we mean ''buddy.''

433
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,419
We mean ''pal.''

434
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,424
No, seriously. Joey's my dad.

435
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:22,300
Monica's my dad.

436
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,403
I've even got some dads down at work.

437
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:27,294
That's fine.

438
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,369
Well, your other dad and I are gonna

439
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:31,399
go have a romantic evening.

440
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,434
I'll just see you kids around.

441
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:35,338
Nighty-night.

442
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,245
You're not a dad!

443
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:39,463
I can't believe you got us

444
00:18:39,463 --> 00:18:40,509
into trouble.

445
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,830
So are you okay?

446
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,326
Yeah.

447
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,298
Just I feel like I'm about 100.

449
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,402
I thought I was just one of the guys.

450
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,369
Come here.

451
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,243
I'll make you feel like

452
00:19:09,243 --> 00:19:10,306
one of the guys.

453
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,300
For a really cool guy,

454
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,279
you suck at foosball.

455
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,293
What? I was killing them.

456
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,419
Yeah, well they suck too.

457
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,798
Take the poopy diaper

458
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:31,396
and put it in the poopy diaper pail.

459
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:34,320
Calling it a poopy diaper

460
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,204
doesn't make this process any cuter.

461
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:39,923
Hello?

462
00:19:39,923 --> 00:19:40,435
-It's us.

463
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:42,310
Come on up.

464
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,407
I'll get his stuff together.

465
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:44,944
Okay, we can do this now,

466
00:19:44,944 --> 00:19:46,440
can't we, Ben?

467
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,315
Yes, we can.

468
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:51,311
Yes, we can.

469
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:54,254
There! I did it!

470
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,419
I did it!

471
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,363
Look at that!

472
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:02,257
It stays on and everything.

473
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:03,850
Hi!

474
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,266
Hi.

475
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:10,855
I'm sorry. What did you just say?

476
00:20:10,855 --> 00:20:12,436
Did you just say hi?

477
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:14,741
Oh, my God! Ross?

478
00:20:14,741 --> 00:20:16,237
Ben just said hi!

479
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:17,864
Ben just said hi!

480
00:20:17,864 --> 00:20:19,280
The word ''hi''?

481
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,285
No, my Uncle Hi.

482
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,850
Great, I missed that too!

483
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,346
I miss everything!

484
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,369
Oh, I'm sorry. I guess I just

485
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:29,348
bring it out in him.

486
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:30,927
Hello! Where is he?

487
00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:32,360
We missed you.

488
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,331
We missed you so much!

489
00:20:34,331 --> 00:20:36,265
Come here, Ben.

490
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:37,864
Guess what?

491
00:20:37,864 --> 00:20:39,360
Ben just said his first word.

492
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:40,938
What did he say?

493
00:20:40,938 --> 00:20:42,405
Something about, ''Hi.''

494
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,440
That's so exciting!

495
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,305
Mommy's so proud of you!

496
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,329
Hi!

497
00:20:48,329 --> 00:20:49,279
Hi?

498
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:50,977
You know, actually,

499
00:20:50,977 --> 00:20:52,473
it's more like, ''Hi!''

500
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,357
This could go on for a while.

501
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:01,325
Yeah, we've got a cab waiting.

502
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,326
Well, this was fun.

503
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,341
We should do it again sometime, Ben.

504
00:21:05,341 --> 00:21:07,320
What do you say?

505
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:08,916
All right, so I've got him...?

506
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,366
Tuesday.

507
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:11,464
Bye, you guys.

508
00:21:11,464 --> 00:21:12,459
Take care.

509
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:14,233
Bye, Ben.

510
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:15,228
Bye.

511
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,807
Did he just say bye?

512
00:21:19,807 --> 00:21:21,371
He said bye!

513
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,879
You said bye!

514
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:24,278
He said bye to me!

515
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,475
Yes, he did!

516
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,866
Suddenly I'm seeing him

517
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:29,447
go off to college!

518
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,018
We've gotta go.

519
00:21:31,018 --> 00:21:32,548
We've got that cab downstairs.

520
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,255
See you later.

521
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,289
Bye!

522
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:37,284
Bye.

523
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,310
Look at this nice deep hole I dug.

524
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,315
Hey, Bert, isn't this a nice hole?

525
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:01,866
This is the part where Ernie buries

526
00:22:01,866 --> 00:22:04,448
Bert in the sand and can't find him.

527
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,372
I've looked ahead on the tape,

528
00:22:07,372 --> 00:22:09,420
and he does find him again.

529
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,280
But before that happens,

530
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,231
there's some rough going.

531
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,324
But I think we can handle it.

532
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,932
And there's just the alphabet,

533
00:22:18,932 --> 00:22:21,429
but we know that ends well, so....

534
00:22:22,274 --> 00:22:23,468
Here we go.

535
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,335
Bert? Bert?

536
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:28,445
What happened to Bert?

537
00:22:28,445 --> 00:22:30,345
He was here a moment ago.

538
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,474
Oh, no! My old friend Bert is lost.

539
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,479
I'm so glad you're here.
