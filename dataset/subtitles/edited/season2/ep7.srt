1
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:05,427
Okay, what is it about me? Do I not look fun?

2
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:09,470
Is there something repellent about me?

3
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:11,267
How was the party?

4
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:15,440
It couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me.

5
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:17,477
Am I hideously unattractive?

6
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:21,252
No, you are not. You are very attractive.

7
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,254
I do the same thing.

8
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:27,453
When I put on a little weight, I question everything.

9
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:33,261
I've put on weight?

10
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,357
Did you want to...?

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,464
No, not weight. More like insulation.

12
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,310
I'm unemployed, in need of a project.

13
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,505
Wanna work out? I can remake you.

14
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:51,409
That might get in the way of my lying-around time.

15
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:53,781
Please?

16
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:55,277
Come on, let her do it!

17
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,320
All right.

18
00:00:56,423 --> 00:01:00,359
But if my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm going home.

19
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:05,459
Your boobs are fine. I never should have said anything. Come here.

20
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:11,461
Can't make hands meet!

21
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,452
Let's do it!

22
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,423
What?

23
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:20,262
Just never seen your little stretchy pants before.

24
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,435
It's cute.

25
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,274
And we're changing.

26
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,451
Come on, give me five more!

27
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,462
Five more!

28
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:47,493
Five more and I'll flash you.

29
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:55,273
One...two...two and a half.

32
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,501
Just show me one of them.

33
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:18,259
She's insane. The woman's insane.

34
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,526
Before work, after work, during work.

35
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,361
She's got me doing butt-clenches at my desk.

36
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:27,429
Now they won't bring me my mail anymore.

37
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,365
Tell her to stop.

38
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:32,467
No, while she's unemployed I'm all she's got.

39
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,477
Why don't we all pitch in and buy her a restaurant?

40
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,452
How'd it go with Scott?

41
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:46,348
It was nice. Went to a romantic restaurant ordered champagne. Nice.

43
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,807
He still won't put out?

44
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:50,354
Nope. Zilch. Nothing.

45
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,457
Sorry, Pheebs.

46
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,459
I don't mind taking it slow. I like him a lot.

47
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,239
He's interesting, and he's really sweet.

48
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,240
Why won't he give it up?

49
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:06,403
Maybe he drives on the other side of the road.

50
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,210
If you know what I mean.

51
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,418
No. What do you mean? He's not British.

52
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,321
Maybe he's gay.

53
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,450
I don't think that's it.

54
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:31,235
We went dancing the other night and the way he held me and looked into my eyes I definitely felt something.

57
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,430
How much can you tell from a look?

58
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,465
No, I felt it on my hip. I could tell.

59
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,246
Yo, Bing! Racquetball in 20 minutes.

60
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,446
Joey, be a pal. Lift my hand and smack her with it.

61
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,921
Oh, Rachel! Don't look.

62
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:51,354
What?

63
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,487
I don't care. I have a date tonight.

64
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:58,412
You have a date?

65
00:04:58,412 --> 00:04:59,561
Monica's setting me up.

66
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,424
What about Ross and....

67
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,295
My whole insane jealousy thing?

68
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:10,401
Well, as much fun as that was I've decided to opt for sanity.

70
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,505
You're okay about this?

71
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,305
Oh, yeah, come on! I'm moving on.

72
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:19,317
He can press her up against that window all he wants.

73
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:23,446
For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing.

74
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,253
Hi, guys.

75
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,353
Monica, I'll come by and pick up Fluffy's old cat toys.

76
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,323
Only if you say his full name.

77
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:39,271
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toys?

78
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:40,471
All right.

79
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,253
You're getting a cat?

80
00:05:43,253 --> 00:05:45,232
Actually, we're getting a cat.

81
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,241
Together?

82
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,338
Both of you? Together?

83
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:53,250
It'll live with each of us half the time.

84
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:56,355
Well, isn't that just lovely?

85
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:02,223
That's something you'll enjoy for a really, really long time.

87
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,195
Hopefully.

88
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:07,323
Look at that. I gotta go! I got a date!

89
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,231
With a man.

90
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:16,431
You guys have a really good night and you two have a really good cat.

92
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,511
We're not supposed to take these when we leave.

93
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:35,350
Monica might've mentioned that this is my first date since my divorce.

94
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,323
If I seem a little nervous, I am.

95
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,426
How long do cats live?

96
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:44,953
I'm sorry?

97
00:06:44,953 --> 00:06:46,437
Cats. How long do they live?

98
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,471
Figuring you don't throw them under a bus, or something.

99
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,957
Maybe 1 5, 1 6 years.

100
00:06:53,957 --> 00:06:56,437
Well, that's just great.

101
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,347
Cheers!

102
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,282
Right. Clink.

103
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:12,186
Monica told you I was cuter than this, didn't she?

104
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,323
No, Michael, it's not you.

105
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:18,336
Sorry. It's this thing.

106
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:24,408
It's not as bad as it sounds but my friend is getting a cat with his girlfriend.

108
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,345
Oh, that does sound....

109
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,208
He just started going out with her.

110
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,447
Is this guy an old boyfriend?

111
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,517
Yeah, he wishes.

112
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,263
I'm sorry. Look at me.

113
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,282
Michael, let's talk about you.

114
00:07:47,282 --> 00:07:49,233
All right.

115
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,235
Okay.

116
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,235
So....

117
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,367
Did you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?

118
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:00,861
So I figured it out.

119
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:02,277
What?

120
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:05,179
Why Scott won't sleep with me.

121
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,377
I'm not sexy enough.

122
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,479
Phoebe, that's crazy.

123
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,418
When I first met you, know what I said?

124
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:16,218
I said, ''Excellent butt, great rack.''

125
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:22,233
Really? That's so sweet.

126
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:27,395
I mean, I'm officially offended. But that's so sweet.

127
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:32,471
If you wanna know what the deal is, you have to ask him.

128
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,214
You're right. You're right.

129
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,407
You are so yum!

130
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:01,206
I mean, it's a cat, you know? It's a cat.

131
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,175
Why can't they get a bug? Those fruit flies.

132
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:10,273
Those things that live for a day. What are they called?

133
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,396
Fruit flies?

134
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:13,408
Yes!

135
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,278
Thank you.

136
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,272
Would you like dessert?

137
00:09:17,272 --> 00:09:19,223
No! No dessert.

138
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,385
Just the check. Please.

139
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,320
Oh, no. You're not having fun, are you?

140
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,229
No, no, I am.

141
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:33,203
But only because I've been playing the movie Diner in my head.

142
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:35,332
Oh, look at me.

143
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:36,499
Look at me.

144
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,440
I'm on a date with a really great guy.

145
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:47,409
All I can think about is Ross, and his cat and his Julie.

147
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,221
Look, do you want a piece of pie?

148
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,315
No!

149
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,456
Too late for that, man. I've screwed this all up.

150
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:02,359
I just want to get over him. Why can't I do that?

151
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,329
I've been through a divorce. Trust me, you'll be fine.

152
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,275
You just haven't had any closure.

153
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,276
Closure!

154
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,438
That's it! That's what I need!

155
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,449
God, you're brilliant!

156
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:24,354
Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?

157
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:28,556
Well, there's no one way, really.

158
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,287
Whatever it takes so that you can say to him:

159
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,389
''I'm over you.''

160
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,393
Over you.

161
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,402
That's what it is.

162
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,303
Closure.

163
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,367
Hello? Excuse me?

164
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,410
Excuse me. Hel--

165
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:47,892
Hang on.

166
00:10:47,892 --> 00:10:48,404
Excuse me?

167
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,431
What?

168
00:10:49,431 --> 00:10:50,381
Hi. I'm sorry.

169
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,577
I need to borrow your phone for one minute.

170
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,379
I'm talking.

171
00:10:56,422 --> 00:11:01,325
One phone call, I'll be very quick. I'll even pay for it myself.

172
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:06,228
You're being a little weird about your phone.

173
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,326
I'll call you back.

174
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,339
Thank you.

175
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,339
I'm so good with people.

176
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,246
Machine.

177
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:26,901
Just waiting for the beep.

178
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:28,351
Good.

179
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:32,482
Ross! Hi, it's Rachel.

180
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:39,463
I'm just calling to say that everything's fine, and I'm really happy for you.

182
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,267
And your cat.

183
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:46,462
Who, by the way, I think you should name Michael.

184
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:55,405
See, I'm thinking of names so obviously I am over you.

186
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:58,506
I am over you.

187
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:04,255
And that, my friend, is what they call ''closure.''

188
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:21,329
No, no, no no, no, no!

190
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:25,434
It's Sunday. I'm not running on a Sunday.

191
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,928
Why not?

192
00:12:26,928 --> 00:12:28,378
Because it's Sunday!

193
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,476
It's God's day.

194
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:35,444
If you say stop, then we stop.

195
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,277
Stop.

196
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:41,452
Come on, we can't stop! We got three more pounds to go!

197
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:45,294
I am the energy train and you are onboard!

198
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,438
Hey, Rach.

199
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,341
And how was the date?

200
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,353
I think there was a restaurant.

201
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,349
I know there was wine.

202
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,451
Well, actually, Julie's getting a cab.

203
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:20,255
I just need the cat toys. Did Monica say....

204
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:23,233
Why are you looking at me like that?

205
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,426
I'm sorry. I don't know, I....

206
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:31,341
I think I had a dream about you but I don't remember.

208
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,472
Okay.

209
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,238
There they are.

210
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,474
Did you call me last night?

211
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:43,449
No. I stayed at Julie's last night.

212
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:48,292
I haven't been home yet. Can I check my messages?

213
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,294
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

214
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,564
Rach, I got a message from you!

215
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,270
Who's Michael?

216
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,333
Oh, my God!

217
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:06,434
Hang up the phone. Give me the phone!

218
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,339
Give me the--

219
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,323
You're over me?

220
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,415
Oh, God!

221
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:22,222
You're--

222
00:14:22,222 --> 00:14:23,217
Oh, God.

223
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,263
You're over me?

224
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:35,331
When were you under me?

226
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,269
Rach.

227
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,244
Rachel, do you...?

228
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,382
I mean, were you?

229
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,314
What?

230
00:14:46,314 --> 00:14:47,377
Okay, okay.

231
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:53,257
Basically, lately, I've....

232
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,452
I've sort of had feelings for you.

233
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,326
You've had feelings for me?

234
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,429
So? You had feelings for me first!

235
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,343
You know about my-- You know I had--

236
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,243
You know?

237
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,466
Chandler told me.

238
00:15:18,466 --> 00:15:20,417
When did he? When did he?

239
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,313
When you were in China.

240
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,325
Meeting Julie.

241
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:30,328
Julie. That's-- Oh, God!

242
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,262
I need to lie down.

243
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:42,264
No, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand and I'm gonna walk. I'm walking and standing.

245
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:45,343
So you-- And now, now....

246
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,472
Now you're over me?

247
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:53,283
Are you over me?

248
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,194
That's Julie.

249
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,393
-Hi, Julie.
-I've got a cab waiting.

250
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,298
I'll be right down!

251
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,305
Wait, so you're going?

252
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:20,242
Well, I have to. I can't deal with this right now.

253
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:24,339
I mean, I've got a cab. I've got a girlfriend.

254
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,214
I'm gonna go get a cat.

255
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:31,446
Cat!

256
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,435
Hey, Joey.

257
00:16:49,435 --> 00:16:50,430
Hey, Pheebs.

258
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:56,337
How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?

259
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:59,444
I can't find the remote.

260
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,379
Thank you.

261
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:08,387
Scott asked me to come over for lunch and I did.

262
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,388
And we did.

263
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,743
All right! Way to go!

264
00:17:12,743 --> 00:17:14,290
Yay, me!

265
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,196
So how did it happen?

266
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:20,238
I finally asked him what was going on.

267
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:21,329
What did he say?

268
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,343
He understands how sex can be very emotional for a woman.

269
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:29,210
He was afraid that I was going to get all:

270
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:32,411
''Will he call me the next day? Where is this going?''

271
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:39,417
He said he wanted to hold off until he was ready to be serious.

272
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:40,737
Wow.

273
00:17:40,737 --> 00:17:41,249
Yeah.

274
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:45,228
So I said, ''Okay. Relax, please.''

275
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:50,425
Sex can be just about two people in the moment.

276
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:54,462
If he wants to see me again, he can call. If not, fine.

277
00:17:55,307 --> 00:18:02,472
So after a lot of talking I convinced him.

279
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:11,222
Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him.

280
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:15,225
He got you to say he never has to call you again.

281
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:19,196
And he got you thinking this is a great idea?

282
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,294
This man is my God!

283
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,345
Oh, this one's cute.

284
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,415
Yeah, and this one, and that one.

285
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:41,442
They're all cute. They're kittens. Just wrap one up.

286
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,371
You okay?

287
00:18:43,371 --> 00:18:44,321
Yeah, me?

288
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:47,325
Yeah, yeah. Yeah?

289
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,420
Ross, honey. Hey.

290
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:55,365
I know this is a big step, but I think we'll be okay.

291
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,329
Yeah, I know. I know.

292
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:04,171
So do you have any cats that are really old or incredibly sick?

293
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,178
I don't want one that's about to die.

294
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:13,173
We should've worked that out before we came down here.

295
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,274
Okay, sweetie.

296
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:20,220
I'll narrow it down to this one here and this one with the stripes.

298
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,316
You pick.

299
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,224
Whoa, hey, I have to pick?

300
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,321
Yeah, whichever one you want.

301
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,391
Well, I don't know.

302
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:33,199
It's not that easy to choose.

303
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:41,335
Both cats are beautiful...and funny.

305
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:47,343
I'm sure I'd be happy with either cat.

306
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:49,800
Well, do you want to take both?

307
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,347
Both? Both!?

308
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:55,256
I can't have two cats!

309
00:19:56,361 --> 00:20:00,229
Joey's the kind of guys who could have two cats.

310
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,533
Goodnight, Gunther.

311
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,810
Hi.

312
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,374
I didn't get a cat.

313
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,475
Oh, that's interesting.

314
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:26,247
No, it's not interesting. It's very not interesting.

315
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,283
It's actually 100% the opposite of interesting.

316
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,453
I got it, Ross.

317
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:34,454
You had no right to tell me you had feelings for me.

318
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:37,400
I was doing great before I knew!

319
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,403
I was doing great too!

320
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:42,302
It's hard to see you with Julie.

321
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,365
You should've said so before!

322
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:47,570
I didn't know! How come you never said anything?

323
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:49,507
There wasn't a good time.

324
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,376
You had a year. And we only hung out every night!

325
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:57,512
Not every night.

327
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:02,257
It's not like I didn't try. Things got in the way.

328
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:09,357
Like Italian guys, or ex-fiancés or Italian guys.

330
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:15,238
There was one Italian guy. Do you have a point?

331
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,243
The point is, I don't need this now!

332
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,245
Okay? It's too late.

333
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,271
I'm with someone else. This ship has sailed!

334
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,374
You're gonna put away your feelings for me?

335
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,352
I've done it since ninth grade.

336
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,255
All right. Go ahead and do that.

337
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,371
I don't need your ship!

338
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:34,451
Good!

339
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,287
And you know what? Now I got closure!

340
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,381
Try the bottom one.

341
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,307
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.

342
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,249
We're not working out. It's over.

343
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:10,250
With one pound to go? Come on!

344
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:14,257
We're working, we're moving, we're grooving!

345
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,318
I don't mind the last pound.

346
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:20,263
In fact, I kind of like the last pound.

347
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:24,234
Don't make me do anything I'll regret.

348
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:27,437
What you gonna do, fat boy?

349
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,429
What?

350
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:36,244
Nothing. Except say it's wonderful how much energy you have.

351
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,246
Well, thanks.

352
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,478
Especially with how tough it's been to find work.

353
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,355
Well, you know....

354
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:51,389
You can't tell your parents you were fired, because they'd be disappointed.

355
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:58,368
It's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.

356
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:00,396
Well, no, but I....

357
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:06,233
If it were me, I'd have difficulty getting out of bed at all.

358
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,411
You know, I try to stay positive.

359
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:19,313
So you feel like going for a run?

361
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,224
All right.

362
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:28,324
Because you don't have to. You could just take a nap right here.

363
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:31,425
Okay.

364
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,820
Just for a little while.

365
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,270
Okay.
