1
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,430
Ross kissed me.

2
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:09,271
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

3
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,793
It was unbelievable.

4
00:00:11,793 --> 00:00:14,244
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

5
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:18,340
Let's hear everything. Get the wine and unplug the phone.

6
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:22,285
Does this end well or do we need to get tissues?

7
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,448
It ended very well.

8
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:29,292
Do not start without me! Do not start without me!

9
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:34,356
Let's hear about the kiss. Was it a soft brush against your lips?

10
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:38,269
Or was it a ''I gotta have you now'' kind of thing?

11
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:42,398
At first it was really intense, you know? And then....

12
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:46,309
Oh, God. And then we just sort of sunk into it.

13
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:50,281
Was he holding you? Or were his hands on your back?

14
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:57,518
No, actually, first they started out on my waist then they slid up and they were in my hair.

16
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,443
And then I kissed her.

17
00:01:01,443 --> 00:01:03,360
Tongue?

18
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,442
Yeah.

19
00:01:04,442 --> 00:01:05,454
Cool.

20
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,573
All right, check out this bad boy.

21
00:01:55,315 --> 00:02:04,254
1 2 megabytes of RAM, 500-megabyte hard drive, spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 bps.

23
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,450
What are you gonna use it for?

24
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,455
Games and stuff.

25
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,365
There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.

26
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,424
Oh, wait, here's one.

27
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,284
Are you willing to cook naked?

28
00:02:18,284 --> 00:02:20,332
There's an ad for a naked chef?

29
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:25,333
No. But if you'll cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked.

30
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,436
And then....

31
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,352
So, how'd you make out last night?

32
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:40,449
That's funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait, wait.

33
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,354
Yeah, that's just painful.

34
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:46,456
Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.

35
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:54,498
It was. But I get home and I see Julie's saline solution on my table and I think, ''What am I doing?''

37
00:02:55,275 --> 00:03:03,246
Here I am with Julie, this incredible woman, who I care about and cares about me and I'm throwing it all away?

39
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,443
You got all that from saline solution?

40
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:12,452
I'm the same way. Show me a bottle of Visine and I'm like, ''Who am I?''

41
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:17,226
Wait. We're talking about Rachel. You and Rachel.

42
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:22,267
I've dreamed of me and Rachel for 10 years, but now I'm with Julie.

43
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,270
It's like, me and Julie, me and Rachel.

44
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,362
Me and Julie, me and Rach--

45
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,332
Rachel. Rachel.

46
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:31,438
Hey, you.

47
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:32,433
How are you?

48
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,041
Good. How are you?

49
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,537
Good.

50
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,328
Hi, honey.

51
00:03:37,328 --> 00:03:38,374
Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie?

52
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:40,344
Julie!

53
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,285
How are you?

54
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:43,919
Good.

55
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,482
Good.

56
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,351
So everybody's here.

57
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,485
Everybody's good.

58
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,558
Good and great and here.

59
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:57,265
Were you gonna play something?

60
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,382
Well, actually--

61
00:03:58,382 --> 00:03:59,394
Play it.

62
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,399
All right.

63
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,824
Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.

64
00:04:04,824 --> 00:04:06,405
What?

65
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,408
Okay. Hi.

66
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,343
Hello. Hi. Okay.

67
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:20,451
This is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up.

69
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:27,322
It's called ''Two of Them Kissed Last Night.''

70
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:33,269
There was a girl We'll call her Betty

71
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:36,433
And a guy Let's call him Neil

72
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:41,336
Now I can't stress This point too strongly

73
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:44,373
This story isn't real

74
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:51,446
Now our Neil must decide Who will be the girl he casts aside?

75
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,392
Will Betty be the one Who he loves truly?

76
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,487
Or will it be the one Who we'll call Loolie?

77
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,394
He must decide He must decide

78
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:08,237
Even though I made him up He must decide

79
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:16,204
Well, this is a nice rÃ©sumÃ©. Nice, nice, nice.

80
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,408
Muy impressivo.

81
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,253
Shame none of it's true.

82
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,314
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

83
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:29,452
No, it's all true. Just a little nervous, that's all. I'm fine now.

84
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:35,257
Mr. Rastatter, what does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear.

85
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,785
Mockolate.

86
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:38,235
I'm sorry?

87
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:42,332
Mockolate. It's a synthetic chocolate substitute.

88
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:49,337
Go ahead, try a piece. We think Mockolate is better than chocolate.

89
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,350
All right.

90
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,188
I love how it crumbles.

91
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,893
Chocolate doesn't do that.

92
00:06:03,893 --> 00:06:05,491
No, ma'am.

93
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:10,326
We should be getting our FDA approval any day now.

94
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,301
Hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving.

95
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:21,211
The way we see it, chocolate dominates your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas.

97
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:27,308
Given the right marketing we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday.

99
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,409
Wow.

100
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,448
Aren't you gonna swallow that?

101
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,419
Waiting for it to stop bubbling.

102
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,429
Yeah. Isn't that great?

103
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:43,424
Anyhow, we're looking for chefs who can create Thanksgiving recipes.

104
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,261
You interested?

105
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,465
Absolutely.

106
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:55,439
I love creating new recipes and Thanksgiving. And now I love Mockolate.

107
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,238
Really?

108
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:02,380
Especially the aftertaste. I tell you that'll last you till Christmas.

110
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,226
How about Mockolate mousse?

111
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,386
It's not very Thanksgiving-y.

112
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,393
How about Pilgrim Mockolate mousse?

113
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,427
What makes it Pilgrim?

114
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,328
We'll put buckles on it.

115
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,308
Did Ross call?

116
00:07:24,308 --> 00:07:26,208
No, I'm sorry.

117
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:30,238
Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he?

118
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:34,446
He'll stay with her and she'll be, ''Hi, I'm Julie. Ross picked me.

119
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:39,452
We'll get married and have kids and dig up stuff together!''

120
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:44,458
No offense, but that sounds nothing like her.

121
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:50,358
What am I gonna do? This is like a complete nightmare.

122
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:55,430
I know. This must be so hard. ''Oh, no. Two women love me.

123
00:07:56,242 --> 00:08:02,380
They're both gorgeous, my wallet's too small for my 50s and my diamond shoes are too tight.''

125
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,378
Here's a thought--

126
00:08:05,378 --> 00:08:07,374
Don't ever touch the computer.

127
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,290
Ross, listen. I got two words for you:

128
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,290
Threesome.

129
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:22,197
You still have another word, if you wanna use it.

130
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:25,395
Oh, hey. I think I know what it is. Help.

131
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,503
Let's get logical about this. Make a list.

132
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,302
Rachel and Julie: Pros and Cons.

133
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,340
We'll put their names in different fonts.

134
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,318
I can use colors for each column.

135
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,305
Can't we just use a pen?

136
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:45,256
No, Amish boy.

137
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:51,429
Let's start with the cons because they're more fun. Rachel first.

138
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,366
I don't know. I mean....

139
00:08:55,468 --> 00:09:00,269
All right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.

140
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,397
You could say that.

141
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:08,270
I guess, sometimes she's a little ditsy, you know?

142
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:12,182
And I've seen her be a little too into her looks.

143
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:17,279
Julie and I have a lot in common because we're both paleontologists.

144
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,381
Rachel's just a waitress.

145
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,222
Waitress.

146
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:24,421
Got it. You guys wanna play Doom?

147
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,200
Or we could keep doing this.

148
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,497
What else?

149
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,500
I don't know.

150
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,504
Oh. Her ankles are a little chubby.

151
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,404
Okay, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?

152
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,412
She's not Rachel.

153
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:53,258
This is pumpkin pie with a Mockolate crust.

154
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:57,228
Mockolate cranberry cake, and Mockolate chip cookies.

155
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,355
Just like the Indians served.

156
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:03,867
Oh, my God.

157
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:05,266
''Oh, my God'' good?

158
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:09,274
Oh, my God, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.

159
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,439
Sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like.

160
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,444
I'm telling you, this thing won't print.

161
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:28,484
Yes, I pressed that button 100 times. For a hot line, you're not so hot.

162
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,253
What's in the background?

163
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,493
Are you watching Star Trek?

164
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,490
So did you break Julie's heart?

165
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,407
Yes.

166
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:50,382
It was horrible. She cried, I cried. She threw things, they hit me.

167
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,382
I did the right thing.

168
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:57,422
So Spock actually hugs his father?

169
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,258
Hey, do you guys have--?

170
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,224
Where you going?

171
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:11,334
I just got back from Julie's.

173
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:16,237
No, no. It's not what you think.

174
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,368
It's the other thing.

175
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:29,284
Well, what's the other thing? What do I think?

176
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,382
Well....

177
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,358
He broke up with Julie.

178
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:38,295
Well, go hug her, for God's sakes.

179
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,277
Really?

180
00:11:40,277 --> 00:11:41,289
Really.

181
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,383
It's always been you, Rach.

182
00:11:44,383 --> 00:11:46,465
Oh, God.

183
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,418
Oh, this is good. This is really good.

184
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,513
I know, I know. It's almost....

185
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:13,262
What do you say we take a walk? Just us. Not them.

186
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:14,845
Let me get my coat.

187
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:16,358
Okay. No, hey.

188
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,268
I'll get your coat.

189
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:28,538
He's going to get my coat, Joey.

190
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:33,375
You guys, I can't believe this. This is unbelievable.

191
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:34,948
What's that?

192
00:12:34,948 --> 00:12:36,444
What? Nothing!

193
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,837
I saw my name. What is it?

194
00:12:39,837 --> 00:12:41,384
No, no. See? See?

195
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,451
Hey, it's printing.

196
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:46,292
Hey, it's printing!

197
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,413
Let me see.

198
00:12:48,413 --> 00:12:50,261
Someone order a coat?

199
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:53,465
He wrote something about me and won't let me see.

200
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,497
He won't? He won't.

201
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:02,311
Because isn't that... the short story you were writing?

202
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:06,316
Yes, it is a short story that I was writing.

203
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,343
I'm in it? Let me read it.

204
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,251
No!

205
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,340
Come on.

206
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,456
Hey, why don't you read it to her?

207
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,335
All right.

208
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,477
''It was summer.

209
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,477
And it was hot.

210
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,549
Rachel was there.

211
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,261
A lonely gray couch.

212
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,365
'Oh, look!' cried Ned.

213
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:59,403
And then the kingdom was his forever. The end.''

214
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:06,235
That's it? You're the worst writer in the world.

215
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,246
This isn't funny anymore.

216
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:12,307
There's something about me on that paper. I want to see it.

217
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,318
No, you don't.

218
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:20,214
All right. If you guys want to be children, that's fine.

219
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,351
I do not need to see it.

220
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:29,930
What is this?

221
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,426
That is....

222
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:33,427
What is this?

223
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:34,905
Thank you.

224
00:14:34,905 --> 00:14:36,338
Good luck.

225
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:42,345
Okay. Just remember how crazy I am about you, okay?

226
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:48,342
''Kind of ditsy''? ''Too into her looks''? ''Spoiled''?

227
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:52,447
That's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type ''little.''

228
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,393
''Just a waitress''?

229
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,486
Now, that was....

230
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,392
I mean, as opposed to....

231
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,199
Okay, is this over yet? Rach?

232
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:09,237
I do not have chubby ankles!

233
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,332
No. I--

234
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,402
Look at the other side. Look at Julie's column.

235
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,347
''She's not Rachem''?

236
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,213
What's a Rachem?

237
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:24,221
A stupid paleontology word I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.

238
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,414
Rach, come on.

239
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:32,423
It's ''She's not Rachel''! She's not....

240
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,233
Rachel?

241
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,432
My diary. Brilliant.

242
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:45,432
If I said it was my diary, she wouldn't have made me read it.

243
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:51,273
True. You'd be a great person to have around after an emergency.

244
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,283
I cannot believe Ross made this list.

245
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:55,870
I know.

246
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,354
What a dinkus.

247
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,282
Cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea.

248
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,224
What?

249
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,389
Oh, good. I was hoping that would come up.

250
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,297
This was your idea?

251
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:12,498
Let's get some perspective here. These things happen for a reason.

252
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,229
Yeah. You.

253
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:20,337
Pheebs, back me up. You believe in that karma crap, don't you?

254
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:25,342
Good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.

255
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,460
Rach.

256
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,431
Open up, please?

257
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:55,337
When somebody does not buzz you in, that means, ''go away'' not, ''climb up the fire escape.''

259
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,416
I want to read you your pro list.

260
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,385
Not interested.

261
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,186
''Number one: the way you cry at game shows.

262
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:09,192
Number two: how much you love your friends.

263
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:13,255
Number three: how you play with your hair when you're nervous.

264
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:17,291
Number four: how brave you are for starting life over.

265
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:20,395
Number five: how great you are with Ben.

266
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,300
Number six: the way you smell.''

267
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,327
What are you doing?

268
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:29,210
Want to open the window?

269
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,441
Oh, yeah.

270
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,214
What are you doing out there?

271
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:37,222
You must be freezing. Know what you need?

272
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:40,419
How about a steaming cup of hot Mockolate?

273
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,456
Come on, open up.

274
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,224
Come on. You gotta give me another chance.

275
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,237
No.

276
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,299
No?

277
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:54,294
That's what I said.

278
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,954
We should go.

279
00:17:55,954 --> 00:17:57,535
You don't have to go. We're done.

280
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,824
I know how you must--

281
00:17:59,824 --> 00:18:01,371
No, you don't, Ross.

282
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:06,183
Imagine the worst things you think about yourself.

283
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:16,384
How would you feel if the person you trusted most in the world not only thinks them but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.

286
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:21,297
No, but see, I want to be with you in spite of all those things.

287
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:26,432
Well, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said, don't go.

288
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,204
You know what?

289
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:39,307
If it were the other way, there is nothing you could put on a list that would make me not wanna be with you.

291
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,512
Well, I guess that's the difference between us.

292
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,450
See, I'd never make a list.

293
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:06,404
I never know how long to wait in this type of situation before you can talk.

294
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,272
Maybe a little longer.

295
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:18,185
In these recipes, the quantities may seem unusual.

296
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,225
Like the coconut Mockolate holiday nut bars?

297
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:27,490
I said four cups of coconut and four of nuts and only one tablespoon of Mockolate.

299
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,263
Doesn't matter.

300
00:19:30,263 --> 00:19:31,292
What?

301
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:37,308
Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.

302
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,778
Gosh, I'm sorry.

303
00:19:40,778 --> 00:19:43,246
Yeah. Anyhow, here's your check.

304
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:47,218
Thank you for all the trouble you went through.

305
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:51,312
You didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?

306
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,221
Well, I ate some.

307
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:56,226
Oh, some is fine. Some is not a lot.

308
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:01,322
So it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?

309
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,376
Is that him again?

310
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:24,354
I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighing me down.

311
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,357
I don't think this is the best time.

312
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,362
Look, can you do something for me?

313
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,397
Sure. What?

314
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,463
All right.

315
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,373
Music?

316
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,273
Sure.

317
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:54,375
The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross.

318
00:20:54,486 --> 00:21:02,221
Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry and he hopes you can forgive him.

320
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:37,351
We've just gotten a call from Rachel and she told us what Ross did.

321
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:43,491
It's appalling. Ross, if you're listening I don't wanna play your song anymore.

323
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:52,275
Let's devote our time to a couple that stands a chance.

324
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:57,474
Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you. She hopes you two will work it out.

325
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,374
Thanks for coming in again.

326
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,353
Not at all. I have no morals. I need cash.

327
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,456
Like I'm looking in a mirror.

328
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:46,492
Anyway, they're called Fish-tachios. They taste exactly like pistachios.

329
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:50,564
But they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits.

330
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,400
Here, try one.

331
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,497
All right.

332
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,790
You're not allergic to anything?

333
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,274
Cat hair.

334
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,468
Oh, sorry.
