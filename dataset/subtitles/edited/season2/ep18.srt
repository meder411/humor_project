1
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:05,430
It's not fair! It's my money.

2
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:08,373
I know. But it's what Brad wanted.

3
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:09,857
Which one is she?

4
00:00:09,857 --> 00:00:11,273
That's Brad's widow.

5
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:12,908
Why is she so upset?

6
00:00:12,908 --> 00:00:14,438
She was cut out of the will.

7
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:18,342
Doesn't she know you can't define yourself by money?

8
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:23,550
It's about values and morals and your ability to give and receive love.

9
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,450
No.

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,351
-Oh, Drake.
-I'm sorry, Amber.

11
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:32,456
It's just like Brad to have to have the last word.

12
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,382
Sorry I'm late. What happened?

13
00:00:34,382 --> 00:00:36,265
We wanna see the end.

14
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,270
-I want you, Drake.
-I know you do.

15
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,499
But we can never be together that way.

16
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,264
What?

17
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:48,370
There's something I never told you. I'm actually your half-brother.

18
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,317
So, what happens next?

19
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:58,516
I get a medical award for separating Siamese twins.

20
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:08,323
Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramon where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big.

22
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,369
But it's cursed.

23
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,233
So cool!

24
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:15,273
God, that is good TV!

25
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,991
Come on, Pheebs. Play with me!

26
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:08,459
No! This game is grotesque!

27
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:16,360
Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar forced to play soccer forever?

29
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,461
Hello? Human rights violation!

30
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:26,372
Don't feel bad. After playing I break out the plastic women and everybody has a good time.

32
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,440
Why don't you play with your roommate?

33
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,342
He's not a big fan of foosball.

34
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:36,354
Are we not getting along with the new boy?

35
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:40,392
No, he's all right. He spends most of his time in his room.

36
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:45,261
Because you haven't gotten to know him. Let's remedy that.

37
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:46,930
We don't need to remedy that.

38
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,562
Yeah, it'll be fun!

39
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,470
What was that?

40
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:57,369
Hi! I just thought it'd be fun if we had beers and got to know each other.

41
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,960
All right.

42
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,410
Oh, good! Okay.

43
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:08,410
Oh, no! I have to go because I'm late for my Green Eggs and Ham discussion group.

45
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:12,447
Tonight, it's, ''Why he would not eat them on a train.''

46
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,272
Have fun! Bye!

47
00:03:14,272 --> 00:03:15,318
That was so lame.

48
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,352
I know.

49
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,261
Okay, talk to him.

50
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:28,264
So you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets or...?

51
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,371
That's good. Who broke up with who?

52
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:39,476
I broke up with her. She thought Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.

53
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:45,350
That's good! When everybody knows the capital of Cambodia is....

54
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,552
Well, it's not Sean Penn.

55
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,353
All right, I got a funny one.

56
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:56,266
My last girlfriend, Tilly, we're eating breakfast. I made 50 pancakes.

57
00:03:56,302 --> 00:04:01,205
All of a sudden, she turns to me and says, ''I don't wanna see you anymore.''

58
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:09,443
It was like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart and smeared it all over my life!

60
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:16,322
There was this incredible abyss and I'm falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop!

62
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,253
That wasn't such a funny story, was it?

63
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,327
A crusty old man Said I'll do what I can

64
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,431
And the rest of the rats Played maracas

65
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,534
That's it! Thanks! Good night.

66
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,380
Phoebe's got another job, right?

67
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:44,762
Great set tonight, Pheebs.

68
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:46,275
I know.

69
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,379
We should get going.

70
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:52,254
We should go too. I got patients in the morning.

71
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:55,293
You know how we always stay at your place?

72
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,892
I thought we'd stay at my place.

73
00:04:57,892 --> 00:05:00,423
I don't know. I don't have my jammies.

74
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,394
You don't need them.

75
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,404
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.

76
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,434
Shut up. I'm happy.

77
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,336
Oh, this is so nice! I have to make a speech.

78
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:23,415
I want to say, of all the guys Monica has been with, and that is a lot...I like you the best.

80
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:26,425
Thank you, Pheebs. That's very sweet.

81
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,318
You hear that?

82
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:33,424
She likes me best. And apparently, there have been a lot.

83
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:37,425
Not a lot. Phoebe's kidding. Phoebe's crazy.

84
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,432
Phoebe's dead.

85
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,474
I'm looking for Eddie Manoick.

86
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,550
He's not here now. I'm Chandler. Can I take a message or a fish-tank?

87
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,819
Thanks.

88
00:05:57,819 --> 00:05:59,349
Come on in.

89
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,383
I'm Tilly.

90
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:09,400
I gather by that ''Oh,'' he told you about me.

91
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:16,441
Yeah, your name came up in a conversation that terrified me to my very soul.

93
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,310
He's kind of intense.

94
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:22,314
Yes! Can I ask you, is Eddie a little--?

95
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:23,832
A little what?

96
00:06:23,832 --> 00:06:25,316
Bit country?

97
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:32,450
Or, you know, a little rock 'n' roll?

98
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,351
Come on in here, you roomie!

99
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,259
Hello, Tilly.

100
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,457
I just came by to drop off your tank.

101
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:44,226
That was very thoughtful of you. It's very thoughtful.

102
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,468
Well, okay then.

103
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,458
I'm gonna go. Bye.

104
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,540
Bye!

105
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,444
So we getting a fish?

106
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:01,317
You had sex with her, didn't you?

107
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,383
Pheebs! Check it out, check it out, check it out!

108
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:11,329
Soap Opera Digest! That's one of my favorite digests!

109
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:14,389
Page 42! Page 42! Page 42!

110
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:20,228
''New Doc on the Block, Days of our Lives Joey Tribbiani.''

111
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,297
Cool picture!

112
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,399
Oh, I look good.

113
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:29,313
Is this true? That you write a lot of your lines?

114
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,314
Well, kind of, yeah.

115
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:35,444
Remember last week when Alex was in the accident?

116
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:41,319
The script said, ''If we don't get this woman to a hospital she'll die.''

117
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:46,421
But I made it, ''If this woman doesn't get to a hospital she won't live.''

118
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,462
Oh, okay. I see what you did there.

119
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,472
Aren't you afraid the writers will be mad when they read this?

120
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:05,313
I never thought about the writers. The scripts just come to my house.

121
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,378
But you know what?

122
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:13,391
This makes me look good, which makes the show and the writers look good.

123
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,286
How could they be mad?

124
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:22,197
Makes up most of his lines. Son of a....

125
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,205
Write this,jerk-weed.

126
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:31,233
I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean?

127
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,303
I don't know. I just bring the scripts.

128
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:39,409
They can't kill me! I'm Francesca's long lost son!

129
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:43,484
Right. Could you sign this?

130
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,249
No! No way! I'm not signing that!

131
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:51,422
I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.

132
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,228
How can they do this to me?

133
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,500
I'm just gonna go.

134
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,400
Sorry.

135
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,306
Well, it wasn't that many guys.

136
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:15,285
If you consider how many guys there are it's a very small percentage.

138
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,289
It's not a big a deal. I was just curious.

139
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,341
Good night.

140
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:20,291
Good night.

141
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,294
Good luck, Mon.

142
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:26,422
Before I tell you, you tell me how many women you've been with.

143
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,425
Two.

144
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,238
Two? Two?

145
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:38,207
How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?

146
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,304
Well, what can I say?

147
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:46,215
I was married to Barbara for 30 years, my high school sweetheart.

148
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,220
Now you. That's two.

149
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,445
Two it is.

150
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,316
Time for bed. I'm gonna brush my teeth.

151
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:58,261
No, wait a minute now! Come on, it's your turn.

152
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,332
Oh, come on!

153
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:06,361
You know, I don't need the actual number. Just a ballpark.

154
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,441
Okay, it is definitely less than a ballpark.

155
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,247
I am so glad I'm not Monica right now.

156
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,544
Tell me about it.

157
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,277
So what's your magic number?

158
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:29,258
Come on, you know everyone I've been with. All both of them.

159
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,488
Well, there's you.

160
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,300
Better not be doing these in order.

161
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:43,400
Billy Dreskin, Pete Carny, Barry and oh, Paolo.

163
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,378
Oh, yes, the weenie from Turinie.

164
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,315
Honey, are you jealous of Paolo?

165
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:56,286
I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him.

166
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,384
Really?

167
00:10:57,384 --> 00:10:58,379
Oh, please!

168
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,358
That Paolo thing was barely a relationship.

169
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:05,363
All it really was just meaningless, animal sex.

170
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:14,532
Okay, you know, that sounded so much better in my head.

171
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,434
Eddie, I didn't sleep with her!

172
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:21,338
That's what someone who slept with her would say.

173
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:27,248
This is nuts! She was over for two minutes dropped off a fish tank and left!

175
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:28,366
Where's Buddy?

176
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:29,446
Buddy?

177
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,388
My fish, Buddy.

178
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,350
There was no fish when she dropped it off.

179
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:43,401
This is unbelievable! First you sleep with my ex-girlfriend insult me by lying, then you kill my fish, my Buddy?

181
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:47,462
I didn't kill your fish! Look, Eddie--

182
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:56,475
Would you look at what I'm doing here? Now that can't be smart.

183
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:04,420
So we're gonna take this guy right off you and put him here in Mr. Pocket.

184
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,223
Tangelo?

185
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,330
That's it? That's the number you were afraid to say?

186
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:21,889
Well, yeah.

187
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:23,339
That's not bad at all.

188
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:27,334
You had me thinking it was, like, a fleet.

189
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,863
You're really okay with it?

190
00:12:29,863 --> 00:12:32,280
Oh, honey, I'm fine.

191
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,378
Okay, about that two.

192
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:42,291
What? All right, what about my two?

193
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:45,262
It just seems like a really small number.

194
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,561
Right. And...?

195
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,396
And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sow?

196
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:57,306
Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh, my God! Am I an oat?

197
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,467
Honey, you are not an oat.

198
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:03,414
I don't know, I guess I'm just not an oat guy.

199
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,401
I've only slept with women I love.

200
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:09,353
But you've only slept with two people.

201
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,248
Right.

202
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:25,237
You know I love you too, right?

203
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,364
Now I do.

204
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:34,537
Ross! Ross, please listen to me! Ross!

205
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:38,375
You are so much better for me than Paolo ever was!

206
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:42,250
You care for me, you're loving, you make me laugh.

207
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:51,489
If I make you laugh, here's an idea. Invite Paolo for a romp in the sack and I'll stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes!

209
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,296
What we have is special!

210
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,432
All Paolo and I had was--

211
00:13:57,432 --> 00:13:59,497
Animal sex? Animal sex?

212
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:06,300
So, what are you saying? There's nothing between us ''animal'' at all?

213
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:15,218
There's not even, like, a little animal? Not even, like chipmunk sex?

215
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:20,358
Try to hear me, okay?

216
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:25,227
I'm not gonna lie to you. It was good with Paolo.

217
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,878
Knock-knock.

218
00:14:26,878 --> 00:14:28,425
But!

219
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,469
What you and I have is so much better.

220
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:36,367
We have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect.

221
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:43,475
You know? I swear this is the best I have ever had.

223
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,242
Until now.

224
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,876
Richard said he loved me.

225
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:57,292
Oh, my God!

226
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:58,830
I know!

227
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,297
Honey, that's great!

228
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,866
I can't find--

229
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:03,333
Top drawer. Hurry.

230
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,353
Why? You need one too?

231
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:07,304
Oh, yeah.

232
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,397
Found them!

233
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,209
There's only one.

234
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:22,415
We'll be right there. We're trying to decide something.

235
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,235
They're trying to decide something.

236
00:15:42,235 --> 00:15:44,231
Good. Good, good.

237
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:53,544
So was your mustache, did it used to be different?

238
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,481
No.

239
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:04,390
How do you, you know, keep it so neat?

240
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,325
I have a little comb.

241
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,354
And what do you call that?

242
00:16:13,354 --> 00:16:15,305
A mustache comb.

243
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:20,403
Okay, I will do your laundry for one month.

244
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,309
No!

245
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:27,317
I will, I will.... I will clean the apartment for two months.

246
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:33,221
I'll give this to you now, if you tell me where we keep the dustpan.

247
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,333
So were you in Nam?

248
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:54,276
We are both adults here. Right? There has to be a mature way to handle this.

249
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,796
Rock, paper, scissors?

250
00:16:55,796 --> 00:16:57,246
Gotcha.

251
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,249
One, two, three.

252
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,285
Yes!

253
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,234
Fine. Go have sex.

254
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:06,247
Thank you.

255
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:11,420
No! You have got it completely wrong! John Savage was Deer Hunter, no legs.

256
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,291
Jon Voight was Coming Home, couldn't feel his legs.

257
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:19,394
You've got it the other way around, my friend. Jon Voight--

258
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,217
Honey?

259
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:22,229
What?

260
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,378
Shall we?

261
00:17:31,378 --> 00:17:32,441
It's not gonna happen.

262
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:37,314
They're doing it tonight. We can do it tomorrow.

263
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:43,224
In the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand....

264
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:51,359
When I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes!

265
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,461
Why?

266
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:57,231
He thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.

267
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,471
Why would you kill his fish?

268
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:08,186
Because sometimes, after you sleep with someone, you have to kill a fish.

269
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,323
Chandler, honey, I'm sorry.

270
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,791
Can we watch Joey's show now, please?

271
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:17,191
Wait. He's not here yet.

272
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:20,322
So? He's on the show. He knows what happens.

273
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:24,300
I'm fine about my problem now, by the way.

274
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:33,200
Amber I'll always be there for you, as a friend and as your brother.

276
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,243
Oh, Drake.

277
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,779
Hard day, huh?

278
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:39,343
First the medical award, now this?

279
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,410
Yeah. Some guys are just lucky, I guess.

280
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:48,319
Dr. Ramoray, report to first floor Emergency stat.

281
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:53,321
Well, then, I guess that's me.

282
00:18:55,467 --> 00:19:00,200
Anyone else need to go on the elevator? Dr. Horton? Dr. Wall?

283
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,297
They only said you.

284
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,277
Oh, okay. All right.

285
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,778
I love you, Drake.

286
00:19:08,778 --> 00:19:10,177
Yeah, whatever.

287
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,305
Oh, no!

288
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,181
Drake, look out!

289
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,789
Did they just kill off Joey?

290
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:21,188
No!

291
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,387
Now maybe.

292
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:29,390
Come on! Open up! We want to talk to you!

293
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,749
I don't feel like talking!

294
00:19:31,749 --> 00:19:33,296
We care about you.

295
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,822
We're worried about you.

296
00:19:35,822 --> 00:19:38,239
And some of us really have to pee!

297
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,205
I'm sorry, Joey.

298
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:49,251
Listen, sorry about your death. That really sucks.

299
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,354
We came when we saw.

300
00:19:51,354 --> 00:19:53,254
Why didn't you tell us?

301
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:58,319
I don't know. I was kind of hoping no one would find out.

302
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:02,231
Well, maybe they could find a way to bring you back.

303
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:11,241
They said when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor who could have saved me was me.

305
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:15,470
It's supposed to be some kind of irony.

306
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:22,283
You're gonna be fine. You don't need that show. It was a dumb soap opera.

307
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:25,380
It was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.

308
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:29,393
Yes! I was going to incorporate that.

309
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:33,261
Here's Monica. She'll say something nice.

310
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:39,301
I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew.

311
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:42,363
What? To me, that's nice.

312
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,988
It'll be okay. You know that.

313
00:20:44,988 --> 00:20:47,502
No, I don't.

314
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:56,386
It's like you work your whole life for something and you think when you get it, it'll never be as good as you thought.

316
00:20:56,421 --> 00:21:00,255
But this so was. It changed everything.

317
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:06,258
The other day, I got a credit card application and I was pre-approved!

319
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:12,233
I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life!

320
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:13,463
I'm sorry, man.

321
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:21,344
I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us.

323
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,372
No, that means nothing to me.

324
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:33,347
Pecan sandy? Just made them.

325
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:35,492
Yeah, all right.

326
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,775
What are these, raisins?

327
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:40,288
Sure, why not?

328
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,406
Listen, Eddie.

329
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:55,312
I've been thinking about our living situation. Why are you smiling?

330
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,382
I got a little surprise. Look. There's a new fishy.

331
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:03,411
I named him Chandler, you know, after you.

332
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:16,230
Well, that's not even a real fish.

333
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:20,234
No, that's a Goldfish cracker.

334
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,332
So what's your point, man?

335
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,440
Okay, good night.

336
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:32,348
You big freak of nature!

337
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,977
Brisk tonight.

338
00:22:59,977 --> 00:23:01,444
Oh, man.

339
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,710
Let's never speak of this.

340
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,206
You got it.
