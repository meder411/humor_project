1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,384
All right, no peeking.

2
00:00:04,192 --> 00:00:06,422
No peeking. No peeking. No peeking!

3
00:00:07,195 --> 00:00:11,325
All right, but you better be wearing clothes when I open my eyes.

4
00:00:13,335 --> 00:00:15,303
All right. Open your eyes.

5
00:00:20,308 --> 00:00:23,436
Sweet mother of all that is good and pure!

6
00:00:24,412 --> 00:00:26,829
Days of our Lives picked up my option!

7
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:29,246
Congratulations!

8
00:00:29,451 --> 00:00:34,252
Now we can watch Green Acres the way it was meant to be seen.

9
00:00:36,224 --> 00:00:37,350
So which one is mine?

10
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:41,327
Whichever one you want, man. Whichever one you want!

11
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,364
Not that one.

12
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:50,429
Oh, yes!

13
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,265
Oh, yeah! That's the stuff.

14
00:00:56,444 --> 00:00:58,344
Do we dare?

15
00:00:58,446 --> 00:01:00,209
We dare.

16
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:59,368
I can't believe two cows made a sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.

18
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:01,364
They were chair-shaped cows.

19
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,378
They never would have survived in the wild.

20
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,276
This screen is amazing. Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.

21
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:15,219
Rose Marie really belongs on a smaller screen.

22
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,424
Hi, you guys.

23
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:19,843
Hey, you.

24
00:02:19,843 --> 00:02:21,293
Hey, you.

25
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:28,833
How was your day?

26
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,431
You know, pretty much the usual.

27
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:32,735
Sun shining, birds chirping.

28
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,231
Really? Mine too.

29
00:02:34,342 --> 00:02:36,435
Hey, cool. Mine too.

30
00:02:39,414 --> 00:02:42,212
I gotta get to the museum.

31
00:02:42,417 --> 00:02:43,913
I'll see you tonight?

32
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,409
Okay.

33
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:52,348
Bye, guys!

34
00:02:55,263 --> 00:02:56,423
Tonight?

35
00:02:59,267 --> 00:03:01,332
What's tonight?

36
00:03:01,332 --> 00:03:03,397
Our first official date. First date.

37
00:03:05,273 --> 00:03:06,365
Hello?

38
00:03:07,308 --> 00:03:09,173
Hi.

39
00:03:10,278 --> 00:03:13,270
You're waitressing at my catering thing.

40
00:03:13,314 --> 00:03:15,293
Any of those words trigger anything?

41
00:03:15,293 --> 00:03:17,272
Monica, I forgot.

42
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:18,410
It's our first date.

43
00:03:19,187 --> 00:03:20,683
My mom got me this job.

44
00:03:20,683 --> 00:03:22,179
I can be a waitress!

45
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,384
Thank you, thank you. See? Phoebe! Phoebe!

46
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:32,199
You'd have to be an actual waitress. It can't be like your ''I can be a bear cub'' thing.

48
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,427
I can be a waitress. Watch this.

49
00:03:35,203 --> 00:03:37,398
Give me two number ones, 86 the bacon.

50
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:40,436
One Adam and Eve on a raft and wreck them!

51
00:03:54,422 --> 00:03:56,356
It's James Bond.

52
00:03:58,226 --> 00:03:59,739
Sorry we're late.

53
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,252
That's okay. Come on in.

54
00:04:01,296 --> 00:04:04,288
Is Monica Geller coming? I was told she was.

55
00:04:04,365 --> 00:04:06,196
Dr. Burke, it's me.

56
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:07,391
Monica?

57
00:04:08,203 --> 00:04:10,296
My God! You used to be so....

58
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:13,363
I mean, you've-- You must have lost like....

59
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:17,403
You look great.

60
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:21,473
Thank you. This is Phoebe. She'll be helping me.

61
00:04:22,217 --> 00:04:24,185
Nice to meet you.

62
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:29,304
How you been?

63
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:30,419
Great. How have you been?

64
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:35,388
You know Barbara and I split or you wouldn't do the head tilt.

65
00:04:35,496 --> 00:04:37,225
The head tilt?

66
00:04:37,298 --> 00:04:44,235
Since the divorce everybody asks how I am with a sympathetic head tilt. ''How you doing?''

68
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:45,499
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:48,334
It's fine. Believe me, I do it too.

70
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:52,436
I always answer with the ''I'm okay'' head bob. ''I'm okay.''

71
00:04:53,314 --> 00:04:56,249
''You're sure?'' ''Yeah, I'm fine.''

72
00:04:56,317 --> 00:04:59,411
I gotta set up the music. I got a new CD changer.

73
00:04:59,454 --> 00:05:03,185
The divorce only left me with four CDs to change.

74
00:05:03,258 --> 00:05:04,384
That's too bad.

75
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,192
I'll survive.

76
00:05:10,365 --> 00:05:14,267
Two larges, extra cheese on both.

77
00:05:14,302 --> 00:05:18,399
But listen don't ring the buzzer for 1 9.

79
00:05:19,207 --> 00:05:21,368
Ring 20. Geller/Greene.

80
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:25,168
They'll let you in, okay?

81
00:05:27,181 --> 00:05:30,275
If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you.

82
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:33,187
Okay, thanks.

83
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:38,382
Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up.

84
00:05:39,294 --> 00:05:41,319
What if we have to pee?

85
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:47,199
I'll cancel the sodas.

86
00:05:50,438 --> 00:05:52,497
Get out there. It's your party!

87
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:56,210
They're so dull! They're all ophthalmologists.

88
00:05:56,444 --> 00:05:58,395
You're an ophthalmologist.

89
00:05:58,395 --> 00:06:00,346
That's what my parents wanted.

90
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:03,145
I wanted to be a sheriff.

91
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:06,445
That's funny. Cadillac, cataract. I get it.

92
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:09,281
No! You stay out there!

93
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:10,788
You see?

94
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:11,385
I tell you what.

95
00:06:12,193 --> 00:06:17,153
I'll come get you in five minutes with some sort of kebab emergency.

96
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:21,392
Better. Oh, God, here we go.

97
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,398
Want to see them go nuts?

98
00:06:24,272 --> 00:06:26,206
Watch this.

99
00:06:26,374 --> 00:06:29,172
Who needs glasses?

100
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,866
You are so smitten.

101
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:38,316
I am not!

102
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:42,484
Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten.

103
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:44,341
Ask him out.

104
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:45,291
Dr. Burke?

105
00:06:46,194 --> 00:06:50,221
I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grownup.

106
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,293
So? You two are totally into each other.

107
00:06:54,402 --> 00:06:58,202
He's a family friend. He's 20 years older than me.

108
00:06:58,306 --> 00:07:01,139
So you're never gonna see him again?

109
00:07:01,242 --> 00:07:02,334
Not never.

110
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:06,371
I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.

111
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:09,260
Didn't you just get your eyes checked?

112
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:15,345
Yeah, but you know 27 is a dangerous eye age.

115
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:22,160
They're picking teams to play ''Guess my prescription.'' Help me!

116
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:32,161
I'm not saying it was a bad movie. I'm saying it was a little hard to follow.

118
00:07:32,373 --> 00:07:34,386
I told you there would be subtitles.

119
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:36,399
I know.

120
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:41,372
I just didn't want to wear my glasses on our first date.

121
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,282
Monica?

122
00:07:54,195 --> 00:07:58,393
It would help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout my sister's name.

123
00:07:58,433 --> 00:08:00,230
I'm just checking.

124
00:08:01,335 --> 00:08:02,734
Monica?

125
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:04,133
Mon?

126
00:08:34,402 --> 00:08:36,267
What?

127
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,167
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:38,272 --> 00:08:45,177
When you moved your hands down to my butt it was, like, ''Whoa! Ross's hands are on my butt!''

130
00:08:46,414 --> 00:08:49,178
And that's funny. Why?

131
00:08:50,318 --> 00:08:52,286
Well, it's not.

132
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,379
Sorry. I'm just nervous.

133
00:08:54,422 --> 00:08:58,324
I mean, it's you. You know, it's us.

134
00:08:58,426 --> 00:09:02,260
We're crossing that line. It's sort of a big thing.

135
00:09:02,363 --> 00:09:07,232
Well, I know it's big. I just didn't know it was ha-ha big.

136
00:09:18,346 --> 00:09:21,338
Okay, my hands were nowhere near your butt.

137
00:09:21,382 --> 00:09:23,179
I know! I know!

138
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:26,379
I was thinking about the last time they were there.

139
00:09:27,154 --> 00:09:29,247
I'm sorry. Look! I promise.

140
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,282
I won't laugh anymore. Put your hands back.

141
00:09:32,393 --> 00:09:35,260
No, see, now I can't.

142
00:09:36,297 --> 00:09:38,276
I'm feeling too self-conscious.

143
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:40,255
Touch my butt.

144
00:09:41,202 --> 00:09:42,749
Just one cheek.

145
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,296
The moment's gone.

146
00:09:44,405 --> 00:09:45,901
I'll back up into your hands.

147
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:47,397
That's romantic.

148
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:49,198
-Touch it.
-No.

149
00:09:49,277 --> 00:09:51,177
-Come on, squeeze it.
-No!

150
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,268
-Rub it?
-No.

151
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,315
Oh, come on! Would you just grab my ass?

152
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:12,425
Wow! Look at that! The car is on fire yet somehow its expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax.

155
00:10:14,402 --> 00:10:17,303
You got a Chee-to on your face, man.

156
00:10:28,249 --> 00:10:31,309
Aren't you supposed to be out with Rachel?

157
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:33,410
That was 1 4 hours ago.

158
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:38,323
We gotta set the clock on this.

159
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,328
So how'd it go?

160
00:10:42,363 --> 00:10:49,327
Have you ever been, you know, fooling around with a girl and she started laughing?

162
00:10:49,537 --> 00:10:51,266
Yeah.

163
00:10:51,372 --> 00:10:57,277
But it was 1 982 and my Flock of Seagulls haircut tickled her chin.

164
00:11:00,214 --> 00:11:01,374
She laughed at you?

165
00:11:01,415 --> 00:11:04,213
It could have been worse.

166
00:11:04,285 --> 00:11:06,276
I could have been naked.

167
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:14,192
I've wanted this since 9th grade.

168
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:20,199
I want it to be perfect and right and....

170
00:11:20,434 --> 00:11:24,200
Why isn't that laser cutting through the paint?

171
00:11:24,305 --> 00:11:25,852
It's the Miracle Wax!

172
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,399
It certainly is a miracle.

173
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:28,806
Hi, you guys.

174
00:11:28,806 --> 00:11:29,403
Hey.

175
00:11:31,345 --> 00:11:33,438
Listen, I was thinking about....

176
00:11:34,248 --> 00:11:35,442
Can you guys speak up?

177
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:39,516
It's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice.

178
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:40,867
Hallway?

179
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:41,413
Yeah.

180
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,326
I'm sorry about last night. I really want to make it up to you.

181
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:55,528
There's no need to make it-- How?

182
00:11:57,271 --> 00:12:04,277
Well, I was thinking maybe a romantic dinner with candles and wine.

184
00:12:04,311 --> 00:12:12,185
And then maybe going back to my place for dessert.

186
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:16,388
That sounds perfect.

188
00:12:24,398 --> 00:12:26,298
What's this?

189
00:12:26,298 --> 00:12:28,198
Would you get us a couple of beers?

190
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,207
I'm going to look into your eyes now.

191
00:12:36,243 --> 00:12:37,437
Really?

192
00:12:38,245 --> 00:12:40,236
Yeah, that's my job.

193
00:12:41,215 --> 00:12:43,342
All right. Look up.

194
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:45,407
Look down.

195
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,317
No, open your eyes and look down.

196
00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:50,245
That's right.

197
00:12:50,324 --> 00:12:52,258
Look into the light.

198
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:55,318
Now look at me.

199
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,161
Okay!

200
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:09,276
Your eyes look good. Those are good eyes.

201
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:11,367
Good. They feel good.

202
00:13:12,213 --> 00:13:13,271
In my head.

203
00:13:19,186 --> 00:13:20,301
It was great to see you.

204
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:21,416
You too.

205
00:13:22,423 --> 00:13:24,323
You too.

206
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:30,229
Goodbye.

207
00:13:31,398 --> 00:13:32,393
Drops!

208
00:13:32,393 --> 00:13:33,388
What?

209
00:13:34,235 --> 00:13:35,395
Here, they're free.

210
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:40,339
Thanks.

211
00:13:41,442 --> 00:13:43,325
I better be going.

212
00:13:43,325 --> 00:13:45,208
Yeah, I'll see you later.

213
00:13:45,312 --> 00:13:47,303
Thanks again.

214
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:04,296
We have to get you lazy boys out of these chairs.

215
00:14:07,268 --> 00:14:11,261
You should go out and be with the three-dimensional people.

216
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:14,397
No. Inside good.

217
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:18,209
Outside bad.

218
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:20,404
You guys are so pathetic.

219
00:14:21,182 --> 00:14:22,308
Oh, Xanadu!

220
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,187
She's one of us now.

221
00:14:30,224 --> 00:14:31,270
Hi, you guys.

222
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,316
Hey.

223
00:14:33,227 --> 00:14:35,422
We wanted to stop by and say good night.

224
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,198
Good night.

225
00:14:38,332 --> 00:14:40,880
They won't even turn their heads.

226
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,428
All right. I'm taking off my shirt.

227
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,401
No. She's lying.

228
00:14:53,214 --> 00:14:57,344
Stop sending food to our apartment!

229
00:14:58,352 --> 00:15:00,303
Why are you dressed up?

230
00:15:00,303 --> 00:15:02,254
You're not the only one with a date.

231
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:03,335
You have a date? Who with?

232
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:04,381
No one.

233
00:15:05,192 --> 00:15:06,238
What's his name?

234
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,284
Nothing.

235
00:15:08,262 --> 00:15:09,286
Come on, tell me.

236
00:15:10,264 --> 00:15:13,165
All right, but I'm excited about this.

237
00:15:13,267 --> 00:15:16,361
Promise you won't get big-brothery and judgmental.

238
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,402
I promise.

239
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:19,285
Richard Burke.

240
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,365
Who's Richard Burke?

241
00:15:20,474 --> 00:15:22,203
Dr. Burke?

242
00:15:23,277 --> 00:15:29,278
You have a date with Dr. Burke? Why? Why? Why should that bother me?

244
00:15:29,316 --> 00:15:33,216
I love that man. He's like a a brother to Dad.

246
00:15:36,423 --> 00:15:38,857
Here we go.

247
00:15:38,857 --> 00:15:41,291
No, I think it's great that he's 50.

248
00:15:41,428 --> 00:15:46,388
He'll be an inspiration to men who are almost retired all over the world.

249
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:51,399
He's the brightest, most sophisticated, sexiest man I've ever been with.

250
00:15:51,438 --> 00:15:53,201
He's sexy?

251
00:15:53,307 --> 00:15:56,333
Oh, God! Absolutely!

252
00:15:58,212 --> 00:15:59,236
Damn!

253
00:15:59,346 --> 00:16:01,337
It's the museum again. Can I--?

254
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,213
Dr. Burke kissed me once.

255
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,276
When?

256
00:16:05,352 --> 00:16:13,354
When I was 7, I crashed my bike out in front of his house and to stop me from crying, he kissed me right here.

258
00:16:14,161 --> 00:16:14,809
Oh, you are so lucky!

259
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:15,457
I know.

260
00:16:17,197 --> 00:16:20,394
Australopithecus isn't supposed to be in that display.

261
00:16:22,403 --> 00:16:27,272
No, Homo habilis was erect. Australopithecus was never fully erect.

262
00:16:27,374 --> 00:16:29,365
Well, maybe he was nervous.

263
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:39,284
Oh, look! I can't believe this!

264
00:16:39,386 --> 00:16:43,379
Homo habilis can't use tools yet, and he has clay pots?

265
00:16:44,191 --> 00:16:47,183
Why don't they just give him a microwave?

266
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:50,286
Clearly he'd have no place to plug it in.

267
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,491
Sorry.

268
00:16:56,303 --> 00:17:00,262
I'm sorry this is taking so long. It's longer than I expected.

269
00:17:00,374 --> 00:17:01,369
We will have dinner.

270
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:02,364
It's fine.

271
00:17:03,177 --> 00:17:05,145
Karl!

272
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,211
Oh, God.

273
00:17:21,195 --> 00:17:22,292
Wow! Is that Michelle?

274
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:23,389
Yep.

275
00:17:24,164 --> 00:17:26,359
I've not seen her since graduation.

276
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,166
Oh, my God, that night she got so dru--

277
00:17:32,272 --> 00:17:33,364
Emotional.

278
00:17:34,174 --> 00:17:36,267
You know, she's having another baby.

279
00:17:36,377 --> 00:17:38,373
I thought she just had one.

280
00:17:38,373 --> 00:17:40,369
No, no. Henry's almost 2.

281
00:17:40,414 --> 00:17:44,373
And he's talking and everything. Here.

282
00:17:45,185 --> 00:17:48,416
He told me he liked me better than his other grandpa.

283
00:17:49,189 --> 00:17:53,182
In all fairness, his other grandpa's a drunk, but still....

284
00:17:55,295 --> 00:17:57,286
You're a grandpa.

285
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:01,361
Yeah.

286
00:18:06,273 --> 00:18:08,264
Are we nuts here?

287
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,240
I don't know. Maybe.

288
00:18:10,344 --> 00:18:15,372
I mean, I'm dating a man whose pool I once peed in.

289
00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:18,344
I didn't need to know that.

290
00:18:19,253 --> 00:18:22,154
I guess 21 years is a lot.

291
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:27,149
Hell, I'm a whole ''person who can drink'' older than you.

292
00:18:28,262 --> 00:18:30,162
Yeah.

293
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:33,461
So....

294
00:18:36,403 --> 00:18:38,337
So maybe we should just....

295
00:18:38,337 --> 00:18:40,271
Yeah.

296
00:18:42,376 --> 00:18:44,276
Maybe....

297
00:18:48,182 --> 00:18:49,410
Wow.

298
00:18:51,418 --> 00:18:53,181
This really sucks.

299
00:18:53,287 --> 00:18:56,188
Yeah, it sure does.

300
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,266
We don't have to decide anything now, do we?

301
00:19:16,376 --> 00:19:19,436
No, there's no rush or anything.

302
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:22,343
Pizza delivery!

303
00:19:22,343 --> 00:19:24,339
Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys!

304
00:19:27,187 --> 00:19:28,279
Rach.

305
00:19:28,388 --> 00:19:30,288
I'm done.

306
00:19:30,457 --> 00:19:34,154
Yeah, well, you know what? So is Sorrentino's.

307
00:19:34,261 --> 00:19:37,355
I'm sorry. Why don't we find someplace else?

308
00:19:37,397 --> 00:19:41,265
It's late. Everything's closed. We'll do it again.

309
00:19:41,301 --> 00:19:42,393
No, no, we won't.

310
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,262
We won't?

311
00:19:45,205 --> 00:19:46,399
Come on.

312
00:19:47,207 --> 00:19:48,401
Okay, that's dead, right?

313
00:19:51,278 --> 00:19:53,178
What are we doing?

314
00:19:53,213 --> 00:19:54,845
Do you want Cran-Apple or Cran-Grape?

315
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:56,477
Grape.

316
00:19:59,186 --> 00:20:02,287
Okay, now sit.

318
00:20:06,393 --> 00:20:09,385
Oh, my God!

319
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:13,297
Billions of years ago, Earth was only--

320
00:20:15,302 --> 00:20:16,291
Sorry.

321
00:20:20,307 --> 00:20:23,308
So what are we looking at?

323
00:20:24,344 --> 00:20:28,303
See that little cluster of stars next to the big one?

324
00:20:28,348 --> 00:20:31,249
That is Ursa Major.

325
00:20:31,418 --> 00:20:32,931
Really?

326
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,444
I have no idea. Could be.

327
00:20:37,457 --> 00:20:40,255
I'm sorry I had to work tonight.

328
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,428
Oh, that's okay.

329
00:20:42,462 --> 00:20:45,226
You were worth the wait.

330
00:20:45,465 --> 00:20:48,434
And I don't just mean tonight.

331
00:20:57,444 --> 00:20:59,435
You're not laughing.

332
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:02,312
This time it's not so funny.

333
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,293
Loosen the knot.

334
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:36,511
Oh, God!

335
00:21:37,517 --> 00:21:41,317
Honey? That's okay.

336
00:21:41,455 --> 00:21:43,355
What?

337
00:21:43,457 --> 00:21:46,449
Oh, no. You just rolled over the juice box.

338
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:57,328
Thank God!

339
00:22:25,198 --> 00:22:26,392
Hey.

340
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,191
Hey, you.

341
00:22:34,308 --> 00:22:37,300
I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.

342
00:22:37,444 --> 00:22:39,503
I know. It is pretty unbelieve--

343
00:22:41,415 --> 00:22:42,928
What?

344
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,441
We're not alone.

345
00:23:12,312 --> 00:23:14,371
Is that the fire alarm?

346
00:23:14,481 --> 00:23:16,210
Yeah.

347
00:23:19,386 --> 00:23:22,321
It's not warm yet. We still have time.

348
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,188
-Cool.
-Yeah, yeah. Cool!
