1
00:00:05,391 --> 00:00:07,421
Slow down! The paper won't be

2
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:09,451
sold-out at 1 :00 in the morning.

3
00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:10,960
I'm excited!

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,359
I've never been reviewed!

5
00:00:12,464 --> 00:00:14,415
You were so amazing as the king.

6
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:16,366
I was really impressed.

7
00:00:16,468 --> 00:00:17,492
But you know what?

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,385
You might wanna wear

9
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:20,500
underwear next time.

10
00:00:21,306 --> 00:00:22,853
When you sat on the throne,

11
00:00:22,853 --> 00:00:26,489
you could see your royal subjects.

13
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:28,502
No one wore underwear back then.

14
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:30,879
I'm sure the critics

15
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:32,477
appreciated your authenticity.

16
00:00:32,518 --> 00:00:34,486
Nice genitals, by the way.

17
00:00:35,387 --> 00:00:36,479
Thanks, man.

18
00:00:37,322 --> 00:00:38,414
Here it is!

19
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,407
''The only thing worse than

20
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:44,862
the mindless direction was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly

22
00:00:44,862 --> 00:00:47,330
unskilled portrayal of the king.''

23
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:49,524
Look, that is one guy's opinion.

24
00:00:50,335 --> 00:00:51,415
All right?

25
00:00:51,415 --> 00:00:52,495
Pheebs, read yours.

26
00:00:53,305 --> 00:00:54,869
''The only thing worse

27
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:56,433
than the mindless--''

28
00:00:56,542 --> 00:00:58,407
Does anybody have one

29
00:00:58,407 --> 00:01:00,272
from a different paper?

30
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:02,313
Ross, read yours.

31
00:01:02,313 --> 00:01:04,247
I don't want to.

32
00:01:05,451 --> 00:01:07,948
''The one enjoyable moment is when the

33
00:01:07,948 --> 00:01:10,445
king is beheaded and speaks no more.''

34
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:12,937
Joey, they don't know

35
00:01:12,937 --> 00:01:14,484
what they're talking about.

36
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,349
Maybe they do.

37
00:01:16,462 --> 00:01:18,475
I've done this 10 years

38
00:01:18,475 --> 00:01:20,488
and I'm nowhere. There's a reason.

39
00:01:21,266 --> 00:01:23,359
Come on, you're just paying dues.

40
00:01:23,402 --> 00:01:25,432
No, no, no. It's too hard.

41
00:01:25,432 --> 00:01:27,462
It's not worth it. I quit.

42
00:01:28,273 --> 00:01:29,297
Come on, Joey!

43
00:01:29,408 --> 00:01:30,454
Wait, wait one minute.

44
00:01:30,454 --> 00:01:31,500
Wait a minute.

45
00:01:32,277 --> 00:01:34,472
I believe this will change your mind.

46
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,379
''In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiani

47
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:39,478
achieved brilliant levels of--

48
00:01:40,285 --> 00:01:42,276
Continued on page 1 53.

49
00:01:42,521 --> 00:01:44,284
--sucking.''

50
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:31,936
Is there anything else you

51
00:02:31,936 --> 00:02:33,403
wanted to be?

52
00:02:33,472 --> 00:02:34,496
I don't know.

53
00:02:35,374 --> 00:02:37,365
I used to want to be a vet.

54
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:39,439
Then I found out you have to put

55
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:41,469
your hands into cows and stuff.

56
00:02:46,385 --> 00:02:47,317
Are you okay?

57
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:50,286
Just a tough day at work, you know?

58
00:02:50,322 --> 00:02:53,485
Stegosaurus fell and trapped a kid.

59
00:02:55,427 --> 00:02:57,457
I know this jacket. This is Fun

60
00:02:57,457 --> 00:02:59,487
Bobby's jacket! Where is he?

61
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:00,395
Is he here?

62
00:03:00,395 --> 00:03:01,259
Maybe.

63
00:03:01,366 --> 00:03:02,526
Don't toy with me.

64
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:04,348
Geller!

65
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:05,428
Hey, Fun Bobby!

66
00:03:06,238 --> 00:03:07,535
Hey! You been working out?

67
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:09,262
Not at all.

68
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:10,467
I love this guy!

69
00:03:12,277 --> 00:03:14,370
I'm psyched you're back with Monica.

70
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,929
You and me both!

71
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,379
So what'd I miss?

72
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:20,247
We're making Joey feel better.

73
00:03:20,352 --> 00:03:21,848
Want me to pick you up?

74
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:23,344
I'm all right, man.

75
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:25,252
I'm picking you up!

76
00:03:25,357 --> 00:03:26,853
No, seriously.

77
00:03:26,853 --> 00:03:28,349
I don't need you to--

78
00:03:30,362 --> 00:03:31,454
It still works!

79
00:03:32,264 --> 00:03:34,277
Okay, now before I go, does

80
00:03:34,277 --> 00:03:36,290
anybody else need to be picked up?

81
00:03:36,368 --> 00:03:37,460
I'm still gonna go.

82
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,371
Okay, I'll see you later, baby.

83
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:44,355
Public display of affection coming up.

84
00:03:44,355 --> 00:03:46,403
You can avert your eyes.

85
00:03:53,385 --> 00:03:54,335
See you.

86
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:55,285
See you later.

87
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,950
Fun Bobby is so great.

88
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,480
Oh, isn't he?

89
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,321
I think this time it may work

90
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:03,351
with him. He makes me feel so good.

91
00:04:03,428 --> 00:04:05,345
I've been feeling lousy lately.

92
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,262
No job, no boyfriend.

93
00:04:07,332 --> 00:04:09,425
At least my cup is half-full.

94
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:12,326
Half-full of love.

95
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,838
For our two-week anniversary,

96
00:04:16,838 --> 00:04:18,436
we're going to a cabin.

97
00:04:18,477 --> 00:04:21,241
Cabin of love.

98
00:04:23,248 --> 00:04:24,863
We had a lot of wine tonight.

99
00:04:24,863 --> 00:04:26,478
I only had two glasses.

100
00:04:27,286 --> 00:04:28,270
I just had a glass.

101
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,254
Two.

102
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:30,417
I had one.

103
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:34,308
I had a mug full in this ''I got boned at the

105
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:36,259
Museum of Natural History'' mug.

106
00:04:37,262 --> 00:04:38,359
Okay, so that's what?

107
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:39,456
Two bottles.

108
00:04:39,498 --> 00:04:42,399
And yet somehow we went through five?

109
00:04:55,314 --> 00:04:56,394
So what?

110
00:04:56,394 --> 00:04:57,474
So he drank a lot tonight.

111
00:04:57,582 --> 00:04:59,465
Now that I think of it, I don't

112
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:04,218
think I've seen Fun Bobby without a drink.

114
00:05:05,424 --> 00:05:07,420
And did you notice how

115
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,416
he always starts his stories with:

116
00:05:09,528 --> 00:05:11,945
''Okay, I was so wasted!''

117
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,362
or ''Oh, we were so bombed!''

118
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:16,833
''So I wake up and I'm in

119
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:19,233
this dumpster in Connecticut!''

120
00:05:19,438 --> 00:05:20,934
Have you been with him

121
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:22,430
when he wasn't drinking?

122
00:05:22,541 --> 00:05:24,441
We go to a lot of places where

123
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:26,341
you might drink.

124
00:05:26,378 --> 00:05:27,925
How do you go to a winetasting

125
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:29,472
without drinking?

126
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:34,445
Or to a club, or to the zoo.

128
00:05:39,358 --> 00:05:41,451
Rach, does this have nonfat milk?

129
00:05:42,294 --> 00:05:44,262
I don't know, taste it.

130
00:05:46,465 --> 00:05:47,454
No.

131
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:49,864
Oh, well, too late.

132
00:05:49,864 --> 00:05:51,462
Sorry, you already had some.

133
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:54,885
What do you say

134
00:05:54,885 --> 00:05:56,398
we make these coffees Irish?

135
00:06:00,312 --> 00:06:01,404
Cake!

136
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:05,314
Yeah, we're gonna get some cake.

137
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:09,448
It seems you've been making

138
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:11,444
a lot of stuff ''Irish'' lately.

139
00:06:12,257 --> 00:06:14,805
I'd make them Belgian, but the waffles

140
00:06:14,805 --> 00:06:17,353
are hard to get into that flask.

141
00:06:18,363 --> 00:06:19,421
Yeah, okay.

142
00:06:19,531 --> 00:06:22,432
Look, maybe it's none of my business.

143
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:25,333
Or maybe it is, I don't know.

144
00:06:25,437 --> 00:06:27,428
I'm kind of worried about you.

145
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,288
This isn't the first time somebody

146
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:32,336
said something to me about this.

147
00:06:32,444 --> 00:06:34,361
But I always made excuses,

148
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:36,278
like ''I'm a social drinker.''

149
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:38,474
Or ''Come on, it's Flag Day!''

150
00:06:41,253 --> 00:06:43,483
So, what are you saying now?

151
00:06:44,356 --> 00:06:48,291
I guess I'm saying I'll try and quit.

153
00:06:48,393 --> 00:06:49,877
I kind of like

154
00:06:49,877 --> 00:06:51,361
that you worry about me.

155
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:55,489
So, what's going on?

156
00:06:56,368 --> 00:06:58,302
I am gonna try and quit drinking.

157
00:06:58,302 --> 00:07:00,236
Oh! Why?

158
00:07:07,312 --> 00:07:09,439
Guess who's back in show business.

159
00:07:10,248 --> 00:07:11,510
Lorne Greene?

160
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:15,516
No. You know why? He's dead.

161
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:17,345
Oh, no.

162
00:07:19,424 --> 00:07:21,921
This is gonna seem bittersweet now,

163
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:24,418
but Joey, that's who!

164
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:27,297
My agent called with an audition

165
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:29,231
for Days of Our Lives!

166
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:30,881
Kick ass!

167
00:07:30,881 --> 00:07:32,428
Here's to Joey!

168
00:07:33,438 --> 00:07:35,235
Here Joey.

169
00:07:38,443 --> 00:07:40,411
We have to celebrate.

170
00:07:40,411 --> 00:07:42,379
We should do a soap opera theme.

171
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:44,944
We could all sleep together,

172
00:07:44,944 --> 00:07:47,441
then one of us could get amnesia!

173
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:52,322
When do you get off?

174
00:07:52,322 --> 00:07:54,256
We'll do something tonight.

175
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:56,374
Well, actually, I'm already done.

176
00:07:56,374 --> 00:07:58,456
But I kind of got plans.

177
00:07:58,497 --> 00:08:01,295
You have other friends?

178
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:03,350
Yeah, I.... I have a date.

179
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,301
What?

180
00:08:05,403 --> 00:08:06,870
You have a date?

181
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,337
Yes! I have a date.

182
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:10,435
With a man?

183
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:13,300
No, with a crouton.

184
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:15,828
What's strange about me dating?

185
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,211
With a crouton?

186
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,441
Rach, what about Ross?

187
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:23,346
You're still mad he made that list?

188
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:26,219
No, no, I'm not mad at him.

189
00:08:26,324 --> 00:08:27,774
I'm not really ''anything''

190
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:29,224
at him anymore.

191
00:08:29,327 --> 00:08:31,278
What are you talking about?

192
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:33,229
I don't know.

193
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:36,467
Whatever I was feeling, I'm not.

195
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:38,429
You guys came so close.

196
00:08:38,503 --> 00:08:40,368
I'm sorry. You'll have

197
00:08:40,368 --> 00:08:45,332
to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross.

199
00:08:46,344 --> 00:08:47,470
Here he is.

200
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:51,272
Guys, this is Russ.

201
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,274
Hi.

202
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,324
Estelle Leonard Talent Agency.

203
00:09:09,334 --> 00:09:10,818
Sammy would you

204
00:09:10,818 --> 00:09:12,302
stop calling me already.

205
00:09:12,404 --> 00:09:14,372
I'm not saying you're not talented.

206
00:09:14,372 --> 00:09:16,340
You're very talented.

207
00:09:16,408 --> 00:09:18,421
But with the bird dead and all,

208
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:20,434
there's very little act left.

209
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:23,305
Honey, give me a break, will you?

210
00:09:23,348 --> 00:09:25,248
I'll talk to you later.

211
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:27,382
There's my favorite client. Tell me,

212
00:09:27,382 --> 00:09:29,447
darling, how was the audition?

213
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:32,251
I think it went well.

214
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:34,247
I got a callback for Thursday.

215
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:36,338
Joey! Have you ever seen me ecstatic?

216
00:09:36,338 --> 00:09:38,317
No.

217
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,331
Well, here it is.

218
00:09:44,436 --> 00:09:46,404
Listen, there's something

219
00:09:46,404 --> 00:09:48,372
I want to talk to you about.

220
00:09:48,473 --> 00:09:50,373
The casting lady--

221
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:52,273
Oh, isn't Lori a doll?

222
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:57,311
Yeah, she's great, but I kind of got the feeling that

224
00:09:57,311 --> 00:09:59,376
she was sort of coming on to me.

225
00:09:59,451 --> 00:10:01,851
And I definitely would get the part

226
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,251
if I were to, you know....

227
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,487
If I sent the little general in.

228
00:10:13,298 --> 00:10:15,277
I see! Well, I'm just gonna

229
00:10:15,277 --> 00:10:19,384
put in a call here and we'll find out what's going on

231
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:21,466
and straighten it out.

232
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:23,501
Lori, please.

233
00:10:25,477 --> 00:10:27,377
Hi, darling!

234
00:10:27,412 --> 00:10:30,364
How about Joey Tribbiani for the part

235
00:10:30,364 --> 00:10:33,316
of the cabdriver? Isn't he terrific?

236
00:10:37,322 --> 00:10:39,381
Okay, doll, talk to you later.

237
00:10:39,491 --> 00:10:42,483
You're gonna have to sleep with her.

238
00:10:45,497 --> 00:10:46,492
What's the matter?

239
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:47,487
Fun Bobby.

240
00:10:47,532 --> 00:10:49,028
What? Isn't he sober?

241
00:10:49,028 --> 00:10:50,524
He's sober, all right.

242
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:52,866
Just turns out that Fun Bobby

243
00:10:52,866 --> 00:10:54,430
was fun for a reason.

244
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,240
All right, here you go, sweetie.

245
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:02,896
Thanks.

246
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:04,346
You wanna hear something funny?

247
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:06,440
Oh, God, yes!

248
00:11:07,485 --> 00:11:10,369
There are no hardware stores

249
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:13,253
open past midnight in the Village.

250
00:11:15,293 --> 00:11:17,261
That is funny.

251
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:19,946
I needed to buy a hammer and I'm out

252
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:22,397
walking around the neighborhood.

253
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:28,370
And I'm walking, and I'm walking and I'm walking, and I'm walking--

255
00:11:28,473 --> 00:11:31,374
So you're saying you were walking.

256
00:11:31,476 --> 00:11:34,428
Apparently, no hardware stores

257
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:37,380
are open past midnight in the Village.

258
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,514
So it's a helpful fact as well as funny.

260
00:11:51,496 --> 00:11:54,294
Don't you have your interview?

261
00:11:54,332 --> 00:11:55,492
Oh, yeah.

262
00:11:58,436 --> 00:11:59,886
See you guys.

263
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:04,374
Bye ridiculously dull Bobby.

265
00:12:05,276 --> 00:12:06,334
Oh, my God.

266
00:12:06,478 --> 00:12:08,361
He's not that bad.

267
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,244
Not that bad?

268
00:12:10,281 --> 00:12:12,329
Did you not hear the hammer story?

269
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:14,377
Okay, don't get all squinky.

270
00:12:16,287 --> 00:12:19,256
Maybe you had to be there.

271
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,286
But I'm gonna be there!

272
00:12:21,286 --> 00:12:23,282
For the rest of my life.

273
00:12:24,462 --> 00:12:26,413
I made him quit drinking.

274
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,364
He's dull because of me.

275
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,491
Don't say that.

276
00:12:30,268 --> 00:12:32,384
He's probably always been dull.

277
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,500
You just, you know, set it free.

278
00:12:37,275 --> 00:12:38,270
Hi.

279
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,265
Hey, Ross.

280
00:12:40,512 --> 00:12:42,912
Hi, Russ. I've got two more tables

281
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:45,312
to clean, and then we'll go.

282
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:54,390
I'll just sit here and chat with your friend-type people.

285
00:12:59,397 --> 00:13:00,455
Rachel?

286
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,359
You know what you're doing, right?

287
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,449
Waitressing?

288
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:09,428
Well, yeah. But, no. I mean....

289
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:11,356
Doesn't Russ just

290
00:13:11,356 --> 00:13:12,471
remind you of someone?

291
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:16,344
Bob Saget?

292
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:18,347
Oh, yeah!

293
00:13:18,483 --> 00:13:20,348
No, no, no!

294
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:22,919
Oh, my, oh!

295
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:24,386
What's wrong?

296
00:13:26,257 --> 00:13:28,373
She's upset because she buttered a

297
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:30,489
spider into her toast this morning.

298
00:13:32,497 --> 00:13:34,362
All right.

299
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:37,381
Listen, Pheebs.

300
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:38,461
This is gonna be okay.

301
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,271
Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.

302
00:13:42,507 --> 00:13:43,502
Hi.

303
00:13:43,502 --> 00:13:44,497
Hi.

304
00:13:45,376 --> 00:13:46,923
Are you a friend of Rachel's?

305
00:13:46,923 --> 00:13:48,470
Yes. Yes, I am.

306
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,413
Are you a friend of Rachel's?

307
00:13:51,482 --> 00:14:01,418
Actually, I'm kind of a you know a date-type thing of Rachel's.

311
00:14:02,227 --> 00:14:03,324
A date?

312
00:14:03,324 --> 00:14:04,421
I'm her date.

313
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,424
Oh! Oh, you're a....

314
00:14:07,232 --> 00:14:09,359
Oh, you're the date.

315
00:14:10,235 --> 00:14:12,231
This is actually good because if we

316
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:14,227
lose Ross, we have a spare.

317
00:14:15,273 --> 00:14:17,434
You are the paleontologist.

318
00:14:18,343 --> 00:14:21,312
Yes. Yes, I am. And you are a....

319
00:14:21,312 --> 00:14:24,281
Periodontist.

320
00:14:24,449 --> 00:14:26,366
See? Now they're as

321
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,479
different as night and later that night.

323
00:14:30,355 --> 00:14:34,257
Well, I am going to get a beverage.

324
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:36,327
It was nice meeting you.

325
00:14:36,327 --> 00:14:38,295
Ditto.

326
00:14:43,501 --> 00:14:46,299
Well, I met Russ.

327
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:49,370
I didn't know we were

328
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,467
seeing other people.

329
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:52,805
Well, we're not

330
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:54,301
seeing each other, so....

331
00:14:54,512 --> 00:14:57,009
For your information, a woman at

332
00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:07,435
the museum who's curator of moths and other winged things...let it be known that she is

335
00:15:07,435 --> 00:15:10,415
drawn to me, much like a...you know.

336
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,914
I've kept her at bay but if this is the deal--

338
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,364
It is.

339
00:15:16,434 --> 00:15:18,425
Well, have a nice evening.

340
00:15:19,437 --> 00:15:20,853
Russ, you ready?

341
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,269
Yeah.

342
00:15:23,341 --> 00:15:24,308
Bye.

343
00:15:24,308 --> 00:15:25,275
Bye.

344
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:30,247
She's dating?

345
00:15:30,281 --> 00:15:31,339
She's dating?

346
00:15:31,382 --> 00:15:32,912
Yes, but did you see

347
00:15:32,912 --> 00:15:34,442
who she was dating?

348
00:15:35,386 --> 00:15:36,819
What do you mean?

349
00:15:36,819 --> 00:15:38,252
Do you not see it?

350
00:15:38,356 --> 00:15:40,421
See what? I don't know

351
00:15:40,421 --> 00:15:42,486
what she sees in that goober.

352
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:45,409
It takes him, what?

353
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:49,015
Like, I don't know hello, a week

355
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:50,465
to get out a sentence?

356
00:15:51,402 --> 00:15:53,563
Annoying, isn't it?

357
00:15:56,274 --> 00:15:57,468
Yeah.

358
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,319
You didn't get the part or Italy called

360
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:13,416
and said it was hungry?

361
00:16:14,325 --> 00:16:15,889
The part's mine if I want it.

362
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:17,453
Oh, my God!

363
00:16:18,229 --> 00:16:20,424
If I sleep with the casting lady.

364
00:16:21,232 --> 00:16:23,459
Oh, my God?

366
00:16:24,435 --> 00:16:26,386
Ten years I've been waiting

367
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:28,337
for a break. Ten years!

368
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:30,839
I mean, Days of Our Lives.

369
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:33,239
That's actually on television!

370
00:16:33,344 --> 00:16:34,436
What are you gonna do?

371
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:36,343
I guess I could sleep with her.

372
00:16:36,343 --> 00:16:37,440
I mean....

373
00:16:37,482 --> 00:16:39,245
How can I do that?

374
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,398
I've got a pop-up book that told me

375
00:16:41,398 --> 00:16:43,446
all I needed to know.

376
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:46,303
I never slept with anyone for a part.

377
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:48,351
Well, is she--?

378
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,876
Sorry.

379
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,292
It's all right.

380
00:16:52,363 --> 00:16:54,359
Is she good-looking?

381
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:56,355
Yeah. She's totally good-looking.

382
00:16:56,401 --> 00:16:58,369
If I met her in a bar,

383
00:16:58,369 --> 00:17:00,337
I'd be buying her breakfast.

384
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:04,436
You know, after having slept with her.

385
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,339
Maybe this isn't such a big deal.

386
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,334
The way that I see it is, you get a

387
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:17,252
great job, and you get to have sex!

388
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:19,334
Throw in a tree and a fat guy,

389
00:17:19,334 --> 00:17:21,347
and you've got Christmas!

390
00:17:24,228 --> 00:17:26,224
I just don't think that I want it

391
00:17:26,224 --> 00:17:28,220
that way, you know?

392
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:30,460
I mean, let's say I do make it.

393
00:17:31,235 --> 00:17:33,300
I'll always look back and wonder

394
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:38,340
if it was because of my talent or you know, the little general.

396
00:17:40,244 --> 00:17:41,393
Didn't you used to call it

397
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,542
''the little major''?

398
00:17:43,281 --> 00:17:45,260
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco,

399
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,239
I had to promote it.

400
00:17:51,456 --> 00:17:53,356
Something from the bar?

401
00:17:53,356 --> 00:17:55,256
Yes, I would like something.

402
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,328
No. No, thank you.

403
00:17:58,362 --> 00:18:00,296
If you wanna drink, it's okay.

404
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:02,230
I've gotta get used to it.

405
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,797
No, really. I wouldn't feel

406
00:18:04,797 --> 00:18:07,294
right about it. Just some water.

407
00:18:07,405 --> 00:18:09,822
So my refrigerator light's out.

408
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,239
Scotch on the rocks with a twist!

409
00:18:13,211 --> 00:18:13,506
I'm sorry.

410
00:18:14,245 --> 00:18:16,338
We're having fun now, huh, Ross?

411
00:18:16,414 --> 00:18:19,212
Wanna do another one? Huh, Russ?

412
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:25,388
Okay. Eleven letters atomic element number 101 ,

414
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:27,322
ends in ''-ium.''

415
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:28,942
Dysprosium.

416
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,426
Dysprosium.

417
00:18:31,229 --> 00:18:33,225
Try mendelevium.

418
00:18:33,225 --> 00:18:35,221
And weenie number two has it.

419
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:37,930
Unless ''Nights in White Satin''

420
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,427
was sung by the Doody Blues.

421
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:45,353
You actually don't see it?

422
00:18:45,353 --> 00:18:47,332
What?

423
00:18:47,445 --> 00:18:49,345
Honey, you're dating Ross.

424
00:18:49,447 --> 00:18:51,847
No, Pheebs, I'm dating Russ.

425
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:54,247
Russ is Ross. Russ, Ross.

426
00:18:54,285 --> 00:18:55,377
Steve, sleeve.

427
00:18:55,486 --> 00:18:58,336
Okay, no one is named sleeve.

428
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:01,186
What are you talking about?

429
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:03,255
Other than their names being similar,

430
00:19:03,255 --> 00:19:05,285
I do not see what you see.

431
00:19:05,396 --> 00:19:07,392
For your information,

432
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:09,388
it's a cardsharp, not a card shark.

433
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:11,395
You couldn't be more wrong.

434
00:19:12,203 --> 00:19:13,699
You could try,

435
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:15,195
but you wouldn't be successful.

436
00:19:15,306 --> 00:19:17,319
I'll get more coffee before

437
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:19,332
the pinching and eye-poking begins.

438
00:19:21,312 --> 00:19:22,762
I know your problem.

439
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:24,212
Oh, you do, do you?

440
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:26,439
You're jealous.

441
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:29,513
Of what?

442
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:31,835
You're jealous

443
00:19:31,835 --> 00:19:33,416
because I'm a real doctor.

444
00:19:34,425 --> 00:19:36,359
You're a doctor of gums.

445
00:19:36,427 --> 00:19:38,395
That's the smallest body part

446
00:19:38,395 --> 00:19:40,363
you can major in.

447
00:19:41,232 --> 00:19:42,295
Day one, floss.

448
00:19:42,295 --> 00:19:43,358
Day two, your diploma.

449
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:44,429
Listen here--

450
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:45,424
Let me finish.

451
00:19:45,469 --> 00:19:47,869
No, let me finish.

452
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:50,269
No, you let me fin--

453
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:04,853
Did Joey say what he was gonna do?

454
00:20:04,853 --> 00:20:07,253
I don't even think he knew.

455
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:08,404
Would you sleep with someone

456
00:20:08,404 --> 00:20:09,450
for a job?

457
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:12,387
Who would I have to sleep with?

458
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:14,361
Me.

459
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,265
Why with you?

460
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:20,462
It's my game. Want the job or not?

461
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,387
Good morning.

462
00:20:25,387 --> 00:20:26,399
Where you going?

463
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:28,428
Bobby and I are going away

464
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:30,379
for the weekend. Remember?

465
00:20:31,282 --> 00:20:32,846
What's with all the liquor?

466
00:20:32,846 --> 00:20:34,410
Excuse me, miss.

467
00:20:34,518 --> 00:20:36,998
In a water landing, can this seat

468
00:20:36,998 --> 00:20:39,478
be used as a flotation device?

469
00:20:40,491 --> 00:20:43,289
Is Bobby drinking again?

470
00:20:43,394 --> 00:20:46,488
This is not for him. This is for me.

471
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:49,430
That way, he's sober but I find his

472
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,529
shoelace stories more amusing.

473
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,501
God! Even his knock is boring!

474
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:02,909
I'll be ready in a second.

475
00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:04,439
Could I talk to you?

476
00:21:04,482 --> 00:21:05,471
Sure.

477
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:09,282
This is hard to say.

478
00:21:09,387 --> 00:21:11,321
You fell off the wagon!

479
00:21:11,321 --> 00:21:13,255
Oh, no, no.

480
00:21:13,357 --> 00:21:14,420
It's about you.

481
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,483
What about me?

482
00:21:16,394 --> 00:21:17,924
I think you may have

483
00:21:17,924 --> 00:21:19,454
a drinking problem.

484
00:21:22,266 --> 00:21:23,358
What, these?

485
00:21:23,467 --> 00:21:26,459
No, these are for cuts and scrapes.

486
00:21:28,306 --> 00:21:30,837
Look, I'm not strong enough to be in

487
00:21:30,837 --> 00:21:33,368
a codependent relationship right now.

488
00:21:33,477 --> 00:21:35,502
Oh, shoot.

489
00:21:37,481 --> 00:21:38,948
Well, anyway,

490
00:21:38,948 --> 00:21:40,415
I hope we can be friends.

491
00:21:40,484 --> 00:21:42,418
Okay.

492
00:21:45,323 --> 00:21:46,318
Take care.

493
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:47,313
Okay. You too.

494
00:21:47,425 --> 00:21:48,483
Bye.

495
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,378
What happened?

496
00:21:54,378 --> 00:21:56,426
Well, we kind of broke up.

497
00:22:03,441 --> 00:22:05,409
Does anybody want these?

498
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:07,377
I'll take one.

499
00:22:07,445 --> 00:22:09,862
Sometimes I hold stuff like this

500
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:12,279
and pretend I'm a giant.

501
00:22:15,486 --> 00:22:16,919
Hey.

502
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,352
How'd the callback go?

503
00:22:18,456 --> 00:22:20,407
It was unbelievable. I walked in

504
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:22,358
and she was all over me.

505
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,455
So?

506
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:24,450
I couldn't do it.

507
00:22:24,562 --> 00:22:26,410
I didn't want the part that way.

508
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,258
Good for you!

509
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:31,948
Wait! After I left her office she caught up with me

511
00:22:31,948 --> 00:22:33,495
and offered a bigger part.

512
00:22:34,372 --> 00:22:35,361
So, and?

513
00:22:35,406 --> 00:22:38,438
So, you are now looking at

514
00:22:38,438 --> 00:22:43,412
Dr. Drake Ramoray, neurosurgeon recurring in

516
00:22:43,412 --> 00:22:45,312
at least four episodes!

517
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:47,407
All right, I gotta go shower.

518
00:23:00,331 --> 00:23:01,827
Hi.

519
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:03,323
Oh, hey.

520
00:23:03,367 --> 00:23:05,363
I guess you heard Rachel dumped me.

521
00:23:05,363 --> 00:23:07,359
Yeah, I'm sorry, man.

522
00:23:07,438 --> 00:23:08,934
She said I remind her

523
00:23:08,934 --> 00:23:10,430
too much of somebody.

524
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:14,274
Any idea who she's talking about?

525
00:23:14,378 --> 00:23:17,347
Oh, I do. It's Bob Saget.

526
00:23:19,283 --> 00:23:21,251
She hates him.

527
00:23:21,352 --> 00:23:22,364
Hey.

528
00:23:22,364 --> 00:23:23,376
Hey, Julie!

529
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:25,352
How are you doing?

530
00:23:25,456 --> 00:23:26,952
I don't know.

531
00:23:26,952 --> 00:23:31,290
It's weird not being with Ross but I guess I'm doing okay.

533
00:23:31,362 --> 00:23:32,909
Actually, I've got some

534
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:34,456
of his stuff that he....

535
00:23:42,273 --> 00:23:43,319
Have we met?

536
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:44,365
I don't think so.

537
00:23:44,475 --> 00:23:47,273
You look so familiar.

538
00:23:48,312 --> 00:23:50,411
Well, maybe we could talk about it

539
00:23:50,411 --> 00:23:52,510
over a cup of coffee.

540
00:23:53,284 --> 00:23:55,411
Know what? I'm sick of coffee.

541
00:23:55,486 --> 00:23:58,284
Let's go get us some juice.

542
00:23:58,322 --> 00:23:58,919
All right.

543
00:23:58,919 --> 00:23:59,516
Okay.

544
00:24:00,257 --> 00:24:01,354
Bye.

545
00:24:01,354 --> 00:24:02,451
Bye.
