1
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:07,364
How was Joan?

2
00:00:07,442 --> 00:00:08,858
Broke up with her.

3
00:00:08,858 --> 00:00:10,274
Oh, why?

4
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:11,909
Don't tell me.

5
00:00:11,909 --> 00:00:13,439
Because of the big nostril thing?

6
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:16,283
They were huge.

7
00:00:17,252 --> 00:00:19,345
When she sneezed, bats flew out.

8
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:22,289
They were not that huge.

9
00:00:22,357 --> 00:00:23,904
She leaned back,

10
00:00:23,904 --> 00:00:25,451
I could see her brain.

11
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:29,510
How many women will you reject

12
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,558
over superficial, insignificant--?

13
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,495
Hold it. I gotta side with Chandler.

14
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,869
When I first moved here, I went out

15
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:42,823
with this girl. Hot, great kisser but she had the biggest

17
00:00:42,823 --> 00:00:44,370
Adam's apple.

18
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:45,503
Drove me nuts.

19
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:48,849
You or me?

20
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:50,282
I got it.

21
00:00:50,385 --> 00:00:52,512
Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.

22
00:01:00,328 --> 00:01:03,422
You guys are messing with me, right?

23
00:01:04,433 --> 00:01:06,424
Yeah. We are.

24
00:01:07,436 --> 00:01:09,387
That's a good one.

25
00:01:09,387 --> 00:01:11,338
For a second there, I was like, whoa!

26
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,300
Name one woman you broke up with

27
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,313
for an actual real reason.

28
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,348
Maureen Rasillo.

29
00:02:05,427 --> 00:02:07,827
Because she doesn't hate Yanni

30
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:10,227
is not a real reason.

31
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:15,333
Hello, Mr. Heckles.

32
00:02:16,238 --> 00:02:17,785
You're doing it again.

33
00:02:17,785 --> 00:02:19,332
We're not doing anything.

34
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:20,908
You're stomping.

35
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:22,375
It's disturbing my birds.

36
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:26,473
You don't have birds.

37
00:02:27,382 --> 00:02:29,350
I could have birds.

38
00:02:30,352 --> 00:02:32,286
We'll try to keep it down.

39
00:02:32,387 --> 00:02:33,445
Thank you.

40
00:02:34,256 --> 00:02:36,383
I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.

41
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:39,293
All right, bye-bye.

42
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:41,462
Okay, Janice.

43
00:02:42,264 --> 00:02:43,379
Give me Janice.

44
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:44,494
That wasn't being picky.

45
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,830
We'll give you Janice.

46
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,360
I miss Janice, though.

47
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,461
Hello, Chandler Bing.

48
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:56,403
Oh, my God.

49
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:58,376
Oh, Chandler.

50
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,414
Now. Now.

51
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:07,345
That's it. There. Faster.

52
00:03:14,429 --> 00:03:16,380
Stop with the broom.

53
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,331
We're not making noise.

54
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:29,434
We won.

55
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:31,342
We did it.

56
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:36,280
Mr. Heckles.

57
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:41,418
How did this happen?

58
00:03:41,418 --> 00:03:42,481
He was sweeping.

59
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,452
They found a broom in his hand.

60
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:49,328
That's terrible.

61
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:50,260
I know.

62
00:03:50,465 --> 00:03:52,399
I was sweeping yesterday.

63
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,400
It could've been me.

64
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:58,305
Sweeping. You never know.

65
00:03:58,406 --> 00:03:59,464
Never know.

66
00:04:04,212 --> 00:04:06,311
It's very faint, but I can

67
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:08,410
still sense him in the building.

68
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:11,351
Go into the light, Mr. Heckles.

69
00:04:15,223 --> 00:04:16,315
Okay, Phoebe.

70
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,392
I'm sorry,

71
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:20,326
sometimes they need help.

72
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:23,380
Here we go.

73
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,331
That's fine, go ahead and scoff.

74
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:27,847
There are things I don't believe in.

75
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:30,327
It doesn't mean they're not true.

76
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:31,462
Such as?

77
00:04:32,274 --> 00:04:34,907
Like crop circles

78
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,540
or the Bermuda Triangle or evolution.

79
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:42,473
You don't believe in evolution?

80
00:04:43,285 --> 00:04:44,343
Not really.

81
00:04:46,388 --> 00:04:48,839
You don't believe in evolution?

82
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:51,290
I don't know. It's just, you know....

83
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:54,357
Monkeys, Darwin, it's a nice story.

84
00:04:54,357 --> 00:04:57,355
I think it's a little too easy.

85
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:02,302
''Too easy''? Too--

86
00:05:02,337 --> 00:05:04,288
The process of living things

87
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:08,321
on the planet evolving over years from single-celled

89
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:10,334
organisms is ''too easy''?

90
00:05:11,313 --> 00:05:13,304
Yeah, I just don't buy it.

91
00:05:14,316 --> 00:05:16,312
Excuse me. Evolution is not

92
00:05:16,312 --> 00:05:18,308
for you to buy, Phoebe.

93
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,388
Evolution is scientific fact,

94
00:05:20,388 --> 00:05:24,255
like the air we breathe like gravity.

96
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:27,419
Don't get me started on gravity.

97
00:05:30,432 --> 00:05:33,424
You don't believe in gravity?

98
00:05:35,236 --> 00:05:37,249
Well, it's not so much that,

99
00:05:37,249 --> 00:05:39,262
you know, I don't believe in it.

100
00:05:39,374 --> 00:05:42,890
I get the feeling that I'm not being pulled down

102
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,437
so much as I am being pushed.

103
00:05:45,246 --> 00:05:46,235
Pushed.

104
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,443
It's Isaac Newton and he's pissed.

105
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:54,448
Quick, Pheebs, hop on the ceiling.

106
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:57,954
There she is.

107
00:05:57,954 --> 00:05:59,450
And there, that's the other one.

108
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:01,775
Mr. Buddy Doyle, Heckles' attorney.

109
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:03,322
He'd like to talk.

110
00:06:03,398 --> 00:06:05,366
What can we do for you?

111
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,334
All right, here's the deal.

112
00:06:07,402 --> 00:06:12,286
According to my client's will he wants to leave

114
00:06:12,286 --> 00:06:16,393
all his earthly possessions to ''the noisy girls

116
00:06:16,393 --> 00:06:18,344
in the apartment above mine.''

117
00:06:19,414 --> 00:06:21,245
What about his family?

118
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:22,509
He didn't have any.

119
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:27,215
Okay, so let's talk money.

120
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:30,321
There was none.

121
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:32,223
Now, let's talk signing.

122
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:33,840
You be noisy girl number one.

123
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,353
And number two.

124
00:06:37,265 --> 00:06:38,761
I can't believe

125
00:06:38,761 --> 00:06:40,257
that we thought he hated us.

126
00:06:40,368 --> 00:06:42,302
It's amazing how much

127
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:46,273
you can touch someone's life without even knowing it.

129
00:06:46,374 --> 00:06:48,370
Look at this dump!

130
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,366
He hated us. It's his final revenge.

131
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,242
I've never seen so much crap.

132
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:54,879
I think this apartment

133
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:56,477
sullies the good name of crap.

134
00:06:57,485 --> 00:06:59,350
Check this out.

135
00:07:01,322 --> 00:07:02,482
Can I have this?

136
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:07,284
How can you not believe in evolution?

137
00:07:07,395 --> 00:07:09,295
I don't know, just don't.

138
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,195
Look at this funky shirt.

139
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:12,917
I've studied evolution

140
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:14,401
my entire adult life.

141
00:07:15,203 --> 00:07:16,750
We've collected fossils

142
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,306
from all over the world that show the evolution

144
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,206
of different species.

145
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:28,441
I mean, you can literally see them evolving through time.

147
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:31,510
Really? You can actually see it?

148
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:34,352
You bet. In the U.S.,

149
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:36,451
China, Africa, all over.

150
00:07:37,425 --> 00:07:39,359
See, I didn't know that.

151
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:42,253
Well, there you go.

152
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:45,999
So now the real question is,

153
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,467
who put those fossils there and why?

154
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,440
Look at this.

155
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,340
My Big Book of Grievances.

156
00:07:59,247 --> 00:08:00,305
Hey, there's me.

157
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:07,220
''April 1 7th, excessive noise Italian guy comes home with a date.''

159
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:09,281
You're in here too.

160
00:08:09,424 --> 00:08:14,323
''April 18th, excessive noise Italian guy's gay roommate

162
00:08:14,323 --> 00:08:16,319
brings home dry cleaning.''

163
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:24,432
Well, that's excellent.

164
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:28,323
Look at this lamp. Is it tacky

165
00:08:28,323 --> 00:08:30,405
or what? We have to have it.

166
00:08:31,212 --> 00:08:33,339
I think we have enough regular lamps.

167
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:35,945
What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking

168
00:08:35,945 --> 00:08:38,442
for this girlie clock or anything.

169
00:08:39,254 --> 00:08:40,835
Which, by the way,

170
00:08:40,835 --> 00:08:42,416
I also think is really cool.

171
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:45,255
It doesn't go with any of my stuff.

172
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,793
What about my stuff?

173
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,226
You don't have any.

174
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:50,354
It will be the start of my stuff.

175
00:08:50,498 --> 00:08:52,363
No.

176
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:54,849
You still think of it

177
00:08:54,849 --> 00:08:56,430
as your apartment, don't you?

178
00:08:57,238 --> 00:08:58,284
No.

179
00:08:58,284 --> 00:08:59,330
Yes, you do.

180
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:01,825
You think of it as your apartment,

181
00:09:01,825 --> 00:09:04,276
and I just rent a room.

182
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:08,348
While you ''mmm'' on that,

183
00:09:08,348 --> 00:09:11,283
I'll find a place for my new lamp.

184
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:15,320
Okay. See how I'm making

185
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,419
these little toys move?

186
00:09:19,427 --> 00:09:21,418
Opposable thumbs.

187
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:25,262
Without evolution, how do you

188
00:09:25,262 --> 00:09:27,327
explain opposable thumbs?

189
00:09:28,303 --> 00:09:30,299
Maybe the Overlords needed them

190
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:32,295
to steer their spacecrafts.

191
00:09:33,308 --> 00:09:34,400
Tell me you're joking.

192
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,278
Can't we say that you believe

193
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:39,246
in something and I don't?

194
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:42,366
No, Pheebs, we can't. Because it's

195
00:09:42,366 --> 00:09:45,318
like math. One plus one equals two.

196
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:48,433
I can't let you think that it might

197
00:09:48,433 --> 00:09:51,413
equal three or four or yellow.

198
00:09:53,361 --> 00:09:54,857
Why not?

199
00:09:54,857 --> 00:09:56,353
No, what is that all about?

200
00:09:56,431 --> 00:09:58,444
What is this obsessive need

201
00:09:58,444 --> 00:10:00,457
to make everybody agree with you?

202
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:04,249
You know what? I think maybe it's time

203
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:07,229
you put Ross under the microscope.

204
00:10:10,478 --> 00:10:14,278
Is there blood coming out of my ears?

205
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,946
Check it out.

206
00:10:16,946 --> 00:10:18,442
Heckles' high-school yearbook.

207
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:21,818
He looks so normal.

208
00:10:21,818 --> 00:10:23,382
He's even kind of cute.

209
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,909
''You crack me up in science.

210
00:10:25,909 --> 00:10:28,360
You're the funniest kid in school.''

211
00:10:28,463 --> 00:10:29,959
Funniest? Heckles?

212
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:31,455
That's what it says.

213
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,830
Heckles was voted class clown,

214
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,360
and so was I.

215
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:38,334
He was right.

216
00:10:38,334 --> 00:10:39,397
Would you listen to that?

217
00:10:39,507 --> 00:10:42,271
I'd call that excessive.

218
00:10:42,377 --> 00:10:42,871
Whoa.

219
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:43,365
What?

220
00:10:43,478 --> 00:10:45,378
Heckles played clarinet in band.

221
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:47,278
I played clarinet.

222
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:48,995
He was in the scale

223
00:10:48,995 --> 00:10:50,508
modeler's club and I was--

224
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:52,781
There was no club.

225
00:10:52,781 --> 00:10:54,277
I thought they were cool.

226
00:10:54,422 --> 00:10:56,515
So? You were both dorks.

227
00:10:57,325 --> 00:10:58,314
Big deal.

228
00:10:58,526 --> 00:10:59,993
I just think it's weird.

229
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,460
Heckles and me--

230
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,230
Heckles and me. Me--

231
00:11:04,365 --> 00:11:06,344
Me and Heckles.

232
00:11:06,344 --> 00:11:08,323
Hey, would you knock it off?!

233
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:29,286
Been here all night?

234
00:11:29,457 --> 00:11:31,453
Look at this. Pictures of the women

235
00:11:31,453 --> 00:11:33,449
Heckles went out with.

236
00:11:33,561 --> 00:11:35,512
Look what he wrote on them.

237
00:11:35,512 --> 00:11:37,463
''Vivian, too tall.''

238
00:11:37,498 --> 00:11:39,398
''Madge, big gums.''

239
00:11:40,468 --> 00:11:41,457
''Too loud.''

240
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,266
''Too smart.'' ''Makes noise

241
00:11:44,266 --> 00:11:46,262
when she eats.'' This is me.

242
00:11:46,374 --> 00:11:48,274
This is what I do.

243
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,308
I'll end up alone, just like him.

244
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:54,392
Heckles was a nutcase.

245
00:11:54,392 --> 00:11:56,371
Our trains are on the same track.

246
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:58,334
I'm 30 years behind him,

247
00:11:58,334 --> 00:12:00,251
but the stops are the same.

248
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:04,450
Bitter Town Aloneville, Hermit Junction.

250
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:08,375
We gotta get you out of here.

251
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,423
I'll buy you breakfast. Let's go.

252
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:12,522
What if I never find somebody?

253
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:15,764
What if I found her but dumped her

254
00:12:15,764 --> 00:12:18,261
because she pronounces it, supposably?

255
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:19,906
Chandler, come on,

256
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,373
you'll find somebody.

257
00:12:21,476 --> 00:12:23,444
How do you know that? How?

258
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:26,440
I don't. I'm just trying to help you.

259
00:12:27,348 --> 00:12:29,316
You guys will all get married

260
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:31,284
and I'll end up alone.

261
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:33,443
Will you promise me something?

262
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:35,768
When you're married,

263
00:12:35,768 --> 00:12:37,281
invite me over for holidays?

264
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:39,359
I don't know what we're doing.

265
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:45,456
What if we're over at her folks' place?

266
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:50,264
Yeah, I understand.

267
00:12:53,374 --> 00:12:55,422
You can come watch the Super Bowl.

268
00:12:55,422 --> 00:12:57,470
Every year, all right?

269
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,793
You know what?

270
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:02,306
I'm not gonna end up like this.

271
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,316
I'll see you, man.

272
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:15,320
Supposably.

273
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:19,426
Supposably.

274
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:24,361
Did they go to the zoo?

275
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:26,463
Supposably.

276
00:13:39,387 --> 00:13:41,446
Hi. It's me.

277
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:46,351
Oh, my God.

278
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:49,486
Janice? You called Janice?

279
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,946
Yes. Janice.

280
00:13:52,946 --> 00:13:54,493
Why is that difficult to comprehend?

281
00:13:55,303 --> 00:13:57,362
You remember Janice, right?

282
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:00,789
Yes. She was smart, she was pretty

283
00:14:00,789 --> 00:14:03,206
and she honestly cared about me.

284
00:14:03,244 --> 00:14:04,728
Janice is my last chance

285
00:14:04,728 --> 00:14:06,212
to have somebody.

286
00:14:07,315 --> 00:14:09,408
Hello.

287
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:15,217
Oh, my God.

288
00:14:17,325 --> 00:14:18,451
Look how fat she got.

289
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:22,445
Hey, it's everybody.

290
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,362
Hi, Janice.

291
00:14:24,465 --> 00:14:26,365
Janice, you're....

292
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,265
Yes, I am.

293
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:29,851
Is it--?

294
00:14:29,851 --> 00:14:30,465
Is it yours?

295
00:14:31,272 --> 00:14:33,263
You wish, Chandler Bing.

296
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:37,477
You are looking at a married lady now.

297
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:44,351
Congratulations.

298
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:46,865
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

299
00:14:46,865 --> 00:14:49,345
I couldn't wait for you forever.

300
00:14:49,457 --> 00:14:51,971
You couldn't tell me on the phone?

301
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:54,485
And miss the expression on your face?

302
00:14:55,263 --> 00:14:57,458
Oh, no. Janice likes to have her fun.

303
00:15:09,443 --> 00:15:10,939
Know what we haven't done in a while?

304
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:12,435
What?

305
00:15:13,314 --> 00:15:14,440
Hide the lamp.

306
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,350
Monica, let it go.

307
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,413
You know I'm allergic to shellfish?

308
00:15:22,223 --> 00:15:23,821
Then you'll just have

309
00:15:23,821 --> 00:15:25,419
to eat the other lamps.

310
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,457
It's scary scientist man.

311
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,267
Okay, Phoebe, this is it.

312
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:37,320
In this briefcase I carry

313
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,271
actual scientific facts.

314
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:42,240
A briefcase of facts, if you will.

315
00:15:44,345 --> 00:15:46,842
Some of these fossils are

316
00:15:46,842 --> 00:15:49,339
over 200 million years old.

317
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:50,930
Before you even start,

318
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,477
I'm not denying evolution.

319
00:15:53,254 --> 00:15:55,302
It's one of the possibilities.

320
00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:57,350
It's the only possibility.

321
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,471
Ross, could you open your mind,

322
00:15:59,471 --> 00:16:01,484
like, this much?

323
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:04,864
Didn't the brightest minds in

324
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:07,332
the world believe the Earth was flat?

325
00:16:07,435 --> 00:16:09,869
Up until 50 years ago, you thought

326
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:14,903
the atom was the smallest thing until you split it open

328
00:16:14,903 --> 00:16:17,400
and a mess of crap came out.

329
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:20,408
Are you telling me that you are so

330
00:16:20,408 --> 00:16:24,512
unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit

332
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:30,314
there's a teeny, tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?

334
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:46,466
There might be...a teeny...tiny...possibility.

338
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:50,433
I can't believe you caved.

339
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:55,398
You just abandoned

340
00:16:55,398 --> 00:16:57,349
your whole belief system.

341
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:00,286
Before, I didn't agree with you,

342
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,220
but I respected you.

343
00:17:02,323 --> 00:17:04,257
But--

344
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,191
How are you going into work tomorrow?

345
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,727
How will you face

346
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,194
the other science guys?

347
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,199
How are you going to face yourself?

348
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,378
That was fun.

349
00:17:29,378 --> 00:17:30,407
So who's hungry?

350
00:17:30,451 --> 00:17:31,440
I am.

351
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:33,231
Me too.

352
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:34,243
Let me just get my coat.

353
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:47,223
It was an accident, I swear.

354
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:49,280
I was putting on my jacket...

355
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,259
and the Iamp...and it broke.

356
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:52,919
Oh, please, Monica.

357
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,466
You've always hated my lamp.

358
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:57,272
And all of a sudden,

359
00:17:57,272 --> 00:17:59,302
it's just magically, it's just broken?

360
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,369
Phoebe, tell her?

361
00:18:01,182 --> 00:18:02,678
I didn't see it,

362
00:18:02,678 --> 00:18:04,174
I was putting on my jacket.

363
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:05,411
I want to believe you.

364
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:12,236
Hey, Chandler.

365
00:18:12,236 --> 00:18:14,215
Monica just broke my seashell lamp.

366
00:18:14,395 --> 00:18:15,419
Neat.

367
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,198
I'm gonna die alone.

368
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:22,302
Okay, you win.

369
00:18:23,204 --> 00:18:25,399
Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.

370
00:18:26,307 --> 00:18:28,758
Janice was my safety net.

371
00:18:28,758 --> 00:18:31,209
And now I have to get a snake.

372
00:18:32,313 --> 00:18:33,245
Why is that?

373
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:35,878
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man,

374
00:18:35,878 --> 00:18:38,409
I'll need a thing. You know, a hook?

375
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,518
Like that guy who eats his own face.

376
00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:44,340
So I'll be ''Crazy Man With A Snake.''

377
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,257
''Crazy Snake Man.''

378
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:48,795
I'll get more snakes, call them my

379
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,263
babies. Kids will run past my place.

380
00:18:51,332 --> 00:18:52,845
''Run away from Crazy Snake Man,''

381
00:18:52,845 --> 00:18:54,358
they'll shout.

382
00:18:57,471 --> 00:19:00,269
You've got to get over this.

383
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,854
You won't end up alone.

384
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:03,401
Of course I will.

385
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:05,809
I reject anyone who's crazy enough

386
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:09,797
to go out with me then I bitch that there

388
00:19:09,797 --> 00:19:11,412
are no great women out there.

389
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,852
You have just described almost every

390
00:19:16,852 --> 00:19:19,383
man that we've ever gone out with.

391
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:22,357
You are not a freak.

392
00:19:22,357 --> 00:19:23,386
You're a guy.

393
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:27,426
She's right. You all do it.

394
00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:30,267
This one guy stopped seeing me

395
00:19:30,267 --> 00:19:32,332
because his cat didn't like me.

396
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:33,902
Or because I fell asleep

397
00:19:33,902 --> 00:19:35,398
during Spinal Tap.

398
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:38,411
You fell asleep during Spinal Tap?

399
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:41,425
Teddy, who stopped seeing you

400
00:19:41,425 --> 00:19:43,404
because you were too fat.

401
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,884
He said he didn't have time

402
00:19:46,884 --> 00:19:49,250
for me because of the play.

403
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:51,223
That's what I said.

404
00:19:52,226 --> 00:19:53,824
My point being,

405
00:19:53,824 --> 00:19:55,422
you are no different than the rest.

406
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,828
Wait a minute. Yes, he is.

407
00:19:57,828 --> 00:19:59,426
You are totally different.

408
00:20:00,234 --> 00:20:01,223
In a bad way?

409
00:20:01,335 --> 00:20:02,933
No, in a wonderful way.

410
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:04,531
You know what you want now.

411
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:06,432
Most guys don't know.

412
00:20:07,241 --> 00:20:08,856
You're ready to take risks,

413
00:20:08,856 --> 00:20:10,471
be vulnerable and intimate.

414
00:20:11,245 --> 00:20:12,439
You won't end up alone.

415
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,011
You called Janice. That's how much

416
00:20:16,011 --> 00:20:18,542
you wanted to be with someone.

417
00:20:20,454 --> 00:20:21,421
You've made it.

418
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:22,388
You're there.

419
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:25,356
You are ready to make a commitment.

420
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,451
Don't know about that.

421
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:36,297
What you got there?

422
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:37,933
Something else that's not yours

423
00:20:37,933 --> 00:20:39,463
you can break?

424
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:43,872
I know you like this.

425
00:20:43,872 --> 00:20:45,368
I want you to have it.

426
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:48,472
It'll look good in our apartment.

427
00:20:49,283 --> 00:20:50,477
Thank you.

428
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:58,388
That's fine.

429
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:02,357
You'll be pleased to know

430
00:21:02,357 --> 00:21:04,353
that I have a date tomorrow night.

431
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:07,263
Allison from work. She is great.

432
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:09,359
She's pretty, she's smart.

433
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:11,836
I've been holding off asking her out,

434
00:21:11,836 --> 00:21:17,472
because she has...an unusually large head.

436
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:19,860
But I won't let

437
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,441
that stuff hang me up anymore.

438
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:24,346
Look at me, I'm growing.

439
00:21:25,286 --> 00:21:27,481
You can't recycle yearbooks, can you?

440
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:29,479
I'll take that.

441
00:21:30,257 --> 00:21:31,252
You want his yearbook?

442
00:21:31,252 --> 00:21:32,247
Yeah.

443
00:21:32,293 --> 00:21:33,891
People said nice things.

444
00:21:33,891 --> 00:21:35,489
Somebody should have it.

445
00:21:36,263 --> 00:21:38,356
Gosh, this is so weird.

446
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:40,865
His whole life was in

447
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:43,265
this apartment and now it's gone.

448
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,418
It would be nice if we just

449
00:21:45,418 --> 00:21:47,466
took a few moments for Mr. Heckles.

450
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:50,488
He was kind of a pain.

451
00:21:50,488 --> 00:21:52,467
He was, but he was a person.

452
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:01,217
You're all going to hell.

453
00:22:01,322 --> 00:22:03,347
It's really not that big.

454
00:22:06,427 --> 00:22:07,877
Taking that with you?

455
00:22:07,877 --> 00:22:09,327
Oh, yeah.

456
00:22:15,235 --> 00:22:16,429
Hey, you coming?

457
00:22:17,338 --> 00:22:19,272
Yeah, in a second.

458
00:22:34,455 --> 00:22:36,446
Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.

459
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,251
We'll try to keep it down.

460
00:22:52,373 --> 00:22:53,499
My major was useless.

461
00:22:54,308 --> 00:22:56,304
How often do the classifieds

462
00:22:56,304 --> 00:22:58,300
say ''Philosopher Wanted''?

463
00:22:58,379 --> 00:22:59,505
Sure.

464
00:23:00,247 --> 00:23:02,306
My God, that's a big head.

465
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:05,817
It didn't look this big in the office.

466
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,217
Maybe it's the lighting.

467
00:23:08,322 --> 00:23:09,835
My head must look like

468
00:23:09,835 --> 00:23:11,348
a golf ball at work.

469
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:14,289
Don't get hung up on it.

470
00:23:14,289 --> 00:23:16,319
List five things you like about her.

471
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,364
Nice smile, good dresser.

472
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:21,332
Big head, big head, big head.
