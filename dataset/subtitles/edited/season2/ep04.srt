1
00:00:02,335 --> 00:00:04,235
Mom, would you relax?

2
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:06,334
That was 10 blocks from here,

3
00:00:06,334 --> 00:00:08,364
she was walking alone at night.

4
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:10,340
I would never do that.

5
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:13,275
Mom, come on, stop worrying.

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,910
This is a safe street,

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,440
safe building. Nothing--

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,347
Oh, my God!

9
00:00:18,347 --> 00:00:19,444
What are you doing in here?

10
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:21,283
Mom, I gotta go.

11
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:25,449
Oh, my God.

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,453
That's fine, just read the paper.

13
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,365
I'm gonna get a pot.

14
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,467
It's not for you.

15
00:00:40,273 --> 00:00:42,366
Okay, that's fine.

16
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:49,510
Read the ''Family Circus'' enjoy the gentle comedy....

18
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:54,953
Oh, my God, my God,

19
00:00:54,953 --> 00:00:56,420
my God, my God....

20
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,264
It's open, you guys.

21
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:10,431
Hi.

22
00:01:10,431 --> 00:01:11,426
Hi. Can I help you?

23
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,229
Does Phoebe still live here?

24
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,433
No. I can get a message to her.

25
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:18,010
Great! Just tell her

26
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,477
her husband stopped by.

27
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,372
Her what?

28
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,347
How did you do that?

29
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:17,834
This is unbelievable, Pheebs.

30
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:19,432
How can you be married?

31
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,451
I'm not ''married'' married.

32
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:25,956
He's a friend, and he's gay and he needed a green card.

34
00:02:25,956 --> 00:02:28,436
I can't believe you married Duncan.

35
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,460
How could you not tell me?

36
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,439
We told each other everything.

37
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:35,003
I'm sorry. I knew if I told you,

38
00:02:35,003 --> 00:02:37,454
you'd get judgmental and not approve.

39
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,548
Of course I wouldn't approve.

40
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,790
You were in love with this guy

41
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,287
who was gay. What were you thinking?

42
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:46,882
See? And you thought

43
00:02:46,882 --> 00:02:48,366
she'd be judgmental.

44
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:50,933
I wasn't in love with him.

45
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:52,497
I was helping a friend.

46
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,820
When he left,

47
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,367
you were in your pajamas for a month.

48
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,410
I saw you eat a cheeseburger.

49
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,307
Well, didn't you?

50
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,241
I might have.

51
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,252
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

52
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,818
Like you tell me everything?

53
00:03:10,818 --> 00:03:12,314
What haven't I?

54
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,248
I don't know.

55
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:16,827
The fact that the underwear out

56
00:03:16,827 --> 00:03:21,460
on the telephone pole is yours from sex with Bobby on the terrace.

58
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,259
What?

59
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:25,336
Wait. Who told you?

60
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,375
You are dead meat.

61
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:34,338
I didn't know it was a big secret.

62
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,448
Oh, it's not big. Not at all.

63
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,351
Kind of the same as I don't know,

65
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:42,251
having a third nipple!

66
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,448
You have a third nipple?

67
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,361
You bitch!

68
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,298
Whip it out! Whip it out!

69
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,479
There's nothing to see.

70
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:58,458
It's a tiny bump. It's useless.

71
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:00,756
As opposed to your

72
00:04:00,756 --> 00:04:02,240
multi-functional nipples?

73
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,922
I can't believe you.

74
00:04:04,922 --> 00:04:06,435
You said it was a nubbin.

75
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,347
Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?

76
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,447
You see something, you hear a word,

77
00:04:13,447 --> 00:04:15,443
I thought that was it.

78
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:17,735
Let me see it again.

79
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:19,248
Yes, show us your nubbin.

80
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,258
Joey was in a porno movie.

81
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,948
If I'm going down,

82
00:04:25,948 --> 00:04:27,432
I'm taking everybody.

83
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:30,247
Oh, my God.

84
00:04:30,247 --> 00:04:31,259
You were in a porno?

85
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,337
I was young and I wanted a job.

86
00:04:34,337 --> 00:04:36,436
But I couldn't go through with it.

87
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,359
I was the guy who fixes

88
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:41,764
the copier but can't because there's people

90
00:04:41,764 --> 00:04:43,248
having sex on it.

91
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,443
That is wild!

92
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,282
How's it shaped?

93
00:04:48,282 --> 00:04:49,277
Is it hairy?

94
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,482
What happens if you flick it?

95
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:00,778
So does it do anything,

96
00:05:00,778 --> 00:05:02,291
you know, special?

97
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,353
Pressing my third nipple

98
00:05:04,353 --> 00:05:08,431
opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia.

100
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,390
In some cultures, having a

101
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,438
third nipple is a sign of virility.

102
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,726
You get the best huts,

103
00:05:15,726 --> 00:05:17,239
and women dance naked.

104
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,446
Are any of these cultures,

105
00:05:19,446 --> 00:05:21,442
perchance, in the Tri-State area?

106
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:24,789
You know, you are so amazing.

107
00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:27,223
Is there anything you don't know?

108
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,379
''Julie's so smart!''

109
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:32,330
''Julie's so special!''

110
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,445
Does she put an outfit on at night

111
00:05:34,445 --> 00:05:36,458
and go out and fight crime?

112
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:38,749
I wanted you with Ross

113
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:40,262
as much as you did.

114
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:41,920
But he's with her now.

115
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,467
You'll have to get over it.

116
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,472
Oh, I'm gonna have to get over it.

117
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:50,374
I didn't know that's what I had to do.

118
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,848
I'm gonna have to write that down

119
00:05:53,848 --> 00:05:55,344
on my hand.

120
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,287
Sassy lady!

121
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:01,282
Where are you going?

122
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,294
To meet Duncan.

123
00:06:03,294 --> 00:06:05,194
He's skating tonight at the Garden.

124
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,232
He's in the Capades.

125
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:09,851
The Ice Capades?

126
00:06:09,851 --> 00:06:11,301
No, the Gravel Capades.

127
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,235
The turns aren't as fast,

128
00:06:15,235 --> 00:06:17,231
but when Snoopy falls, funny.

129
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,877
I can't believe you dressed up.

130
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:22,311
You're setting yourself up again.

131
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:24,213
Okay, no.

132
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,317
For your information, I'm seeing him

133
00:06:27,317 --> 00:06:29,416
to put those feelings behind me.

134
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:31,838
The reason I'm dressed like this

135
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:36,421
is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband.

137
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,356
Darn it, we're all out of milk.

138
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:43,266
Chandler, would you fill me up here?

139
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,493
I see, I see.

140
00:06:51,493 --> 00:06:53,444
Because of the third-nipple thing.

141
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,278
Sweetie, I'll see you later.

142
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,886
See you later, Rach.

143
00:07:05,886 --> 00:07:07,382
Bye-bye, Julie.

144
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,235
Come on, cut it out.

145
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,274
Hey.

146
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:23,241
What?

147
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,356
Can I ask you something?

148
00:07:25,356 --> 00:07:26,402
Sure.

149
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:29,439
What?

150
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,946
Come on, talk to me.

151
00:07:31,946 --> 00:07:33,442
Okay.

152
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:36,733
What's the longest you've been

153
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:43,260
in a relationship before...having the sex?

155
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,780
Why? Who's not--?

156
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,230
Are you and Julie not--?

157
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,325
You and Julie not having sex?

158
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,468
Technically? No.

159
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:00,210
Is it because she's so cold in bed?

160
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,362
Or because she's kind of bossy,

161
00:08:03,362 --> 00:08:05,410
makes it feel like school?

162
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,753
No! She's great. It's not like

163
00:08:08,753 --> 00:08:11,187
we haven't done anything.

164
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,241
We do plenty of other stuff.

165
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:15,192
Lots of other stuff like--

166
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,489
No! Don't need to know the details.

167
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,229
No, it's just....

168
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,231
It's me.

169
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,832
I've only been with

170
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:29,431
one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian.

172
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,856
So now I've got myself

173
00:08:31,856 --> 00:08:33,403
all psyched out.

174
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:39,315
It's become, like, this...this thing!

176
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,218
You must just think I'm weird.

177
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,258
No, I don't think it's weird.

178
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,453
I think, in fact....

179
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,326
In fact, you know what I think?

180
00:08:51,326 --> 00:08:52,423
What?

181
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,232
I think it's sexy.

182
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:57,358
Sexy?

183
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,337
Let me tell you something.

184
00:09:00,337 --> 00:09:04,890
As a woman, there is nothing sexier than a man who does not

186
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,471
want to have sex.

187
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,677
No kidding?

188
00:09:10,677 --> 00:09:13,174
You know what I'd do? I'd wait.

189
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,716
You'd wait?

190
00:09:15,716 --> 00:09:19,324
Absolutely. I would wait and wait....

192
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,385
Then I'd wait some more.

193
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,386
Really?

194
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,461
I don't care if she says

195
00:09:27,461 --> 00:09:31,834
she wants it, she begs, she pleads she tells you she's gonna

197
00:09:31,834 --> 00:09:33,432
have sex with another man--

198
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,401
That just means it's working.

199
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,304
Women really want this?

200
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,314
More than jewelry.

201
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,267
Phoebe!

202
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,331
Look at you! You look great.

203
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,466
Do I? Thank you.

204
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:12,407
So do you. Sparkly.

205
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:13,470
Thanks.

206
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,815
This is pretty wonderful,

207
00:10:20,815 --> 00:10:22,379
Mr. Major Capades Guy.

208
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,924
I remember when you were just King

209
00:10:25,924 --> 00:10:28,392
Friday in Mr. Rogers' Ice Is Nice.

210
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,486
You always said I'd make it.

211
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,562
Well, I'm kind of spooky that way.

212
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,493
Gosh, I missed you.

213
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,003
I'm gonna get changed.

214
00:10:43,003 --> 00:10:44,499
Okay.

215
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,377
Now.

216
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,474
Oh! Right. Okay.

217
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,375
Olé!

218
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,276
What?

219
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,288
The Matador....

220
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,321
Olé!

221
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,785
Sweetie, can you

222
00:11:10,785 --> 00:11:12,235
hold this for a second?

223
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:20,809
Julie?

224
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:21,372
Yeah.

225
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,844
Sorry, you had a

226
00:11:23,844 --> 00:11:25,340
paleontologist on your face.

227
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,282
It's gone now. You're all right.

228
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,254
Hi, everyone.

229
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,391
I wanted to thank you

230
00:11:34,391 --> 00:11:36,291
for our little talk before.

231
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,926
No problem. So you're going

232
00:11:37,926 --> 00:11:39,490
with the waiting thing?

233
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:41,830
I was going to, but after you,

234
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,394
I talked to Joey.

235
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:50,375
Good. What did he say?

236
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:51,859
He told me to get over myself

237
00:11:51,859 --> 00:11:53,309
and do it.

238
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,776
I thought about what you said

239
00:11:55,776 --> 00:11:57,272
and he said.

240
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,812
And his way,

241
00:11:58,812 --> 00:12:00,308
I get to have sex tonight, so....

242
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,420
What is this in my pocket?

243
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,355
Why, it's Joey's porno movie.

244
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,259
Pop it in.

245
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,818
I'm fine, if you're okay watching a

246
00:12:20,818 --> 00:12:23,366
video filled with two-nippled people.

247
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:29,280
People having sex. Just what I need.

248
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,441
What's wrong with people having sex?

249
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,820
Well, you know,

250
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:41,406
these movies are offensive and degrading

252
00:12:41,406 --> 00:12:43,454
to women and females....

253
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:46,977
And the lighting's

254
00:12:46,977 --> 00:12:48,490
always unflattering.

255
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:52,950
Monica, help me out here.

256
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,497
Hell, I wanna see Joey!

257
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,443
So is there a story?

258
00:13:03,443 --> 00:13:05,439
Or do they just start doing it right--?

259
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,514
Oh. Never mind.

260
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,884
Wait. That is the craziest

261
00:13:09,884 --> 00:13:11,448
typing test I've ever seen.

262
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,223
I say, she'd better get the job.

263
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,792
Looks to me like he's

264
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:19,322
the one getting the job.

265
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,459
Here I come.

266
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,463
I come to fix the copier.

267
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,319
I can't get to the copier.

268
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:29,367
I'm thinking, ''What do I do?''

269
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:33,240
So I just watch them have sex.

270
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,247
Wait. Here's my line.

271
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,814
You know, that's bad

272
00:13:39,814 --> 00:13:41,344
for the paper tray.

273
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,481
Nice work, my friend.

274
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,872
You see me again.

275
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:48,487
Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.

276
00:13:50,362 --> 00:13:51,926
There I am. There I am.

277
00:13:51,926 --> 00:13:53,490
There I am....

278
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,736
So, what's up?

279
00:14:02,736 --> 00:14:04,232
You came to see me yesterday.

280
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,308
I kind of need a divorce.

281
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:15,352
Okay.

282
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,450
How come?

283
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,225
Actually, I'm getting married again.

284
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,316
What?

285
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,419
I don't know how to say this.

286
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,426
I'm straight.

287
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:34,371
I don't understand.

288
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:36,271
How can you be straight?

289
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,907
You're so smart and funny and you

290
00:14:38,907 --> 00:14:41,472
throw great Academy Award parties.

291
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,375
That's what I kept telling myself.

292
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,401
You reach a point

293
00:14:46,401 --> 00:14:48,352
where you can't live a lie anymore.

294
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,447
How long have you known?

295
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,923
I guess on some level

296
00:14:54,923 --> 00:14:56,487
I always knew I was straight.

297
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,229
I was supposed to be something else.

298
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,364
I'm an ice dancer, all my friends

299
00:15:02,364 --> 00:15:04,429
are gay. I was trying to fit in.

300
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,437
And there's actually a woman?

301
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,439
Her name's Debra.

302
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,811
Well, is she the first

303
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:19,307
that you've been with?

304
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:26,291
I've never told you this...but there were one

306
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:29,777
or two times back in college I'd get drunk,

308
00:15:29,777 --> 00:15:33,423
go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman.

310
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,348
I told myself it was the liquor,

311
00:15:36,348 --> 00:15:38,430
and people experiment in college.

312
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,328
Sure.

313
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,352
Now I know I don't have a choice.

314
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:45,331
I was born this way.

315
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,245
I don't know what to say.

316
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,346
You're married for six years

317
00:15:53,346 --> 00:15:55,342
and you think you know him.

318
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:56,871
And then one day he says,

319
00:15:56,871 --> 00:15:58,355
''Oh, I'm not gay!''

320
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:05,420
I'm still me.

321
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,350
Why couldn't you have figured

322
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,301
this out six years ago?

323
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,333
It still smells like monkey in there.

324
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,236
That saves us the conversation.

325
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:25,410
This has been great, but I'm wiped.

326
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:28,243
Me too. We should get going.

327
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,221
No! Come on, you guys.

328
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,417
Come on, it's only 1 1 :30.

329
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:37,223
Let's just talk. We never just

330
00:16:37,223 --> 00:16:39,219
hang out and talk anymore.

331
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,458
Rachel, that's all we do.

332
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,802
Maybe that's all we do.

333
00:16:44,802 --> 00:16:46,269
What about Julie?

334
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:49,238
What about Julie?

335
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:51,354
You have been in our lives

336
00:16:51,354 --> 00:16:55,470
for nearly two months now and we don't really know you.

338
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,728
I mean, who is Julie?

339
00:16:58,728 --> 00:17:01,208
What do you like? What don't you like?

340
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,379
We want to know everything.

341
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,413
That could take a while.

342
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,383
So?

343
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,792
Who here does not have

344
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:12,390
the time to get to know Julie?

345
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:15,264
I got time to get to know Julie.

346
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:18,348
I know her pretty well.

347
00:17:18,348 --> 00:17:19,394
Can I go?

348
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:23,397
That's fine.

349
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,807
Let's start with your childhood.

350
00:17:25,807 --> 00:17:27,405
What was that like?

351
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:30,211
In a nutshell--

352
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,253
So, have you told your parents?

353
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:38,940
No, but it'll be okay.

354
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,424
They're pretty cool.

355
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,285
My brother's straight, so....

356
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,226
Here you go.

357
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:47,765
You know what?

358
00:17:47,765 --> 00:17:49,232
I have one more question.

359
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,802
If you had figured this out sooner,

360
00:17:51,802 --> 00:17:55,823
and I had been around do you think

362
00:17:55,823 --> 00:17:57,307
I would have been the one...?

363
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,267
No. Don't tell me.

364
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,876
I don't think either answer

365
00:18:02,876 --> 00:18:05,373
would make me feel better. Here.

366
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,480
I love you, Phoebe.

367
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,397
So your brother's straight, huh?

368
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,204
Seriously.

369
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,923
-and my second-grade teacher

370
00:18:32,923 --> 00:18:36,329
was Miss Thomas my first-grade teacher

372
00:18:36,329 --> 00:18:37,444
was Mrs. Cobb.

373
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,248
Mrs. Gobb?

374
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:43,219
No, Cobb. Like cobb salad.

375
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,317
What exactly is in a cobb salad?

376
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,224
I'm going home.

377
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,269
Boy, that Julie's a talker, huh?

378
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:00,405
Good night.

379
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,740
It's late. You're probably

380
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,304
not still planning on....

381
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,177
No, I am.

382
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,309
Are you nervous?

383
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,416
I have done it before.

384
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:21,385
I mean, how are you gonna handle it?

385
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,422
Will you talk about it beforehand?

386
00:19:23,422 --> 00:19:25,418
Will you just pounce?

387
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,864
I don't know.

388
00:19:27,864 --> 00:19:32,295
I guess I'm just gonna see what happens.

390
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,339
Good luck.

391
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,199
What?

392
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,436
Nothing....

393
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,711
It is your first time with her, and if

394
00:19:44,711 --> 00:19:49,287
the first time doesn't go well well, then, that's pretty darn

396
00:19:49,287 --> 00:19:51,255
hard to recover from.

397
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,316
Okay, now I'm nervous.

398
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,229
Maybe you should put it off.

399
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:03,324
No, I don't want to put it off.

400
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,305
I spent last year being

401
00:20:08,305 --> 00:20:10,239
so unbelievably miserable.

402
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:13,277
And now I'm actually happy.

403
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,272
You know, I mean really happy.

404
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:19,383
I just don't wanna....

405
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,447
I don't wanna mess it up, you know?

406
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,285
I know.

407
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,454
I'm sorry.

408
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,263
It's not your fault.

409
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:34,491
Right.

410
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,897
Maybe it doesn't

411
00:20:37,897 --> 00:20:39,393
have to be this tough.

412
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:42,001
Maybe you were on the right track

413
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:44,498
with that whole ''spontaneous'' thing.

414
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,873
Women really like that.

415
00:20:46,873 --> 00:20:48,369
Really?

416
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:52,914
I mean if it were me,

417
00:20:52,914 --> 00:20:54,512
I'd want you to....

418
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,918
I don't know, catch me off guard

419
00:20:56,918 --> 00:21:00,515
with a really good kiss.

421
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:07,421
Really sort of soft at first.

422
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,930
And then maybe brush

423
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,427
the hair away from my face.

424
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:19,910
And then look far into my eyes in a way that lets me

426
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:24,440
know something...amazing is about to happen.

428
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,876
And then, I don't know, then you'd pull me

430
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:38,378
really close to you so that I'd be pressed up

432
00:21:38,378 --> 00:21:40,295
right against you.

433
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:51,501
And it would get kind of...sweaty...and blurry.

436
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:57,277
And then it's just happening.

437
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,348
Thanks, Rach. Good night.

438
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,229
Oh, God!

439
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,277
Good morning!

440
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:34,344
Well, somebody got some last night.

441
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,252
Twice!
