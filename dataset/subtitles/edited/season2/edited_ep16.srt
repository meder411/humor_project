1
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:08,356
This is weird. Ever notice Cap'n Crunch's eyebrows are on his hat?

2
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:14,392
That's weird? The man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years.

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,329
What?

4
00:00:18,407 --> 00:00:21,308
The spoon! You licked and you put.

5
00:00:23,446 --> 00:00:26,244
You licked and you put.

6
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:27,407
Yeah, so?

7
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,410
Don't you see how gross that is? It's like you using my toothbrush.

8
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:35,322
You used my toothbrush!

9
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:40,218
Only because I used the red one to unclog the drain.

10
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:43,262
Mine is the red one!

11
00:00:43,332 --> 00:00:48,360
Oh, God! Can open. Worms everywhere!

12
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:53,368
Why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?

13
00:00:53,476 --> 00:00:57,378
Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.

14
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:05,219
Next time you shower think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash.

16
00:01:55,371 --> 00:01:59,432
Look at you fancy lads! What's the occasion?

17
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:03,172
You know that guy on my show that's in a coma?

18
00:02:03,312 --> 00:02:05,371
He's having a brunch.

19
00:02:06,315 --> 00:02:07,748
Ready when you are.

20
00:02:07,748 --> 00:02:09,181
Okey-doke.

21
00:02:09,285 --> 00:02:12,186
I can't believe you're getting tattoos.

22
00:02:12,221 --> 00:02:14,189
You guys are getting tattoos?

23
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,384
Yes, but you cannot tell Ross. I wanna surprise him.

24
00:02:18,194 --> 00:02:20,389
Wow, this is wild! What are you gonna get?

25
00:02:21,297 --> 00:02:23,390
I'm getting a lily.

26
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:27,225
For my mom, because her name's Lily.

27
00:02:27,436 --> 00:02:32,203
That's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?

28
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:34,272
Where you getting it?

29
00:02:34,272 --> 00:02:35,335
My shoulder.

30
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:38,403
What? What's on your shoulder?

31
00:02:39,215 --> 00:02:41,206
A chip.

32
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:45,420
I've got a big attitude problem.

33
00:02:46,322 --> 00:02:47,818
A tattoo. I'm getting a tattoo.

34
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:49,314
A tattoo?

35
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:52,417
Why? Why would you wanna do that?

36
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:55,442
You don't think they're kind of cool?

37
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:57,455
No. Sorry, I don't.

38
00:02:58,234 --> 00:03:01,203
Why would anyone pay to scar their body for life?

39
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,363
What if it doesn't come out right?

40
00:03:03,405 --> 00:03:07,273
It's like having a bad haircut all the time.

41
00:03:08,377 --> 00:03:11,210
Why is everyone staring at me?

42
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,306
Sign this card for Dad. Richard will be here soon.

43
00:03:14,383 --> 00:03:16,334
He's going to the party?

44
00:03:16,334 --> 00:03:18,285
He's my parents' best friend.

45
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:21,481
So is today the day you tell them about you two?

46
00:03:22,224 --> 00:03:26,388
Yeah, for my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke.

47
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:29,322
No, I think you should tell them.

48
00:03:29,398 --> 00:03:33,198
I don't know how serious he is. Until I do, I say nothing.

49
00:03:33,302 --> 00:03:35,395
I don't think Mom and Dad would mind.

50
00:03:35,437 --> 00:03:39,305
Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, Dad said:

51
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:41,502
''God, I hope they get together.''

52
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:48,339
-Hello?
-I'm double-parked.

53
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:50,248
Okay. Come on, Ross.

54
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:54,888
Bye, you.

55
00:03:54,888 --> 00:03:56,321
Bye.

56
00:04:01,363 --> 00:04:03,354
Bye, you.

57
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:18,378
Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. Okay, wait, wait.

58
00:04:19,381 --> 00:04:21,281
It's gonna be fine.

59
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:23,181
Are you not nervous?

60
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:26,416
I'm terrified. This is just a very absorbent suit.

61
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:28,184
Shall we?

62
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,179
Yes.

63
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:30,419
No. You know what?

64
00:04:31,193 --> 00:04:34,287
Ross, let's switch places. Get in the middle.

65
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,424
This looks like we're trying to cover something up.

66
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,296
You could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it.

67
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,298
We're here!

68
00:04:45,407 --> 00:04:48,399
Hi, kids! Hi, darling!

69
00:04:48,444 --> 00:04:49,928
Happy birthday, Dad.

70
00:04:49,928 --> 00:04:51,412
Thank you.

71
00:04:51,447 --> 00:04:52,436
Happy birthday!

72
00:04:53,215 --> 00:04:55,410
You kids thanked Dr. Burke for the ride?

73
00:04:55,451 --> 00:05:00,252
Actually, Mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us.

74
00:05:01,257 --> 00:05:03,248
So you kids take the train in?

75
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,192
No, Richard Burke gave them a ride.

76
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:12,258
Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.

77
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:20,308
Finger cramp! Oh, God! Sorry. Here, let me get that, Mom.

78
00:05:20,376 --> 00:05:25,404
So Richard's shopping in the junior section?

79
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:27,375
Are we still on that?

80
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:31,409
You just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.

81
00:05:32,187 --> 00:05:34,178
She's probably not even pretty.

82
00:05:34,223 --> 00:05:38,182
Just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.

83
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:47,301
Can you believe this?

84
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:49,201
It's a great apartment.

85
00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:52,297
In the bathroom, there's mirrors on both sides.

86
00:05:52,408 --> 00:05:55,400
It's like peeing with the Rockettes.

87
00:05:56,245 --> 00:05:59,214
Well, there's my fantasy come true.

88
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:01,249
No, seriously.

89
00:06:02,284 --> 00:06:04,314
We were just saying, great apartment!

90
00:06:04,314 --> 00:06:06,344
Thanks. You want it?

91
00:06:06,388 --> 00:06:10,256
I'm moving to a bigger place. You should take this one.

92
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,673
Can you see me in a place like this?

93
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,186
Why not?

94
00:06:14,263 --> 00:06:19,257
You hate park views and high ceilings? Come on, I'll show you the kitchen.

95
00:06:20,302 --> 00:06:23,203
That's okay, I saw a kitchen this morning.

96
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:26,400
On TV. Stop talking. Okay!

97
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,256
Come on, tell us!

98
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,302
Is she really 20?

99
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:32,370
I am not telling you anything.

100
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:36,281
Come on, it's my birthday. Let me live vicariously!

101
00:06:36,318 --> 00:06:38,309
You don't want to do that.

102
00:06:38,387 --> 00:06:41,379
What's a little midlife crisis between friends?

103
00:06:41,423 --> 00:06:42,822
Let it go.

104
00:06:42,822 --> 00:06:44,221
I know what it's like.

105
00:06:44,293 --> 00:06:49,424
When I turned 50, I got the Porsche. You got your own little speedster.

106
00:06:50,232 --> 00:06:51,779
Seriously, it's not like that.

107
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,326
Tell you what.

108
00:06:53,402 --> 00:06:57,236
Maybe one weekend you can borrow the car and I could--

109
00:06:57,306 --> 00:06:59,501
I beg you not to finish that sentence!

110
00:07:00,175 --> 00:07:02,143
What? I'm kidding!

111
00:07:02,244 --> 00:07:05,338
You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.

112
00:07:12,354 --> 00:07:17,257
Okay, Rach. Which lily? This lily or that lily?

113
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,206
Well, I--

114
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:20,252
I like this lily.

115
00:07:20,295 --> 00:07:25,460
It's more open. That's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit.

116
00:07:26,268 --> 00:07:28,293
Foghorn Leghorn!

117
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:35,275
Blond girl? You're in room two. Not-so-blond girl, you're with me.

118
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,278
Here we go!

119
00:07:38,213 --> 00:07:40,181
You're not going.

120
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:43,231
Is this because of what Ross said?

121
00:07:43,231 --> 00:07:45,279
No.

122
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:46,871
Well, yeah, maybe.

123
00:07:46,871 --> 00:07:48,321
I don't believe this.

124
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:53,327
Is this how this relationship is gonna work? Ross equals boss?

125
00:07:53,395 --> 00:07:56,193
Come on, what is this, 1 922?

126
00:07:56,331 --> 00:07:58,196
What's 1 922?

127
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,131
Just, you know, a long time ago.

128
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:05,331
When men used to tell women what to do a lot.

129
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:10,134
Then there was suffrage, which was good. But it sounds horrible.

130
00:08:13,148 --> 00:08:14,746
Do you want this tattoo?

131
00:08:14,746 --> 00:08:16,344
I do. It's just that Ross--

132
00:08:16,385 --> 00:08:21,152
Okay, hey! Is your boyfriend the boss of you?

133
00:08:21,356 --> 00:08:22,823
No.

134
00:08:22,823 --> 00:08:24,290
Okay, who is the boss of you?

135
00:08:26,161 --> 00:08:27,253
You?

136
00:08:28,163 --> 00:08:30,393
No! You are the boss of you!

137
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:36,263
You march in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip! Go!

138
00:08:39,274 --> 00:08:43,210
I haven't even gotten my tattoo and I'm already tougher.

139
00:08:48,183 --> 00:08:49,207
How you doing?

140
00:08:49,284 --> 00:08:51,377
I'm a twinkie!

141
00:08:52,187 --> 00:08:54,417
Really? I'm a hero.

142
00:08:57,192 --> 00:08:58,420
This is so hard.

143
00:08:59,194 --> 00:09:02,163
Yeah, I know. I hate it too.

144
00:09:02,231 --> 00:09:05,132
Look, maybe we should just tell them.

145
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:08,226
Maybe we should just tell your parents first.

146
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,170
My parents are dead.

147
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,175
God, you are so lucky!

148
00:09:15,244 --> 00:09:16,694
I mean-- You know what I mean.

149
00:09:16,694 --> 00:09:18,144
I know.

150
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:20,340
Just hang in there, okay?

151
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:22,765
Okay, I'll go out first, all right?

152
00:09:22,765 --> 00:09:25,148
All right.

153
00:09:29,157 --> 00:09:32,251
Judy! Going to the bathroom. Good for you!

154
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:39,461
Thank you, Richard. I appreciate the support.

155
00:09:43,272 --> 00:09:48,266
Honey. Seen my Harmon Killebrew bat? Bob won't believe I have one.

156
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:50,175
I have no idea.

157
00:09:50,312 --> 00:09:54,180
Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?

158
00:09:54,283 --> 00:09:58,379
I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.

159
00:09:59,187 --> 00:10:02,281
I never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.

160
00:10:02,324 --> 00:10:06,226
He told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl.

161
00:10:06,295 --> 00:10:09,196
He said he's falling in love with her.

162
00:10:09,298 --> 00:10:10,748
Really?

163
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:12,198
I've never seen him this happy.

164
00:10:12,234 --> 00:10:16,398
So, Jack. Ever think about trading me in for a younger model?

165
00:10:16,505 --> 00:10:19,201
Of course not.

166
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:23,301
With you, it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.

167
00:10:26,315 --> 00:10:28,215
Oh, Jack, stop!

168
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,218
Come on!

169
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:33,445
It's my birthday!

170
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:41,420
Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.

171
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:46,433
Please. I saw the way you were checking out his moldings. You want it.

172
00:10:46,535 --> 00:10:51,370
Why would I want another apartment? I've already got one I love.

173
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,240
It wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.

174
00:10:57,446 --> 00:11:02,315
All right. You want the truth? I'm thinking about it.

175
00:11:02,384 --> 00:11:03,334
What?

176
00:11:03,334 --> 00:11:04,284
I'm sorry.

177
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:13,326
I'm 28. I've never lived alone and I'm finally at a place where I got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore.

179
00:11:13,395 --> 00:11:18,332
I don't need a roommate either. I can afford to live here by myself.

180
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,201
I may have to bring in somebody every week to lick the silverware.

181
00:11:23,305 --> 00:11:28,299
Why are you so bent out of shape? We didn't agree to live together forever.

182
00:11:28,343 --> 00:11:30,436
We're not Bert and Ernie.

183
00:11:32,314 --> 00:11:36,410
I'm aware that we're not gay puppets, all right?

184
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:38,343
You know what?

185
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:43,323
If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it.

186
00:11:43,358 --> 00:11:44,387
That's how I feel.

187
00:11:44,387 --> 00:11:45,416
Then take it!

188
00:11:46,228 --> 00:11:46,774
Maybe I will!

189
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:47,320
Fine!

190
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:53,425
Great! You can spend more time with your real friends, the spoons!

191
00:11:54,336 --> 00:11:57,237
Whose drink can I freshen?

192
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,367
Almost time for cake!

193
00:12:10,385 --> 00:12:12,285
Mon, are you okay?

194
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,381
You remember that video I found of Mom and Dad?

195
00:12:17,192 --> 00:12:19,422
Well, I just caught the live show.

196
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,212
Hey, there.

197
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,224
What?

198
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:31,395
Nothing. I just heard something nice about you.

199
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:34,204
Really?

200
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:35,333
Richard?

201
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,878
Your son isn't seeing anyone, is he?

202
00:12:37,878 --> 00:12:40,346
Not that I know of.

203
00:12:40,415 --> 00:12:45,409
I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?

204
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:49,424
That's an idea.

205
00:12:49,524 --> 00:12:53,221
Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone.

206
00:12:53,328 --> 00:12:54,317
Oh?

207
00:12:58,366 --> 00:13:03,167
She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know she's seeing someone?

208
00:13:03,205 --> 00:13:06,470
Mom, there are so many people in my life.

209
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:12,203
Some of them are seeing people and some aren't. Is that crystal?

210
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:16,284
So who's the mystery man?

211
00:13:17,185 --> 00:13:19,278
Well, he's a doctor.

212
00:13:19,387 --> 00:13:21,184
A real doctor?

213
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:23,382
No, a doctor of meat.

214
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:28,194
Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome.

215
00:13:29,197 --> 00:13:31,392
And he's sweet, and I know you'd like him.

216
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,497
Well, that's wonderful.

217
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,199
Mom, it's okay.

218
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,407
It is, Judy.

219
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:44,504
Jack!

220
00:13:46,448 --> 00:13:51,215
Could you come in here for a moment? Now!

221
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,420
Found it!

222
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,320
I'll take that, Dad.

223
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,356
It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.

224
00:14:03,265 --> 00:14:07,167
That's impossible. He's got a twinkie in the city.

225
00:14:07,402 --> 00:14:09,199
I'm the twinkie.

226
00:14:09,404 --> 00:14:10,433
You are?

227
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:11,462
She's not a twinkie!

228
00:14:12,307 --> 00:14:15,367
Look, this is the best relationship I've been in--

229
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:18,174
Oh, please! A relationship?

230
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,216
Yes, a relationship! I am crazy about this man.

231
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:23,813
Really?

232
00:14:23,813 --> 00:14:25,309
Yes.

233
00:14:25,387 --> 00:14:29,414
Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?

234
00:14:30,192 --> 00:14:34,288
This is a good thing. You said you've never seen Richard happier.

235
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:35,318
When?

236
00:14:35,397 --> 00:14:39,493
Upstairs in the bathroom, right before you felt up Mom!

237
00:14:57,319 --> 00:15:00,345
It looks so good! Oh, I love it.

238
00:15:00,388 --> 00:15:04,154
I know, so do I. I'm so glad you made me do this.

239
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:06,352
Okay, let me see yours.

240
00:15:09,264 --> 00:15:11,289
Let's see yours again.

241
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:14,280
We just saw mine. Let me see yours.

242
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,293
Oh, okay.

243
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:19,269
Oh, no!

244
00:15:20,308 --> 00:15:25,405
It's gone! That's so weird. I don't know where it went.

245
00:15:28,183 --> 00:15:29,246
You didn't get it?

246
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:30,309
No.

247
00:15:30,485 --> 00:15:31,901
Why not?

248
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:33,317
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

249
00:15:33,388 --> 00:15:36,289
How could you do this? This was your idea!

250
00:15:36,324 --> 00:15:40,317
I know! I was gonna get it, but he came in with this needle.

251
00:15:40,395 --> 00:15:44,195
Did you know they do this with needles?

252
00:15:44,232 --> 00:15:46,200
Really? You don't say?

253
00:15:46,234 --> 00:15:49,397
Because mine was licked on by kittens!

254
00:15:50,305 --> 00:15:53,399
I'm sorry. Seriously, does it hurt a lot?

255
00:15:53,441 --> 00:15:57,241
No, it's just a pinch. Like that--

256
00:15:57,312 --> 00:15:59,212
Oh, my God!

257
00:16:00,181 --> 00:16:03,344
That really hurt me! Oh, that's gonna leave a mark.

258
00:16:08,356 --> 00:16:10,187
I'm sorry about what--

259
00:16:10,258 --> 00:16:11,725
Yeah, me too.

260
00:16:11,725 --> 00:16:13,192
I know.

261
00:16:15,397 --> 00:16:18,264
So do we need to hug here?

262
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,393
No, we're all right.

263
00:16:22,203 --> 00:16:24,171
So I got you something.

264
00:16:25,173 --> 00:16:26,265
Plastic spoons!

265
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,293
Great!

266
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:32,176
Lick away, my man.

267
00:16:32,314 --> 00:16:36,410
These will go great in my new place, till I get real ones.

268
00:16:37,185 --> 00:16:38,277
What?

269
00:16:38,386 --> 00:16:42,379
I can't use these forever. They're no friend of the environment.

270
00:16:43,224 --> 00:16:46,216
No, I mean what's this about your new place?

271
00:16:46,428 --> 00:16:48,879
I'm moving out, like we talked about.

272
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:51,330
I didn't think that was serious.

273
00:16:52,434 --> 00:16:55,335
I thought that was just a fight.

274
00:16:55,403 --> 00:16:59,430
Well, it was a fight. Based on serious stuff, remember?

275
00:17:00,175 --> 00:17:02,166
About how I never lived alone?

276
00:17:02,243 --> 00:17:07,375
I think it would be good for me. Help me to grow or whatever.

278
00:17:11,186 --> 00:17:13,279
Well, there you go.

279
00:17:14,356 --> 00:17:18,383
Are you cool with this? I don't wanna leave you high and dry.

280
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,152
I've never been lower or wetter.

281
00:17:23,298 --> 00:17:27,257
I'll be fine. I'll just turn your bedroom into a game room.

282
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:30,202
Put the foosball table in there.

283
00:17:31,373 --> 00:17:34,240
Why do you get to keep the table?

284
00:17:36,311 --> 00:17:38,472
I did pay for half of it.

285
00:17:41,383 --> 00:17:43,897
And I paid for the other half.

286
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:46,411
All right, I'll play you for it.

287
00:17:47,188 --> 00:17:48,280
All right, you're on.

288
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:52,292
I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass.

289
00:17:52,494 --> 00:17:56,430
Your men will get scored on more times than your sister.

290
00:18:03,438 --> 00:18:05,235
Which sister?

291
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:11,209
So are you sorry that I told them?

292
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,375
No. It's been a long time since your dad and I went running.

293
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:20,382
Did you get it?

294
00:18:20,382 --> 00:18:21,377
Is Ross here?

295
00:18:22,157 --> 00:18:23,670
He went out for pizza.

296
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,183
Okay, really quick.

297
00:18:26,294 --> 00:18:27,727
That's great!

298
00:18:27,727 --> 00:18:29,160
Very tasteful.

299
00:18:30,165 --> 00:18:31,160
Wanna see mine?

300
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,155
Yes.

301
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,168
What? You didn't get one.

302
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:37,261
Okay. Well then, what is this?

303
00:18:39,174 --> 00:18:41,199
What are we looking at?

304
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:43,402
That blue freckle?

305
00:18:44,412 --> 00:18:46,209
That's my tattoo.

306
00:18:46,281 --> 00:18:49,182
That is not a tattoo. That is a nothing.

307
00:18:49,317 --> 00:18:55,185
I got her in the chair, he barely touched her she screamed and that was it.

309
00:18:55,223 --> 00:18:57,191
Okay, hi!

310
00:18:58,426 --> 00:19:03,159
For your information, this is exactly what I wanted.

311
00:19:03,231 --> 00:19:08,328
This is a tattoo of the Earth as seen from a great, great distance.

312
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:12,333
It's the way my mother sees me from heaven.

313
00:19:12,373 --> 00:19:15,274
Oh, what a load of crap!

314
00:19:17,145 --> 00:19:18,271
That is a dot!

315
00:19:18,346 --> 00:19:23,283
Your mother's in heaven going, ''Where the hell's my lily, you wuss?!''

316
00:19:24,352 --> 00:19:30,188
Okay? That is not a tattoo! This is a tattoo!

317
00:19:33,161 --> 00:19:34,355
You got a tattoo?

318
00:19:36,164 --> 00:19:37,256
Maybe.

319
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:41,359
But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world!

320
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:45,296
Well, let me see.

321
00:19:48,276 --> 00:19:49,402
Well?

322
00:19:50,178 --> 00:19:54,374
Well, it's really...sexy.

324
00:19:54,415 --> 00:19:59,379
I wouldn't have thought it would be, but wow!

326
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,803
Really?

327
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:08,385
Yeah. So is it sore? Or can you do stuff?

329
00:20:11,332 --> 00:20:13,232
I guess.

330
00:20:13,301 --> 00:20:15,428
Save us some pizza.

331
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:23,504
Get it out of the corner!

332
00:20:24,412 --> 00:20:25,401
Pass it! Pass it!

333
00:20:26,314 --> 00:20:28,305
Stop talking to your men!

334
00:20:30,451 --> 00:20:33,352
And the table is mine.

335
00:20:36,424 --> 00:20:39,222
Congratulations.

336
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:53,332
You guys will still visit, right?

337
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:58,276
Oh, yeah. You got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time.

338
00:20:58,379 --> 00:21:00,370
Except when we are here.

339
00:21:05,286 --> 00:21:09,188
I know you're just moving uptown, but I'll miss you.

340
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,383
How can you not be across the hall?

341
00:21:12,193 --> 00:21:16,186
Who's gonna eat all our food and tie up our phone lines--?

342
00:21:16,297 --> 00:21:18,390
Is that my bra?

343
00:21:20,301 --> 00:21:22,269
What are you doing with my bra?

344
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:24,237
It's not what you think.

345
00:21:24,305 --> 00:21:28,332
We used it to fling water balloons off the roof.

346
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:33,210
Remember? Those kids couldn't even get theirs across the street.

347
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:35,239
Yeah, I remember.

348
00:21:37,218 --> 00:21:40,415
Let's bring the rest of these down to the truck.

349
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:57,270
You want me to give you a hand with the foosball table?

351
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:01,172
You keep it. You need the practice.

352
00:22:03,311 --> 00:22:05,279
Thanks.

353
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,372
So I guess this is it.

354
00:22:09,284 --> 00:22:12,412
Yeah, right. Yeah. I guess so.

355
00:22:14,422 --> 00:22:18,381
Listen, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again.

356
00:22:18,426 --> 00:22:21,190
Tonight, at the coffeehouse.

357
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:24,231
Right. Yeah. Okay.

358
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:25,815
Take care.

359
00:22:25,815 --> 00:22:27,231
Yeah.
