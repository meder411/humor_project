1
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:09,538
Hold on a second.

2
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,337
Nice. Nice.

3
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:16,847
Something for you.

4
00:00:16,847 --> 00:00:18,246
What's this?

5
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,251
81 2 bucks.

6
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,935
Didn't Big Leon tell you? It's a

7
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:25,483
thousand if you want me for the night.

8
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:27,806
What is this for?

9
00:00:27,806 --> 00:00:29,353
Well, I'm making money now.

10
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:32,394
I'm paying you back for headshots,

11
00:00:32,394 --> 00:00:35,392
electric bills, pizza-- Love you, man.

12
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:37,481
Well, thanks, man.

13
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:39,494
Now I can get my pony.

14
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:42,388
This is a little extra something

15
00:00:42,388 --> 00:00:44,470
for always being there for me.

16
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,573
Wow! I don't know what to say.

17
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:56,478
Wow! I don't know what to say.

18
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,405
What do you say?

19
00:00:58,405 --> 00:00:59,520
I don't know.

20
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,353
It's a bracelet.

21
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:03,958
Isn't it? It's engraved too.

22
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,454
Check it out.

23
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:08,232
''To my best bud.''

24
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,330
Thanks, best bud.

25
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:16,892
Put it on!

26
00:01:16,892 --> 00:01:18,342
Now?

27
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:21,842
It should be saved

28
00:01:21,842 --> 00:01:23,338
for a special occasion.

29
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,964
That's the beauty part.

30
00:01:24,964 --> 00:01:26,545
It goes with everything.

31
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:28,367
You put this on,

32
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:29,447
you're good to go.

33
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,942
I've never been ''good to go,''

34
00:01:33,942 --> 00:01:36,393
so why not try some jewelry, huh?

35
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:40,491
Oh, man!

36
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:44,302
You are so wearing that bracelet.

37
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,471
I so am.

38
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:48,837
Any idea what this will

39
00:01:48,837 --> 00:01:50,367
do for your sex life?

40
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,959
It might slow down at first but once I'm used to the weight,

42
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,506
I'll be back on track.

43
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:44,391
This all looks good.

44
00:02:44,391 --> 00:02:45,386
Great.

45
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,558
If I want to call for a job reference?

46
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,832
That's right there.

47
00:02:50,832 --> 00:02:52,362
The manager, Chandler Bing.

48
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:53,497
All right.

49
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,286
Let's see if you're as good in person.

50
00:02:56,286 --> 00:02:58,265
Make me a salad.

51
00:02:58,378 --> 00:02:59,891
A salad? I could do

52
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:01,404
something more complicated.

53
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:04,416
No, just the salad will be fine.

54
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,309
You got it.

55
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,967
Now, I want you to tell me what

56
00:03:08,967 --> 00:03:11,515
you're doing while you're doing it.

57
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:13,890
All right.

58
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,522
Well, I'm tearing the lettuce.

59
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,359
Is it dirty?

60
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:18,456
Don't worry, I'll wash it.

61
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,427
Don't. I like it dirty.

62
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,431
It's your call.

63
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,463
So, what are you going to do next?

64
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,436
I thought I'd cut up the tomatoes.

65
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:34,275
Are they firm?

66
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,338
They're okay.

67
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,351
You sure they're not bad?

68
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,353
You sure they're not very, very bad?

69
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,452
No, they're okay.

70
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,256
You gonna slice them real nice?

71
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,297
I was gonna do them julienne.

72
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,359
I'm out of here.

73
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,303
Hello?

74
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:07,896
Rachel's not here.

75
00:04:07,896 --> 00:04:09,346
Can I take a message?

76
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,314
How do we spell Casey?

77
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,381
Is it like ''at the Bat''

78
00:04:13,381 --> 00:04:15,411
or ''and the Sunshine Band''?

79
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,224
Hey, who's this Casey?

80
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,455
A guy she met at a movie.

81
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,457
What does he want with her?

82
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,256
Probably ''do a little dance.''

83
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,533
You know, ''make a little love.''

84
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,243
Well, pretty much ''get down tonight.''

85
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,442
I don't know. I don't--

86
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:45,466
I don't get it. Two months ago,

87
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:47,383
Rachel and I were close.

88
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,353
Now I take messages from guys

89
00:04:49,353 --> 00:04:51,253
she meets at movies?

90
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:53,353
This Casey should be

91
00:04:53,353 --> 00:04:55,349
taking down my messages, you know?

92
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:59,948
Or Rachel and I should be together and we should get

94
00:04:59,948 --> 00:05:01,432
a message service.

95
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,293
Hang in there, it'll happen.

96
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,201
How do you know that?

97
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,204
Because she's your lobster.

98
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,437
She's going somewhere.

99
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,262
It's a known fact that lobsters

100
00:05:17,262 --> 00:05:19,310
fall in love and mate for life.

101
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,415
You know what? You can actually

102
00:05:21,415 --> 00:05:25,821
see old lobster couples walking around their tank

104
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:27,419
holding claws, like....

105
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,424
You have to picture lobsters.

106
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,429
You feeling better?

107
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,370
I think the fifth shower

108
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,270
got the interview off me.

109
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,534
Do you have other possibilities?

110
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:45,807
There is the possibility

111
00:05:45,807 --> 00:05:47,337
that I won't make rent.

112
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,438
I can lend you some money.

113
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,797
If I couldn't pay you back right away,

114
00:05:52,797 --> 00:05:55,345
I'd feel guilty and tense around you.

115
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,348
Why not borrow it from Mom and Dad?

116
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,325
You feel guilty and tense around them.

117
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:04,227
Might as well make money off of them.

118
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,398
The man's got a point.

119
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,192
What is that sparkly thing?

120
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,233
That thing?

121
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,199
Yeah, it's a little flashy.

122
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,243
No, no.

123
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,279
No, no. It's not flashy.

124
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,213
Not for a Goodfella.

125
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,817
That is sharp! That must've

126
00:06:27,817 --> 00:06:29,415
cost you a few doubloons.

127
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,272
It's fun. It's like knowing

128
00:06:33,272 --> 00:06:35,320
one of the Gabor sisters.

129
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,250
Hi.

130
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,234
Hi, darling.

131
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,324
What's this?

132
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,234
Some of your old stuff.

133
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,851
Well, sweetie,

134
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:48,364
we have a surprise for you.

135
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:52,241
We're turning your room into a gym.

136
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,537
Wow, that is a surprise!

137
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,327
Just one question.

138
00:06:56,327 --> 00:06:57,373
Why not Ross' room?

139
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:01,785
We talked about that but he had so many science

141
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:04,185
trophies, plaques, merit badges.

142
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,281
We didn't wanna disturb them.

143
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:07,417
God forbid.

144
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,328
What's new? What can you tell us?

145
00:07:10,328 --> 00:07:12,228
How's your job?

146
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:15,233
My job? Well....

147
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:17,301
Did I mention I still

148
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:19,201
don't have a boyfriend?

149
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,330
Oh well. I just assumed.

150
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:26,810
Oh, hi, Rachel!

151
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,209
Hi.

152
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,878
We're sorry to hear

153
00:07:29,878 --> 00:07:31,442
about your parents splitting up.

154
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,833
Well, they're just separated.

155
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,448
You never know. We'll see.

156
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,247
I can't say we were surprised.

157
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,839
They've been unhappy

158
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,352
since we've known them.

159
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,879
Especially after

160
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,329
the incident in Hawaii.

161
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,259
What? What incident?

162
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:51,899
No, no. I must be

163
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:53,429
thinking of someone else.

164
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,370
Maybe me.

165
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,466
Don't you have folding to do?

166
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,437
Fold, dear. You fold.

167
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,800
Want a refill?

168
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,284
I'm all right, thanks.

169
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:10,684
Give me a second.

170
00:08:10,684 --> 00:08:12,180
I want to get this right.

171
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,910
Eleven o'clock,

172
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,491
totally hot babe checking you out.

173
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,801
That was really good.

174
00:08:24,801 --> 00:08:27,201
I think I'm ready for my penis now.

175
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:36,364
I know what you're thinking.

176
00:08:36,364 --> 00:08:38,315
Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.

177
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:40,368
I'm Gail.

178
00:08:40,368 --> 00:08:41,318
Chandler.

179
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,790
I have to go.

180
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,257
It was nice meeting you.

181
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,817
Excellent. He could have

182
00:08:57,817 --> 00:09:00,200
gotten me a VCR or golf clubs.

183
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,366
But he got me the ''woman repeller.''

184
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,872
The eyesore from

185
00:09:04,872 --> 00:09:06,368
the Liberace House of Crap.

186
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:07,794
It's not bad.

187
00:09:07,794 --> 00:09:09,176
Easy for you to say.

188
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,330
You're not sporting a reject

189
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,378
from the Mr. T Collection.

190
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,801
''I pity the fool that puts on

191
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:17,382
my jewelry. I do.''

192
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:18,418
''I pity the fool that--''

193
00:09:18,418 --> 00:09:19,413
Hi.

194
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,907
Hey, man. We were just

195
00:09:22,907 --> 00:09:24,420
doing some impressions.

196
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:26,323
Do your Marcel Marceau.

197
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,226
That's actually good.

198
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,439
Would you look at that guy?

199
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:42,760
How long have they been talking?

200
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,307
A couple minutes.

201
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,214
Try doubling that.

202
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,416
It's like, ''Back off, buddy.

203
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:51,412
She's a waitress, not a geisha.''

204
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,222
I think she's okay.

205
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,279
Look at that. She pushes him away

206
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,230
and he won't budge.

207
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,266
I'm gonna do something.

208
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:05,283
We'll get a condo on the

209
00:10:05,283 --> 00:10:07,331
mountain. Ski in, ski out. Great.

210
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,332
Excuse me? Are you Rachel?

211
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:11,538
What?

212
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,343
Ross Geller.

213
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,862
God, in your ad you said

214
00:10:16,862 --> 00:10:18,477
you were pretty, but wow!

215
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,344
What are you doing?

216
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,356
Oh, my God, is this the wrong day?

217
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,825
I don't believe it. If it works out,

218
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:30,259
we'll have something to tell the kids.

219
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,387
You sure will.

220
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,397
I've gotta go.

221
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
Take care.

222
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:36,934
See you later.

223
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:38,367
Nice meeting you.

224
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,497
You're welcome.

225
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,875
What?

226
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,274
I was saving you.

227
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,910
Saving me from a pleasant

228
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,508
conversation with a man?

229
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,374
From where I was--

230
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,282
Ross, listen to me.

231
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,514
I am not yours to save.

232
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,481
But you are.

233
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:58,585
What?

234
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,260
You're my lobster.

235
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,798
Are you being

236
00:11:06,798 --> 00:11:08,265
the blind-date guy again?

237
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:12,337
No, you're my lobster.

238
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,229
Lobsters....

239
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:21,408
In the tank, when they're old...they get with the--

241
00:11:21,408 --> 00:11:23,438
They walk around holding the claws.

242
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,477
In the tank!

243
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,482
With the holding and....

244
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,773
Pheebs, wanna help

245
00:11:31,773 --> 00:11:33,257
with the lobster thing?

246
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,260
Do the claws again.

247
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,287
Forget the lobsters, okay?

248
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,360
Let's talk--

249
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,355
What about us?

250
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,460
Ross, there is no ''us.'' Okay?

251
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,317
No, but--

252
00:11:46,317 --> 00:11:47,363
No. Listen to me!

253
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,498
I fell for you and get clobbered.

254
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,772
You fall for me

255
00:11:51,772 --> 00:11:53,268
and I again get clobbered.

256
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,910
I'm tired of being clobbered,

257
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,508
you know?

258
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,477
It's just not worth it.

259
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,415
Well, but--

260
00:12:00,415 --> 00:12:02,246
No ''but,'' Ross.

261
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,885
We are never gonna happen, okay?

262
00:12:03,885 --> 00:12:05,449
Accept that.

263
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,417
''Except that'' what?

264
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,421
No. No.

265
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,427
Accept that.

266
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,236
Oh.

267
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,337
I gotta go.

268
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,873
Hey, man. Look, it's my best bud!

269
00:12:39,873 --> 00:12:42,256
How you doing?

270
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,860
You're getting good at that

271
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,458
Marcel Marceau thing.

272
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,280
What do you say we play some ball?

273
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,293
You and me?

274
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,467
Okay, that's my bad.

275
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,806
If you hated the bracelet,

276
00:12:58,806 --> 00:13:00,336
you should have just said so.

277
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,909
Doesn't the fact that I wore it say

278
00:13:02,909 --> 00:13:05,406
how much our friendship means to me?

279
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,214
But you insulted the bracelet

280
00:13:08,214 --> 00:13:10,210
and you made fun of me.

281
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,806
Well, that's the part

282
00:13:11,806 --> 00:13:13,256
where I'm a wank.

283
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,326
I hoped we wouldn't focus on that.

284
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:19,454
Oh, yeah? Well, focus on this.

285
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,269
Hard to argue with that.

286
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,956
Come on! I said I was

287
00:13:27,956 --> 00:13:29,440
sorry a hundred times.

288
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:34,334
I promise to never take it off my wrist.

290
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,867
If you want to stay in there

291
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:42,443
and be mad you just stay in there.

293
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,381
You know what the--

294
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:52,881
I am here, on my knees...holding up these couch cushions as a symbol

297
00:13:52,881 --> 00:13:54,365
of my sorrow and regret.

298
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,461
Much like they did in biblical times.

299
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,205
You may haveth anger now....

300
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:04,859
You're gonna grab yourself again,

301
00:14:04,859 --> 00:14:06,309
aren't you?

302
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,013
You know, that Steffi Graf

303
00:14:13,013 --> 00:14:14,509
has quite a tush.

304
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:17,317
I'm just saying!

305
00:14:17,317 --> 00:14:18,312
Right there.

306
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,338
Hey, guys.

307
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:21,418
Hi, darling.

308
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,252
You didn't bring my grandson?

309
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,878
He's at Carol's and Susan's today.

310
00:14:26,878 --> 00:14:29,426
A woman in my office is a lesbian.

311
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,428
I'm just saying.

312
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,906
Jack, look. There's that house

313
00:14:35,906 --> 00:14:38,340
paint commercial that cracks you up.

314
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,328
Where have you been?

315
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:45,374
Emotional hell.

316
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,418
Did they lend you the money?

317
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:49,352
I haven't asked them yet.

318
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,355
Come on, Monica, do it.

319
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,550
Hey, you guys.

320
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,359
Monica has some news.

321
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,896
Listen, I'm sorry I didn't

322
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:03,384
tell you this before but I'm no longer at my job.

324
00:15:03,384 --> 00:15:05,335
I had to leave it.

325
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,320
Why?

326
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,203
Because they made me.

327
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:12,277
You were fired?

328
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:14,245
What are you gonna do?

329
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:16,361
Judy, relax. This is our little

330
00:15:16,361 --> 00:15:18,409
''har-Monica'' we're talking about.

331
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,213
We taught her well.

332
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,332
10 percent of your paycheck goes...?

333
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:24,345
In the bank.

334
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,340
So she dips into her savings.

335
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,257
That's why it's there.

336
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,874
She's gonna be fine.

337
00:15:29,874 --> 00:15:31,421
Aren't you, sweetie?

338
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,260
In the bank.

339
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,345
If you need a little extra,

340
00:15:35,345 --> 00:15:37,358
you know where to find it.

341
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,269
Anything larger back there?

342
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,237
I can't believe it.

343
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,468
Would you stop already?

344
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,761
Get out of the bitter barn

345
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:48,245
and play in the hay.

346
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:49,410
You're right.

347
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,473
I should play in the hay.

348
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,298
I just dropped $400 to replace

349
00:15:53,298 --> 00:15:55,346
a bracelet I hated to begin with.

350
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,287
Bring on the hay.

351
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,251
Hey!

352
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,910
I've got something

353
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,394
that'll make you happy.

354
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,397
Guess what Gunther found?

355
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,392
Now you have two!

356
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,232
Oh, you have two.

357
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,434
What am I gonna do?

358
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:19,311
Hey.

359
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,302
Hey.

360
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,314
How come you have two?

361
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,247
This one's for you.

362
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,312
Get out!

363
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,219
No, I can't.

364
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,811
I know how much this means to you

365
00:16:36,811 --> 00:16:39,262
and it's about more than jewelry.

366
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,929
It's about you and me

367
00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:42,527
and that we're ''best buds.''

368
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:46,836
Is this friendship?

369
00:16:46,836 --> 00:16:48,235
I think so.

370
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:50,891
Check it out.

371
00:16:50,891 --> 00:16:52,341
We're bracelet buddies!

372
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,469
That's what they'll call us.

373
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,733
Here you go.

374
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:00,217
Pay me back whenever you like.

375
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:03,184
You have dinosaur checks?

376
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,835
You get your money

377
00:17:04,835 --> 00:17:06,382
and you learn something.

378
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,290
What's wrong with that?

379
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,418
Nothing.

380
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,390
Hey, you're a cheap-osaurus!

381
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,333
I'm kidding.

382
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,233
Thank you, I'm very grateful.

383
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,237
Hey, Mon, what is this?

384
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,742
My bathing suit from high school.

385
00:17:24,742 --> 00:17:27,210
I was a little bigger then.

386
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,461
That's what they use to cover

387
00:17:29,461 --> 00:17:31,509
Connecticut when it rains.

388
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,318
What's on this videotape?

389
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,320
I don't know. Put it in.

390
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,424
Over here, Jack. Okay.

391
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,230
Rachel's coming up the path.

392
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:53,384
Doesn't she look pretty?

393
00:17:53,384 --> 00:17:55,432
Jack? Can you get this?

394
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,340
Oh, my God.

395
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,372
What is with your nose?

396
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,217
They had to reduce it

397
00:18:06,217 --> 00:18:08,185
because of my deviated septum.

398
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,335
I was wrong. That's what they use

399
00:18:10,335 --> 00:18:12,383
to cover Connecticut.

400
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:16,319
This is us getting ready for prom.

401
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,811
We don't have to watch.

402
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:19,227
Yeah, we do.

403
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:19,877
Come on.

404
00:18:19,877 --> 00:18:20,423
It's fun!

405
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,326
Get a shot of Monica.

406
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,948
Where's Monica?

407
00:18:23,948 --> 00:18:25,495
-Over here, Dad.

408
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,399
Wait. How do you zoom out?

409
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,200
There she is.

410
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,439
Some girl ate Monica!

411
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,885
Shut up.

412
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:42,352
The camera adds ten pounds.

413
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,321
How many cameras are actually on you?

414
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,361
Oh, you look so great!

415
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,364
So do you! You look beautiful.

416
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:54,827
-Oops.

417
00:18:54,827 --> 00:18:55,321
-What?

418
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,334
I got mayonnaise on you.

419
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:58,852
It's just the shoulder,

420
00:18:58,852 --> 00:19:00,268
not my dress.

421
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,267
Everybody, smile.

422
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:05,872
Oh, Dad, turn it off!

423
00:19:05,872 --> 00:19:07,368
-It is off.

424
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:09,408
-It is not! What's with the red light?

425
00:19:09,408 --> 00:19:11,404
-It's the off light.

426
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,377
Right, Ross?

427
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,384
Looking good, Mr. Kotter.

428
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,297
-You look pretty tonight.

429
00:19:29,297 --> 00:19:30,394
-Oh, thanks.

430
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:36,323
-What are you doing this summer?

431
00:19:36,323 --> 00:19:39,241
-I'm gonna hang out, work on my music.

432
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,365
Is my hook unhooked?

433
00:19:44,365 --> 00:19:46,316
These things keep falling down.

434
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,216
Let me see. I don't know.

435
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,521
What are you gonna do...

436
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,456
The guys are here!

437
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:00,322
...this summer?

438
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,366
Work on your music?

439
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,373
Oh, my God, Roy Gublik!

440
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,254
You know,

441
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:14,233
Roy saw Star Wars 31 7 times.

442
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,337
He made the paper.

443
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,816
Where's Chip?

444
00:20:18,816 --> 00:20:20,283
Why isn't he here yet?

445
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,835
He'll be here, okay?

446
00:20:21,835 --> 00:20:23,285
Take a chill pill.

447
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:25,480
There.

448
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,861
I just told Rachel

449
00:20:32,861 --> 00:20:34,459
that Roy touched my boob.

450
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,885
I can't go to my prom without a date.

451
00:20:39,885 --> 00:20:42,268
I can't. It's too late.

452
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,841
If you're not going,

453
00:20:43,841 --> 00:20:45,308
I don't want to go.

454
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,277
Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass!

455
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,506
I have a wonderful idea.

456
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,479
You should take Rachel to the prom.

457
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:56,511
Doubtful.

458
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,773
Jack, give me that.

459
00:20:58,773 --> 00:21:00,257
Talk to your son.

460
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,389
All right, go on.

461
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:03,418
This is heavy.

462
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,793
Your mother's right.

463
00:21:05,793 --> 00:21:07,357
Take her. You can wear my tux.

464
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,332
She won't go with me.

465
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:10,852
Of course she would.

466
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,336
You're a college man.

467
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:13,466
-I don't know.

468
00:21:13,466 --> 00:21:14,461
-Well, come on.

469
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,468
Don't you wanna find out?

470
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,340
I can't believe

471
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,437
I can't go to the prom.

472
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,344
This is so harsh!

473
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:28,765
-Okay. Hold my board.

474
00:21:28,765 --> 00:21:30,278
-Attaboy. Attaboy.

475
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,873
I think we've seen enough.

476
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,357
Let's turn it off.

477
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,359
Well, I'm not gonna watch.

478
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:39,262
Come on, kid. Let's go.

479
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:42,964
-My! Are you handsome!

480
00:21:42,964 --> 00:21:44,562
-Let's show them.

481
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,498
Just a sec, Dad.

482
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:50,373
Okay, be cool. Just be cool.

483
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,219
Okay, Dad.

484
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:03,249
Rachel, ready or not,

485
00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:05,245
here comes your knight in shining--

486
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,416
Oh, no!

487
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,419
Bye! Don't wait up.

488
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,319
Chip!

489
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,331
Oh, dear.

490
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,266
How do I turn this off?

491
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:17,915
-Press the button.

492
00:22:17,915 --> 00:22:19,462
-Which one? Which button? Jack!

493
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,263
The button. The button!

494
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,469
I can't believe you did that.

495
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,341
Yeah, well....

496
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,339
See? He's her lobster.

497
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,418
Dance with him.

498
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,323
Mom, I'm hungry!

499
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,360
Dance with your father.

500
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:21,928
I may not know any flashdances but I'm no slouch

502
00:23:21,928 --> 00:23:23,424
on the dance floor.

503
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,305
-Oh, Jack.

504
00:23:31,305 --> 00:23:32,368
-Oh, Judy!
