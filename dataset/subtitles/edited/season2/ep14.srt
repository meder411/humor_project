1
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:09,538
Hold on a second.

2
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,337
Nice. Nice.

3
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:16,847
Something for you.

4
00:00:16,847 --> 00:00:18,246
What's this?

5
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,251
81 2 bucks.

6
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:25,484
Didn't Big Leon tell you? It's a thousand if you want me for the night.

7
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:27,806
What is this for?

8
00:00:27,806 --> 00:00:29,353
Well, I'm making money now.

9
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:35,392
I'm paying you back for headshots, electric bills, pizza-- Love you, man.

10
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:39,495
Well, thanks, man. Now I can get my pony.

11
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:44,470
This is a little extra something for always being there for me.

12
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,573
Wow! I don't know what to say.

13
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:56,478
Wow! I don't know what to say.

14
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,405
What do you say?

15
00:00:58,405 --> 00:00:59,520
I don't know.

16
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,353
It's a bracelet.

17
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:05,454
Isn't it? It's engraved too. Check it out.

18
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:08,232
''To my best bud.''

19
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,330
Thanks, best bud.

20
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:16,892
Put it on!

21
00:01:16,892 --> 00:01:18,342
Now?

22
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:23,338
It should be saved for a special occasion.

23
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:26,546
That's the beauty part. It goes with everything.

24
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,448
You put this on, you're good to go.

25
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:36,394
I've never been ''good to go,'' so why not try some jewelry, huh?

26
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:40,491
Oh, man!

27
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:44,302
You are so wearing that bracelet.

28
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,471
I so am.

29
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,367
Any idea what this will do for your sex life?

30
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:55,506
It might slow down at first but once I'm used to the weight, I'll be back on track.

32
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:44,391
This all looks good.

33
00:02:44,391 --> 00:02:45,386
Great.

34
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,558
If I want to call for a job reference?

35
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:52,362
That's right there. The manager, Chandler Bing.

36
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:53,497
All right.

37
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:58,266
Let's see if you're as good in person. Make me a salad.

38
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,404
A salad? I could do something more complicated.

39
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:04,416
No, just the salad will be fine.

40
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,309
You got it.

41
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:11,516
Now, I want you to tell me what you're doing while you're doing it.

42
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:15,523
All right. Well, I'm tearing the lettuce.

43
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:17,359
Is it dirty?

44
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:18,456
Don't worry, I'll wash it.

45
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,427
Don't. I like it dirty.

46
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,431
It's your call.

47
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,463
So, what are you going to do next?

48
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,436
I thought I'd cut up the tomatoes.

49
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:34,275
Are they firm?

50
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,338
They're okay.

51
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,351
You sure they're not bad?

52
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,353
You sure they're not very, very bad?

53
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,452
No, they're okay.

54
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,256
You gonna slice them real nice?

55
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,297
I was gonna do them julienne.

56
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,359
I'm out of here.

57
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,303
Hello?

58
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,347
Rachel's not here. Can I take a message?

59
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,314
How do we spell Casey?

60
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:15,412
Is it like ''at the Bat'' or ''and the Sunshine Band''?

61
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,224
Hey, who's this Casey?

62
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,455
A guy she met at a movie.

63
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,457
What does he want with her?

64
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,256
Probably ''do a little dance.''

65
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,533
You know, ''make a little love.''

66
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,243
Well, pretty much ''get down tonight.''

67
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,442
I don't know. I don't--

68
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:47,383
I don't get it. Two months ago, Rachel and I were close.

69
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:51,253
Now I take messages from guys she meets at movies?

70
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:55,350
This Casey should be taking down my messages, you know?

71
00:04:55,495 --> 00:05:01,433
Or Rachel and I should be together and we should get a message service.

73
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,293
Hang in there, it'll happen.

74
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,201
How do you know that?

75
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,204
Because she's your lobster.

76
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,437
She's going somewhere.

77
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:19,310
It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life.

78
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:27,420
You know what? You can actually see old lobster couples walking around their tank holding claws, like....

80
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,424
You have to picture lobsters.

81
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,429
You feeling better?

82
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,270
I think the fifth shower got the interview off me.

83
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,534
Do you have other possibilities?

84
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,337
There is the possibility that I won't make rent.

85
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,438
I can lend you some money.

86
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:55,346
If I couldn't pay you back right away, I'd feel guilty and tense around you.

87
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,348
Why not borrow it from Mom and Dad?

88
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,325
You feel guilty and tense around them.

89
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:04,227
Might as well make money off of them.

90
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,398
The man's got a point.

91
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,192
What is that sparkly thing?

92
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,233
That thing?

93
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,199
Yeah, it's a little flashy.

94
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,243
No, no.

95
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:23,213
No, no. It's not flashy. Not for a Goodfella.

96
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,416
That is sharp! That must've cost you a few doubloons.

97
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:35,320
It's fun. It's like knowing one of the Gabor sisters.

98
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,250
Hi.

99
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,234
Hi, darling.

100
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,324
What's this?

101
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,234
Some of your old stuff.

102
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,364
Well, sweetie, we have a surprise for you.

103
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:52,241
We're turning your room into a gym.

104
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,537
Wow, that is a surprise!

105
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,374
Just one question. Why not Ross' room?

106
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:04,186
We talked about that but he had so many science trophies, plaques, merit badges.

108
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,281
We didn't wanna disturb them.

109
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:07,417
God forbid.

110
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,228
What's new? What can you tell us? How's your job?

111
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:15,233
My job? Well....

112
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:19,201
Did I mention I still don't have a boyfriend?

113
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,330
Oh well. I just assumed.

114
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:26,810
Oh, hi, Rachel!

115
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,209
Hi.

116
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:31,442
We're sorry to hear about your parents splitting up.

117
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:35,449
Well, they're just separated. You never know. We'll see.

118
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,247
I can't say we were surprised.

119
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,352
They've been unhappy since we've known them.

120
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,330
Especially after the incident in Hawaii.

121
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,259
What? What incident?

122
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,429
No, no. I must be thinking of someone else.

123
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,370
Maybe me.

124
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,466
Don't you have folding to do?

125
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,437
Fold, dear. You fold.

126
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,800
Want a refill?

127
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,284
I'm all right, thanks.

128
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:12,180
Give me a second. I want to get this right.

129
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,492
Eleven o'clock, totally hot babe checking you out.

130
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:27,202
That was really good. I think I'm ready for my penis now.

131
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:38,315
I know what you're thinking. Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.

132
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:40,368
I'm Gail.

133
00:08:40,368 --> 00:08:41,318
Chandler.

134
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,258
I have to go. It was nice meeting you.

135
00:08:55,434 --> 00:09:00,201
Excellent. He could have gotten me a VCR or golf clubs.

136
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,366
But he got me the ''woman repeller.''

137
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,368
The eyesore from the Liberace House of Crap.

138
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:07,794
It's not bad.

139
00:09:07,794 --> 00:09:09,176
Easy for you to say.

140
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:13,378
You're not sporting a reject from the Mr. T Collection.

141
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,383
''I pity the fool that puts on my jewelry. I do.''

142
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,414
''I pity the fool that--'' Hi.

143
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,420
Hey, man. We were just doing some impressions.

144
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:26,323
Do your Marcel Marceau.

145
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,226
That's actually good.

146
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,439
Would you look at that guy?

147
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:42,760
How long have they been talking?

148
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,307
A couple minutes.

149
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,214
Try doubling that.

150
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,413
It's like, ''Back off, buddy. She's a waitress, not a geisha.''

151
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,222
I think she's okay.

152
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:59,230
Look at that. She pushes him away and he won't budge.

153
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,266
I'm gonna do something.

154
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:07,331
We'll get a condo on the mountain. Ski in, ski out. Great.

155
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,332
Excuse me? Are you Rachel?

156
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:11,538
What?

157
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,343
Ross Geller.

158
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,478
God, in your ad you said you were pretty, but wow!

159
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,344
What are you doing?

160
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,356
Oh, my God, is this the wrong day?

161
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:30,260
I don't believe it. If it works out, we'll have something to tell the kids.

162
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,387
You sure will.

163
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,397
I've gotta go.

164
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
Take care.

165
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,368
See you later. Nice meeting you.

166
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,497
You're welcome.

167
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,875
What?

168
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,274
I was saving you.

169
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,509
Saving me from a pleasant conversation with a man?

170
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,374
From where I was--

171
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,282
Ross, listen to me.

172
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,514
I am not yours to save.

173
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,481
But you are.

174
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:58,585
What?

175
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,260
You're my lobster.

176
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,266
Are you being the blind-date guy again?

177
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:12,337
No, you're my lobster.

178
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,229
Lobsters....

179
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:23,439
In the tank, when they're old...they get with the-- They walk around holding the claws.

181
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,477
In the tank!

182
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,482
With the holding and....

183
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:33,258
Pheebs, wanna help with the lobster thing?

184
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,260
Do the claws again.

185
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,287
Forget the lobsters, okay?

186
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,356
Let's talk-- What about us?

187
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,460
Ross, there is no ''us.'' Okay?

188
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,317
No, but--

189
00:11:46,317 --> 00:11:47,363
No. Listen to me!

190
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,498
I fell for you and get clobbered.

191
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:53,268
You fall for me and I again get clobbered.

192
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:56,509
I'm tired of being clobbered, you know?

193
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,477
It's just not worth it.

194
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,415
Well, but--

195
00:12:00,415 --> 00:12:02,246
No ''but,'' Ross.

196
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:05,449
We are never gonna happen, okay? Accept that.

197
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,417
''Except that'' what?

198
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,421
No. No.

199
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,427
Accept that.

200
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,236
Oh.

201
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,337
I gotta go.

202
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:42,257
Hey, man. Look, it's my best bud! How you doing?

203
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,459
You're getting good at that Marcel Marceau thing.

204
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:52,294
What do you say we play some ball? You and me?

205
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,467
Okay, that's my bad.

206
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,336
If you hated the bracelet, you should have just said so.

207
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:05,406
Doesn't the fact that I wore it say how much our friendship means to me?

208
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:10,211
But you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me.

209
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:13,257
Well, that's the part where I'm a wank.

210
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,326
I hoped we wouldn't focus on that.

211
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:19,454
Oh, yeah? Well, focus on this.

212
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,269
Hard to argue with that.

213
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,441
Come on! I said I was sorry a hundred times.

214
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:34,334
I promise to never take it off my wrist.

216
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:42,443
If you want to stay in there and be mad you just stay in there.

218
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,381
You know what the--

219
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:54,366
I am here, on my knees...holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret.

222
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,461
Much like they did in biblical times.

223
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,205
You may haveth anger now....

224
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:06,310
You're gonna grab yourself again, aren't you?

225
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,509
You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush.

226
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,313
I'm just saying! Right there.

227
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,338
Hey, guys.

228
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:21,418
Hi, darling.

229
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,252
You didn't bring my grandson?

230
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,878
He's at Carol's and Susan's today.

231
00:14:26,878 --> 00:14:29,426
A woman in my office is a lesbian.

232
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,428
I'm just saying.

233
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:38,341
Jack, look. There's that house paint commercial that cracks you up.

234
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:44,328
Where have you been?

235
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:45,374
Emotional hell.

236
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:47,418
Did they lend you the money?

237
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:49,352
I haven't asked them yet.

238
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,355
Come on, Monica, do it.

239
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,550
Hey, you guys.

240
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,359
Monica has some news.

241
00:14:56,462 --> 00:15:05,335
Listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but I'm no longer at my job. I had to leave it.

243
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,320
Why?

244
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,203
Because they made me.

245
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:14,245
You were fired? What are you gonna do?

246
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:18,409
Judy, relax. This is our little ''har-Monica'' we're talking about.

247
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,213
We taught her well.

248
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,332
10 percent of your paycheck goes...?

249
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:24,345
In the bank.

250
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:28,257
So she dips into her savings. That's why it's there.

251
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:31,421
She's gonna be fine. Aren't you, sweetie?

252
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,260
In the bank.

253
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:37,359
If you need a little extra, you know where to find it.

254
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,269
Anything larger back there?

255
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,237
I can't believe it.

256
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,468
Would you stop already?

257
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,246
Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.

258
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,474
You're right. I should play in the hay.

259
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,346
I just dropped $400 to replace a bracelet I hated to begin with.

260
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,287
Bring on the hay.

261
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,251
Hey!

262
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:03,395
I've got something that'll make you happy.

263
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,397
Guess what Gunther found?

264
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,392
Now you have two!

265
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,232
Oh, you have two.

266
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,434
What am I gonna do?

267
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:19,311
Hey.

268
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,302
Hey.

269
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,314
How come you have two?

270
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,247
This one's for you.

271
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,312
Get out!

272
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,219
No, I can't.

273
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,263
I know how much this means to you and it's about more than jewelry.

274
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,528
It's about you and me and that we're ''best buds.''

275
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:48,235
Is this friendship? I think so.

276
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:52,342
Check it out. We're bracelet buddies!

277
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,469
That's what they'll call us.

278
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:00,218
Here you go. Pay me back whenever you like.

279
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:03,184
You have dinosaur checks?

280
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,382
You get your money and you learn something.

281
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,290
What's wrong with that?

282
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,418
Nothing.

283
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,390
Hey, you're a cheap-osaurus!

284
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:18,233
I'm kidding. Thank you, I'm very grateful.

285
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,237
Hey, Mon, what is this?

286
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:27,211
My bathing suit from high school. I was a little bigger then.

287
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:31,509
That's what they use to cover Connecticut when it rains.

288
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,318
What's on this videotape?

289
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,320
I don't know. Put it in.

290
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,424
Over here, Jack. Okay.

291
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,230
Rachel's coming up the path.

292
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:55,432
Doesn't she look pretty? Jack? Can you get this?

293
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,340
Oh, my God.

294
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,372
What is with your nose?

295
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:08,185
They had to reduce it because of my deviated septum.

296
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:12,383
I was wrong. That's what they use to cover Connecticut.

297
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:16,319
This is us getting ready for prom.

298
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:17,811
We don't have to watch.

299
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:19,227
Yeah, we do.

300
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:19,877
Come on.

301
00:18:19,877 --> 00:18:20,423
It's fun!

302
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,326
Get a shot of Monica.

303
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,495
-Where's Monica?
-Over here, Dad.

304
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,399
Wait. How do you zoom out?

305
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,200
There she is.

306
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,439
Some girl ate Monica!

307
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,353
Shut up. The camera adds ten pounds.

308
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,321
How many cameras are actually on you?

309
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,361
Oh, you look so great!

310
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,364
So do you! You look beautiful.

311
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,322
-Oops.
-What?

312
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,334
I got mayonnaise on you.

313
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,269
It's just the shoulder, not my dress.

314
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,267
Everybody, smile.

315
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,368
-Oh, Dad, turn it off!
-It is off.

316
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:11,405
-It is not! What's with the red light?
-It's the off light.

317
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,377
Right, Ross?

318
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,384
Looking good, Mr. Kotter.

319
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,395
-You look pretty tonight.
-Oh, thanks.

320
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:39,241
-What are you doing this summer?
-I'm gonna hang out, work on my music.

321
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:46,316
Is my hook unhooked? These things keep falling down.

322
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,216
Let me see. I don't know.

323
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,521
What are you gonna do...

324
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,456
The guys are here!

325
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:00,322
...this summer?

326
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,366
Work on your music?

327
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,373
Oh, my God, Roy Gublik!

328
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:14,234
You know, Roy saw Star Wars 31 7 times.

329
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,337
He made the paper.

330
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:20,284
Where's Chip? Why isn't he here yet?

331
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,286
He'll be here, okay? Take a chill pill.

332
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:25,480
There.

333
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,460
I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.

334
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:42,269
I can't go to my prom without a date. I can't. It's too late.

335
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:45,309
If you're not going, I don't want to go.

336
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,277
Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass!

337
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,506
I have a wonderful idea.

338
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,479
You should take Rachel to the prom.

339
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:56,511
Doubtful.

340
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,258
Jack, give me that. Talk to your son.

341
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,419
All right, go on. This is heavy.

342
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:07,357
Your mother's right. Take her. You can wear my tux.

343
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,332
She won't go with me.

344
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:12,337
Of course she would. You're a college man.

345
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,462
-I don't know.
-Well, come on.

346
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,468
Don't you wanna find out?

347
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,438
I can't believe I can't go to the prom.

348
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,344
This is so harsh!

349
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:30,278
-Okay. Hold my board.
-Attaboy. Attaboy.

350
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:33,358
I think we've seen enough. Let's turn it off.

351
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,359
Well, I'm not gonna watch.

352
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:39,262
Come on, kid. Let's go.

353
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:44,563
-My! Are you handsome!
-Let's show them.

354
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,498
Just a sec, Dad.

355
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:50,373
Okay, be cool. Just be cool.

356
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,219
Okay, Dad.

357
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:05,246
Rachel, ready or not, here comes your knight in shining--

358
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,416
Oh, no!

359
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,419
Bye! Don't wait up.

360
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,319
Chip!

361
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:14,331
Oh, dear.

362
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,266
How do I turn this off?

363
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:19,462
-Press the button.
-Which one? Which button? Jack!

364
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,263
The button. The button!

365
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,469
I can't believe you did that.

366
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,341
Yeah, well....

367
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,339
