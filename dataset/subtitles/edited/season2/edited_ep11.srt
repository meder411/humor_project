1
00:00:01,476 --> 00:00:07,415
Okay, here's his diaper bag and his Mr. Winky.

2
00:00:08,316 --> 00:00:12,385
And him. Hi!

4
00:00:13,288 --> 00:00:14,300
How did everything go?

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,312
Great!

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:20,418
There was a projectile throwing up incident, but he started it.

7
00:00:21,496 --> 00:00:23,430
We've gotta go.

8
00:00:24,499 --> 00:00:26,399
Oh, right.

9
00:00:26,435 --> 00:00:28,528
I've got some news. It's about us.

10
00:00:29,304 --> 00:00:30,800
You and me?

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,296
No. Susan and me.

12
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,307
The other ''us.''

13
00:00:38,447 --> 00:00:40,506
We're getting married.

14
00:00:45,554 --> 00:00:49,422
As in, ''I now pronounce you wife and wife'' married?

15
00:00:50,325 --> 00:00:53,556
We'd like you to come. We understand if you don't want to.

16
00:00:54,362 --> 00:00:58,355
Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.

17
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,458
I just thought that--

18
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:08,466
Why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy?

20
00:01:08,577 --> 00:01:11,375
And I'm reveling, baby! Believe me!

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,374
Is your finger caught in that chair?

22
00:01:16,485 --> 00:01:18,476
Want us to go?

23
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,500
This is cool. You're actually on television.

24
00:02:11,273 --> 00:02:17,303
I know. It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of Our Lives.

25
00:02:17,412 --> 00:02:23,282
Then I started thinking about us, and how these are the days of our lives.

26
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,469
Yes!

27
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:26,419
What?

28
00:02:26,488 --> 00:02:32,486
Carol and Susan's caterer had a bike accident and she's in a full-body cast.

30
00:02:33,428 --> 00:02:35,396
Yes!

31
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:41,494
They asked me, which is cool since I've never catered and I need money. Is this a problem?

33
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,868
Would it matter?

34
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:45,432
You're so great! Thank you!

35
00:02:45,507 --> 00:02:46,957
You're really not going?

36
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:48,407
I'm really not.

37
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:52,402
They already live together. Why do they need to get married?

38
00:02:52,514 --> 00:02:54,311
They love each other.

39
00:02:54,416 --> 00:02:58,409
They wanna celebrate that love with the people close to them.

40
00:02:58,453 --> 00:03:01,354
If you wanna call that a reason.

41
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:05,357
Who's the bitterest man In the living room?

42
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,358
The bitterest man In the living room?

43
00:03:09,497 --> 00:03:11,465
Hi, neighbor.

44
00:03:13,368 --> 00:03:15,364
I thought you were over this.

45
00:03:15,364 --> 00:03:17,360
That has nothing to do with it.

46
00:03:17,472 --> 00:03:21,374
If she were marrying a guy, you wouldn't expect me to go.

47
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:26,278
If she were marrying a guy, she'd be the worst lesbian ever.

48
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:29,475
Did I miss it?

49
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:33,385
No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.

50
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:36,280
She's pretty.

51
00:03:36,324 --> 00:03:43,496
And she's nice. She taught me about how to work with the cameras and smell-the-fart acting.

53
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:46,966
I'm sorry, what?

54
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:48,399
Excuse me?

55
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:51,303
Smell-the-fart acting.

56
00:03:51,506 --> 00:03:58,345
You got so many lines to learn that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next.

58
00:03:58,413 --> 00:04:03,442
So while you're thinking you take this big pause where you look all intense.

60
00:04:04,252 --> 00:04:05,446
Like this....

61
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,387
Here's my scene! Here's my scene!

62
00:04:16,498 --> 00:04:18,363
Mrs. Wallace?

63
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,301
Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.

64
00:04:21,369 --> 00:04:23,394
Is she going to be all right?

65
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:27,407
I'm afraid the situation is much more dire than we'd expected.

66
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:38,275
Your sister's suffering from a...subcranial hematoma.

68
00:04:39,521 --> 00:04:43,480
Perhaps we can discuss this further over coffee.

69
00:04:49,597 --> 00:04:51,394
Nice!

70
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,493
For a minute, I thought you were actually smelling something.

71
00:04:58,606 --> 00:05:00,335
-Again!
-All right!

72
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,404
That was so good!

73
00:05:01,404 --> 00:05:02,433
Do it again.

74
00:05:03,445 --> 00:05:07,245
Damn it, Braverman! It's right there on the chart!

75
00:05:08,283 --> 00:05:12,276
I gotta get to work. I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.

76
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,918
No, no, that's me.

77
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:15,482
Oh, right.

78
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:22,262
Oh, thanks. Couldn't....

79
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:25,345
Is everything okay?

80
00:05:25,345 --> 00:05:26,391
No.

81
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:32,498
One of my clients died on the massage table today.

82
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:34,468
Oh, my God!

83
00:05:35,276 --> 00:05:38,268
That's a little more relaxed than you want them.

84
00:05:40,482 --> 00:05:46,511
She was, you know, 82 years old and her name was Mrs. Adelman.

86
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:48,886
Oh, honey.

87
00:05:48,886 --> 00:05:50,484
It's just so strange.

88
00:05:50,525 --> 00:05:57,431
She probably woke up today and thought I'll have breakfast, take a walk, then have my massage.

90
00:05:57,499 --> 00:06:02,232
Little did she know God was thinking, ''Okay, but that's it.''

91
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:10,468
Oh, but the weirdest thing was I was cleansing her aura when it happened.

93
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:17,240
And when her spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.

94
00:06:17,352 --> 00:06:19,400
What do you mean?

95
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,448
I think it went into me.

96
00:06:30,365 --> 00:06:33,493
This is so hard. I can't decide between Iamb or duck.

97
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,463
Lambs are scarier.

98
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:39,468
Or the movie would have been called Silence of the Ducks.

99
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:42,470
Okay, who ordered what?

100
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:47,413
I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.

101
00:06:47,482 --> 00:06:51,282
This with the cigarette butt in it, that's decaf?

102
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,513
Oh, God.

103
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:55,313
You're so uptight about your mom coming.

104
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:01,319
I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, my life is crap.

106
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:09,335
Talk about crap, listen to Stella Neidman tell her story about Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.

108
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:18,344
I'm sorry. At least you guys don't have to hear what she says in my head.

109
00:07:20,381 --> 00:07:25,250
Pheebs? How long do you think this lady will be with us?

110
00:07:25,353 --> 00:07:28,447
I don't know. She obviously has unfinished business.

111
00:07:29,257 --> 00:07:30,383
Sit up!

112
00:07:33,294 --> 00:07:34,386
There she is!

113
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,929
Mom!

114
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:37,362
Hey, sweetie!

115
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:45,371
So this is where you work!

116
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:47,464
Oh, it's wonderful!

117
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:52,372
Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell?

118
00:07:52,413 --> 00:07:54,313
I guess that's the fun.

119
00:07:54,415 --> 00:07:56,406
Pretty much. Meet my friends.

120
00:07:56,484 --> 00:07:59,476
Monica! You look gorgeous!

121
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:04,220
Oh, my! The last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.

122
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:09,219
This is Joey, this is Phoebe, and this is Chandler.

123
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,393
You remember Ross?

124
00:08:10,393 --> 00:08:11,456
Oh, hello, Ross.

125
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:13,359
Mrs. Gree--

126
00:08:15,436 --> 00:08:20,237
What do you think of my daughter, in the apron with the big job?

127
00:08:20,341 --> 00:08:22,366
Oh, Mom!

128
00:08:23,244 --> 00:08:27,442
If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.

129
00:08:28,283 --> 00:08:31,446
Believe me, sometimes that happens.

130
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:36,355
This is just so exciting! You know, I never worked.

131
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:43,389
I went from my father's house to a sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you!

133
00:08:43,498 --> 00:08:45,398
Really?

134
00:08:45,398 --> 00:08:47,298
Yes. Let's make a day of it.

135
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:52,271
We'll have lunch, shop, get our nails done. Whatever you want.

136
00:08:52,307 --> 00:08:54,468
I have to work.

137
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:58,275
What, no one else can pour coffee?

138
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:01,439
I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Durmer.

139
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:07,347
That's before the lousy face-lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.

140
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:13,223
Pheebs, who's Evelyn Durmer?

141
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:17,355
I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?

142
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:20,459
Oh, my God!

143
00:09:21,235 --> 00:09:25,228
There's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.

144
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:30,273
Just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.

145
00:09:33,247 --> 00:09:35,272
You have some life here, sweetie!

146
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:42,450
I realize you were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get a house in the suburbs with all the security.

148
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:44,554
This is so much better for me.

149
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:49,286
I know. You didn't love Barry, honey.

150
00:09:49,364 --> 00:09:51,491
And I've never seen you this happy.

151
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,396
I look at you and I think, ''This is what I want.''

152
00:09:57,505 --> 00:09:59,370
For me.

153
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:02,326
Well, not just for you.

154
00:10:02,326 --> 00:10:04,277
What do you mean?

155
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,373
I'm considering leaving your father.

156
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,481
All right, tell me if this is too cute.

157
00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:18,423
Lesbian wedding... chicken breasts.

158
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:24,521
Oh, God. I think I'm gonna be sick.

159
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,598
What? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.

160
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:36,307
Oh, honey, I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me.

161
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,538
What can I do?

162
00:10:38,312 --> 00:10:42,408
You want me to make those marshmallow treats you used to like?

163
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:46,419
I can call up Carmela and find out how.

164
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,513
I don't understand. I thought you were happy.

165
00:10:49,557 --> 00:10:52,424
Yeah, well, so did I.

166
00:10:52,527 --> 00:11:01,358
Know how sometimes you're driving on the highway and you get home and you can't remember having driven there?

168
00:11:01,402 --> 00:11:04,269
That's what my life's been like.

169
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:07,502
Well, couldn't you listen to the radio more?

170
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:14,414
I wish it were that easy. Then I see you and I think, ''Why can't I have this?''

172
00:11:14,515 --> 00:11:19,384
I want adventures, I want to hang out, I want a Chandler.

173
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:27,385
Mom, believe me, Chandler is no reason to leave Daddy.

174
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:32,296
You think I'm having fun, but it's really hard. Really hard.

175
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,497
I've got a lousy job, I barely make rent, and forget about buying stuff!

176
00:11:37,538 --> 00:11:40,530
Oh, honey, you don't understand.

177
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:45,336
I'd be doing what you're doing, but with money.

178
00:11:46,347 --> 00:11:49,316
It's very different.

179
00:11:53,354 --> 00:11:54,434
You had no idea?

180
00:11:54,434 --> 00:11:55,514
None.

181
00:11:55,556 --> 00:11:57,421
They didn't fight a lot?

182
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:00,359
No, they didn't even talk to each other.

183
00:12:00,394 --> 00:12:04,353
How was I supposed to know they were having problems?

184
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:09,300
You know, in my day, divorce was not an option.

185
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,463
Hey, look who's up!

186
00:12:13,474 --> 00:12:16,307
I just can't believe this is happening!

187
00:12:16,377 --> 00:12:19,312
When I was little, all parents got divorced.

188
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:22,406
I figured as an adult, I wouldn't have to worry.

189
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:27,511
Can't you look at this as flattering? She wants to be more like you.

190
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:32,385
Well, then, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?

191
00:12:32,426 --> 00:12:38,488
When my parents divorced, I went to a shrink and she told me that kids blame themselves.

193
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:41,534
But in your case, it's actually kind of true.

194
00:12:42,436 --> 00:12:43,528
Oh, that's him.

195
00:12:44,505 --> 00:12:48,441
Damn! My mail-order grandfather hasn't come yet.

196
00:12:49,343 --> 00:12:49,923
Phoebe?

197
00:12:49,923 --> 00:12:50,503
Hi, Mr. Adelman.

198
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,307
Nice to see you.

199
00:12:52,307 --> 00:12:53,302
Thanks for coming.

200
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:58,408
That's okay. Although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.

201
00:12:59,353 --> 00:13:00,445
Do you wanna sit?

202
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:05,289
No, I spent most of midmorning trying to stand up.

203
00:13:06,294 --> 00:13:08,285
What can I do for you, dear?

204
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:18,372
Okay, I don't know how to say this but I think when your wife's spirit left her body it kind of stuck around in me.

207
00:13:19,273 --> 00:13:21,366
You're saying my wife is in you?

208
00:13:22,276 --> 00:13:28,278
Yeah. You don't have to believe me but can you think of any unfinished business she had?

210
00:13:28,382 --> 00:13:30,373
Any reason to hang around?

211
00:13:30,418 --> 00:13:38,481
I don't know what to say. All I can think of is that she said that before she died, she wanted to see everything.

213
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:40,456
Everything?

214
00:13:40,456 --> 00:13:41,485
Everything.

215
00:13:41,596 --> 00:13:43,063
That's a lot of stuff.

216
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:44,530
Oh, wait, I....

217
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:50,327
I remember she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.

218
00:13:58,346 --> 00:14:02,282
I'm sorry. There's laughing in my head.

219
00:14:03,484 --> 00:14:06,351
Worth a shot, huh?

220
00:14:11,292 --> 00:14:13,453
Look at this!

221
00:14:14,362 --> 00:14:16,313
These are Halloween, three years ago.

222
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,264
My little martini.

223
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:21,359
I love your olive head.

224
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:25,496
Oh, and look, here's Barry. Did he come straight from work?

225
00:14:26,274 --> 00:14:28,401
Oh, no. That was his costume.

226
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:35,375
See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.

227
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,510
Yeah, he thought that was really funny.

228
00:14:39,287 --> 00:14:43,314
You guys? Remember when I said before I don't need your help?

229
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:48,419
Actually, you said, ''Don't touch that and get the hell out of my kitchen.''

230
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:51,522
Really? Weird. Anyway....

231
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,494
I planned well. I planned and planned.

232
00:14:55,336 --> 00:14:57,531
I just didn't plan enough time to do it.

233
00:14:58,406 --> 00:14:59,822
You want some help?

234
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:01,238
If you want.

235
00:15:05,546 --> 00:15:09,243
What a day! I took her everywhere.

236
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:16,451
The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.

237
00:15:17,258 --> 00:15:18,350
She's still with you?

238
00:15:18,392 --> 00:15:23,261
Yes. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet.

239
00:15:23,364 --> 00:15:27,266
Be right back. She has to go to the bathroom again.

240
00:15:28,402 --> 00:15:31,462
Such a pretty face!

241
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,503
Oh, this is so much fun! Just the girls!

242
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,509
You know what we should do? Does anybody have marijuana?

243
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:43,510
God!

244
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,413
Did my mother just ask if we have pot?

245
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,515
Look, no one's smoking pot around all this food.

246
00:15:52,293 --> 00:15:54,284
Well, that's fine.

247
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:58,287
I never did it. I just thought I might.

248
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,325
So, what's new in sex?

249
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,238
What's new in sex?

250
00:16:05,272 --> 00:16:07,433
I've only been with your father.

251
00:16:07,475 --> 00:16:11,275
I'm dicing. I'm dicing. I don't hear anything.

252
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:16,282
This is no offense to your dad, but I was thinking there might be more.

253
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,478
I'm sorry. I can't have this conversation with you.

254
00:16:20,254 --> 00:16:20,549
All right.

255
00:16:21,288 --> 00:16:25,281
You come here and drop this bomb on me before you tell Daddy.

256
00:16:25,393 --> 00:16:29,261
Do you want my blessing? Want me to talk you out of it?

257
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,331
Then what do you want?

258
00:16:31,331 --> 00:16:33,299
I guess I figured you'd understand.

259
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,494
Why on earth would I understand this?

260
00:16:37,304 --> 00:16:39,499
You didn't marry your Barry, honey.

261
00:16:40,274 --> 00:16:42,504
But I married mine.

262
00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:52,418
We're in trouble. We only have 1 2 hours and 36 minutes left.

263
00:16:52,486 --> 00:16:54,317
Move, move, move!

264
00:16:54,522 --> 00:16:58,583
Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.

265
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:01,250
Joey, speed it up!

266
00:17:01,362 --> 00:17:06,265
I'm sorry! It's the pigs! They're reluctant to get in the blanket!

267
00:17:06,434 --> 00:17:10,234
How did this happen? You had this all planned out.

268
00:17:10,438 --> 00:17:13,236
Do you want me to cry?

269
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:17,333
Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?

270
00:17:17,445 --> 00:17:19,242
Sir, no, sir!

271
00:17:22,483 --> 00:17:23,472
All right, you!

272
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:27,448
No. Look, I told you, I am not a part of this thing.

273
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:32,316
I know you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you.

274
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:39,262
But if you don't help, I'll take those hot dogs and create an appetizer called ''Pigs In Ross.''

276
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:41,364
Ball a melon!

277
00:17:41,469 --> 00:17:45,496
How come I'm stuck dicing when he gets to ball a melon?

278
00:17:49,577 --> 00:17:51,027
How's it going?

279
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:52,477
Great! Right on schedule.

280
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,475
Got my little happy helpers.

281
00:17:56,517 --> 00:17:59,315
That's fine. Whatever.

282
00:17:59,386 --> 00:18:00,398
What's the matter?

283
00:18:00,398 --> 00:18:01,410
Nothing.

284
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:07,317
Okay, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.

285
00:18:08,229 --> 00:18:10,459
You're still gonna pay me, right?

286
00:18:12,266 --> 00:18:14,427
Or something a little less selfish.

287
00:18:15,236 --> 00:18:17,227
What's the matter? What happened?

288
00:18:17,271 --> 00:18:18,818
My parents said they weren't coming.

289
00:18:18,818 --> 00:18:20,365
Oh, my God.

290
00:18:20,441 --> 00:18:28,372
I knew they were having trouble with this but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away.

292
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:32,441
Susan and I fought because I said maybe we should call it off.

293
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,478
She said, ''This isn't for them. It's for us.''

294
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:39,487
And if I couldn't see that, maybe we should call it off.

295
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:42,354
I don't know what to do.

296
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:48,400
I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.

297
00:18:48,469 --> 00:18:50,300
You do?

298
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:54,364
Do you love her? And don't be too emphatic about this.

299
00:18:56,377 --> 00:18:57,469
Of course I do.

300
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,376
Well, then, that's it.

301
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:05,248
And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them.

302
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:11,457
If my parents didn't want me to marry you no way that would have stopped me.

304
00:19:12,226 --> 00:19:16,356
Look, this is your wedding. Do it.

305
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:21,232
You're right. Of course you're right.

306
00:19:21,335 --> 00:19:22,359
So we're back on?

307
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,328
We're back on.

308
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:27,465
You heard the woman! Peel! Chop! Devil!

309
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,345
Can't believe I lost two minutes!

310
00:19:42,456 --> 00:19:44,287
It just seems so futile.

311
00:19:44,358 --> 00:19:48,385
You know? All these women, and nothing!

312
00:19:50,464 --> 00:19:54,457
I feel like Superman without my powers, you know?

313
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:59,369
I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.

314
00:20:00,474 --> 00:20:05,377
Well, now you understand how I feel every single day. Okay?

315
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:09,415
The world is my lesbian wedding.

316
00:20:19,526 --> 00:20:21,289
Butterscotch?

317
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:26,525
No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.

318
00:21:01,402 --> 00:21:02,886
Thank you.

319
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,370
Anytime.

320
00:21:06,507 --> 00:21:07,496
Ross.

321
00:21:12,513 --> 00:21:18,474
Nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two, come together in love.

323
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:25,315
Friends, family, we're gathered here to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.

325
00:21:25,392 --> 00:21:26,484
Oh, my God!

326
00:21:26,527 --> 00:21:29,428
Now I've seen everything!

327
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,296
She's gone!

328
00:21:34,401 --> 00:21:36,426
She's gone! She's gone.

329
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,529
Go ahead, get married. Go, go!

330
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,932
Would you look at them?

331
00:21:50,932 --> 00:21:53,349
Yeah. Can't help but.

332
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:02,261
How's that pig in a blanket working out for you?

333
00:22:02,296 --> 00:22:04,560
I wrapped those bad boys.

334
00:22:06,266 --> 00:22:07,278
I miss Rose.

335
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:08,290
Oh, yeah?

336
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:13,363
I know it's kind of weird, but she was a big part of my life.

337
00:22:13,407 --> 00:22:15,500
I don't know, I feel alone.

338
00:22:16,276 --> 00:22:20,508
You know, I couldn't help overhearing what you just said.

339
00:22:21,415 --> 00:22:26,375
I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life.

340
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,854
How about we get you a drink?

341
00:22:28,854 --> 00:22:31,288
Okay. So nice!

342
00:22:38,298 --> 00:22:41,495
I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?

343
00:22:44,338 --> 00:22:45,532
Hey, Mom, you having fun?

344
00:22:46,306 --> 00:22:51,334
Am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman.

345
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:55,348
And three other girls made eyes at me over at the buffet.

346
00:22:55,416 --> 00:23:01,249
I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue but it's nice to have options.

348
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:06,291
There's more alcohol, right?

349
00:23:10,364 --> 00:23:12,355
How you doing?

350
00:23:12,466 --> 00:23:14,297
Okay.

351
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:18,304
You did a good thing today.

352
00:23:22,376 --> 00:23:24,372
You wanna dance?

353
00:23:24,372 --> 00:23:26,368
No, that's fine.

354
00:23:26,413 --> 00:23:28,278
Come on.

355
00:23:28,382 --> 00:23:30,373
I'll let you lead.

356
00:23:48,535 --> 00:23:53,336
Look, penis, schmenis! Okay? We're all people.

357
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:06,251
Which one of us will be the first one to get married?

358
00:24:06,353 --> 00:24:08,253
Mon, I was married.

359
00:24:08,355 --> 00:24:09,822
Yeah, me too, technically.

360
00:24:09,822 --> 00:24:11,289
I had a wedding.

361
00:24:11,358 --> 00:24:14,384
Just trying to start an interesting discussion.

362
00:24:14,461 --> 00:24:19,296
Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married?

363
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:23,902
Isn't Ben in this?

364
00:24:23,902 --> 00:24:25,301
Of course!

365
00:24:25,405 --> 00:24:27,396
Absolutely.
