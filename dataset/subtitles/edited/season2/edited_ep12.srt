1
00:00:09,298 --> 00:00:12,290
Can't get the monkey off your back?

2
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:16,403
Then put it in your mouth  with Monkeyshine Beer.

4
00:00:16,505 --> 00:00:19,338
Get it, monkey

5
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:22,343
Get it, get it, monkey

6
00:00:24,413 --> 00:00:25,505
Monkey, monkey

7
00:00:25,614 --> 00:00:27,411
Monkeyshine Beer.

8
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,509
'Cause it's a jungle out there.

9
00:00:30,319 --> 00:00:32,446
That commercial always makes me sad.

10
00:00:32,555 --> 00:00:38,359
But the guy opens his beer, the girls run at him so everything works out okay.

12
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:41,530
I meant, the monkey reminds me of Marcel.

13
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:43,320
I can see that.

14
00:00:43,365 --> 00:00:48,325
Because they both have those big brown eyes and the little pouty chin.

15
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,565
And the fact that they're both monkeys?

16
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,475
Did I do the right thing, giving him away?

17
00:00:54,543 --> 00:00:58,536
Ross, you had to. He was humping everything in sight.

18
00:00:59,348 --> 00:01:02,511
My Malibu Barbie won't be wearing white to her wedding.

19
00:01:05,354 --> 00:01:12,317
Remember when he'd borrow your hat and when you got it back, there'd be monkey raisins in it?

21
00:01:13,395 --> 00:01:14,419
He loved that joke.

22
00:01:14,497 --> 00:01:22,494
When he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss...suddenly I had this big attitude problem.

24
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,447
Hey, check it out. Guess what I got?

25
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:15,285
Rhythm?

26
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:18,316
No. My first fan mail.

27
00:02:20,396 --> 00:02:21,522
''Dear Dr. Ramoray:

28
00:02:22,298 --> 00:02:25,392
I love you and would do anything to have you.''

29
00:02:25,434 --> 00:02:29,302
My gosh. ''Your not-so-secret admirer, Erika Ford.''

30
00:02:30,306 --> 00:02:31,295
Oh, wait.

31
00:02:31,407 --> 00:02:35,537
''P.S. Enclosed, please find 1 4 of my eyelashes.''

32
00:02:37,413 --> 00:02:40,405
In Crazy World, that means you're married.

33
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:47,454
It's not addressed to Days of our Lives. It came to your apartment.

34
00:02:47,523 --> 00:02:49,019
She was in our building.

35
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:50,515
Oh, my God.

36
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,428
I got my very own stalker.

37
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:59,365
You're so lucky. I have to share with guys at work.

38
00:03:00,502 --> 00:03:06,304
Remember we talked about ''good thing, bad thing''? This is a bad thing.

39
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:08,271
Hey, guys.

40
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,266
Hey.

41
00:03:09,378 --> 00:03:10,504
Where are you off to?

42
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,475
There's a paleontology conference in L.A.

43
00:03:14,283 --> 00:03:18,276
I figured I'd go, drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel.

44
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:25,519
He will be surprised. Till he realizes he's a monkey and isn't capable of that emotion.

46
00:03:28,297 --> 00:03:30,492
Phoebe? That cute guy is here again.

47
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:36,598
Okay, so everyone pretend I'm telling a story. It's really funny.

49
00:03:37,339 --> 00:03:39,330
So everyone just laugh. Now!

50
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:42,409
I know, I know.

51
00:03:43,412 --> 00:03:44,509
Hello.

52
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:45,606
Hi.

53
00:03:46,348 --> 00:03:47,428
I'm Rob Donnen.

54
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:48,508
Hi, Rob Donnen.

55
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:53,317
I don't know a thing about music but I think you're great.

56
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:55,514
Oh! Wow.

57
00:03:55,557 --> 00:03:59,550
Anyway, I schedule performers for children's libraries.

58
00:04:00,296 --> 00:04:04,460
I was thinking, have you thought about playing your songs for kids?

59
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:14,374
I would love to have kids...hear me play the songs that I will write for them.

61
00:04:16,378 --> 00:04:18,278
What'll we do for dinner?

62
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,371
We could cook for ourselves.

63
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:28,381
-Hello.
-It's Erika.

64
00:04:28,524 --> 00:04:30,321
My God. The stalker!

65
00:04:30,426 --> 00:04:31,484
It's open.

66
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,491
Hit her with a frying pan. Good idea.

67
00:04:36,532 --> 00:04:40,491
But we want a backup plan, in case she isn't a cartoon.

68
00:04:42,304 --> 00:04:43,498
Let's get out of here.

69
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:48,533
The one time they're not home.

70
00:04:50,412 --> 00:04:55,349
We'll leave. When we pass her, she won't know it's me. We've never met.

71
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:59,617
That's how radio stars escape stalkers.

72
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,450
She's coming.

73
00:05:08,464 --> 00:05:10,261
It's me.

74
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:13,401
This is it. This is how we're gonna die.

75
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,394
You ready?

76
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:17,363
Wait, wait, wait.

77
00:05:26,315 --> 00:05:27,373
Erika!

78
00:05:37,426 --> 00:05:38,358
Mr. Geller?

79
00:05:38,358 --> 00:05:39,290
Yes, hi.

80
00:05:39,395 --> 00:05:41,522
Dean Lipson, zoo administrator.

81
00:05:42,331 --> 00:05:43,525
You had a question?

82
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:47,425
I can't find the monkey I donated last year.

83
00:05:47,503 --> 00:05:50,495
He's a capuchin, answers to the name Marcel?

84
00:05:51,407 --> 00:05:54,399
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

85
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,603
Marcel has passed on.

86
00:05:58,514 --> 00:06:01,347
Oh, my God! What happened?

87
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:06,344
He got sick, and then he got sicker then he got a little better.

89
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:08,382
But then he died.

90
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,386
I can't believe this.

91
00:06:12,494 --> 00:06:17,397
I'm sorry, Mr. Geller. But you know, there's an old saying:

92
00:06:17,499 --> 00:06:20,366
''Sometimes monkeys die.''

93
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:27,468
It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today.

95
00:06:28,277 --> 00:06:29,392
Someone should've called me.

96
00:06:29,392 --> 00:06:30,507
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,308
Look, I know this can't bring him back, but here. It's just a gesture.

98
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:39,316
Zoo dollars?

99
00:06:39,421 --> 00:06:43,482
Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats.

100
00:06:45,394 --> 00:06:48,386
It's cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.

101
00:06:57,339 --> 00:06:58,431
I know.

102
00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:04,377
I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What is she like?

103
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:07,279
Remember Kathy Bates in Misery?

104
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:10,375
Well, she looks the exact opposite of that.

105
00:07:11,386 --> 00:07:13,354
And she's not crazy?

106
00:07:13,455 --> 00:07:15,480
Oh, no. She's a total whack-job.

107
00:07:16,358 --> 00:07:20,351
She thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Ramoray.

108
00:07:20,462 --> 00:07:22,293
Oh, my God.

109
00:07:22,364 --> 00:07:26,300
And he's going out with her? He cannot pursue this.

110
00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:33,270
Just because she thinks she can truly see Joey through her magic box doesn't mean she's not a person.

112
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,367
Does she not deserve happiness or love?

113
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:41,472
Why are you looking at me? He wants to boff the maniac.

114
00:07:42,584 --> 00:07:44,313
Are you okay?

115
00:07:44,386 --> 00:07:46,320
No, I'm nervous.

116
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:49,481
Maybe if I picture them in their underwear....

117
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:54,285
That's not a good idea. That's why the last guy got fired.

118
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,325
I'm used to playing for grownups.

119
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:03,429
Grownups drink coffee, do their grownup thing.

120
00:08:04,273 --> 00:08:06,434
And kids listen.

121
00:08:08,243 --> 00:08:10,438
It's just a huge responsibility.

122
00:08:11,246 --> 00:08:12,235
What?

123
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:14,281
Are you gonna kiss me?

124
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,444
I was thinking about it.

125
00:08:17,386 --> 00:08:18,375
Okay.

126
00:08:21,456 --> 00:08:24,357
Alrighty. Let's play some tunes.

127
00:08:26,295 --> 00:08:29,287
Let's go find our seats. Chandler?

128
00:08:29,364 --> 00:08:31,355
Hold on a second.

129
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:33,359
He thinks he can.

130
00:08:35,304 --> 00:08:37,295
He thinks he can.

131
00:08:38,407 --> 00:08:40,398
Oh, what the hell?

132
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:42,409
He can.

133
00:08:44,413 --> 00:08:46,392
Hi, everybody. I'm Phoebe.

134
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,371
Hi, Phoebe!

135
00:08:51,386 --> 00:08:55,288
I'm gonna play some songs about grandparents, okay?

136
00:08:57,426 --> 00:09:00,418
Now Grandma's a person Who everyone likes

137
00:09:01,229 --> 00:09:04,221
She bought you a train And a bright shiny bike

138
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:07,268
But lately she hasn't Been coming to dinner

139
00:09:07,369 --> 00:09:11,430
And last time you saw her She looked so much thinner

140
00:09:11,473 --> 00:09:15,273
Now, your mom and your dad said She moved to Peru

141
00:09:15,344 --> 00:09:18,472
But the truth is she died And someday you will too

142
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:32,255
I'll have the grilled salmon.

143
00:09:32,361 --> 00:09:35,455
And the doctor will have the risotto.

144
00:09:36,498 --> 00:09:38,881
Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?

145
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:41,264
Yeah, it is.

146
00:09:42,371 --> 00:09:43,463
What?

147
00:09:44,473 --> 00:09:51,402
Well, here we sit, devil-may-care and a while ago you were re-attaching Simone's spinal cord.

149
00:09:51,513 --> 00:09:53,378
That was a tricky one.

150
00:09:55,317 --> 00:10:00,414
In reality, that operation takes 10 hours. They only showed two minutes.

151
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,290
Who's ''they''?

152
00:10:04,593 --> 00:10:06,390
No one.

153
00:10:07,596 --> 00:10:12,295
Drake, you are so talented. Let me see those hands.

154
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:14,528
These hands, these beautiful hands.

155
00:10:15,504 --> 00:10:17,495
I could just eat them.

156
00:10:18,306 --> 00:10:19,330
But I won't.

157
00:10:20,308 --> 00:10:22,401
Otherwise my watch would fall off.

158
00:10:28,417 --> 00:10:30,408
No, seriously.

159
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:35,346
These hands, these miracle, magical, life-giving hands.

160
00:10:35,424 --> 00:10:39,417
Just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?

161
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:42,520
All right. Just one.

162
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:54,341
You're good at that.

163
00:10:55,644 --> 00:10:57,976
Oh, my God! Someone, he's choking.

164
00:10:57,976 --> 00:11:00,308
Is anyone here a doctor?

165
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:05,409
Yes, the best doctor in Salem. Dr. Drake Ramoray.

166
00:11:21,503 --> 00:11:25,530
Meet me in the nocturnal house in 1 5 minutes.

167
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,506
Hey, look. I don't really enjoy being with other men that way.

168
00:11:34,349 --> 00:11:36,340
But...zoo dollars?

169
00:11:37,419 --> 00:11:39,410
It's about your monkey.

170
00:11:40,355 --> 00:11:41,617
It's alive.

171
00:11:56,371 --> 00:11:59,431
I don't understand. Why didn't you help that man?

172
00:12:00,308 --> 00:12:07,506
Because I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of ''foodal chokage.''

175
00:12:13,321 --> 00:12:15,312
I gotta tell you something--

176
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,517
No. You don't have to tell me anything.

177
00:12:18,326 --> 00:12:20,487
You don't have to explain yourself.

178
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:23,521
Who am I to question the great Dr. Ramoray?

179
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:25,846
I should be happy to be near you.

180
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,393
Hey, I--

181
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:32,498
Hey what?

182
00:12:33,308 --> 00:12:35,401
That's it. Just hey.

183
00:12:36,344 --> 00:12:38,403
Like at the end of a dance. ''Hey!''

184
00:12:46,321 --> 00:12:48,312
There'll be times when you get older

185
00:12:48,356 --> 00:12:52,417
When you'll want to sleep with people Just to make them like you

186
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,428
But don't!

187
00:12:54,563 --> 00:13:00,358
'Cause that's another thing that you don't wanna do Everybody!

189
00:13:00,468 --> 00:13:05,405
That's another thing That you don't wanna do

190
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:08,270
Excellent!

191
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,265
Very informative.

192
00:13:09,311 --> 00:13:11,472
Not at all inappropriate.

193
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,273
Thank you for coming. There are cookies in the back.

194
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:18,579
That was great.

195
00:13:19,321 --> 00:13:21,380
The kids loved you.

196
00:13:21,489 --> 00:13:23,423
I rock.

197
00:13:24,392 --> 00:13:27,327
You know why? Because you told the truth.

198
00:13:27,395 --> 00:13:29,386
Nobody tells kids the truth.

199
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:31,396
You were incredible.

200
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,489
But...?

201
00:13:34,336 --> 00:13:35,883
How'd you know there was a ''but''?

202
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:37,430
I sense things.

203
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:40,303
It was either ''but'' or ''butter.''

204
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:49,340
I think some of the parents.... They were hoping that you'd play songs about barnyard animals.

206
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:50,509
I can do that.

207
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:55,312
Really? Because that would be fantastic.

208
00:13:56,324 --> 00:13:58,451
What? You wanna kiss me?

209
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,357
I'm thinking about it.

210
00:14:03,498 --> 00:14:07,400
If I get a library card, can I take you out some time?

211
00:14:12,374 --> 00:14:15,366
What? I'm unemployed.

212
00:14:20,382 --> 00:14:22,282
The bat.

213
00:14:22,384 --> 00:14:24,375
Ambassador of darkness.

214
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:28,478
Flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger.

215
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:32,385
Sightless specter of the macabre.

216
00:14:33,495 --> 00:14:34,519
Buddy, my monkey?

217
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,293
Oh, yeah, right.

218
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,536
There was a break-in a few months back. Inside job.

219
00:14:44,306 --> 00:14:46,331
Your monkey was taken.

220
00:14:46,408 --> 00:14:53,342
Along with a snowy egret, a two-toed sloth and three sweatshirts from the zoo gift shop.

222
00:14:53,515 --> 00:14:56,507
But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.

223
00:14:57,352 --> 00:14:58,444
The zoo.

224
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,353
You believe everything the zoo tells you?

225
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:07,285
That's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.

226
00:15:07,462 --> 00:15:11,364
Of course they say that. They don't want bad publicity.

227
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:13,263
It's a big cover-up.

228
00:15:13,368 --> 00:15:16,462
Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?

229
00:15:17,272 --> 00:15:18,466
That guy Lipson?

230
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:20,467
Lipson knows?

231
00:15:21,376 --> 00:15:22,923
Who else knows?

232
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,470
I only know Lipson.

233
00:15:26,414 --> 00:15:28,382
Lipson knows, huh?

234
00:15:29,384 --> 00:15:30,578
Hello, Mr. Possum.

235
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:35,321
Enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night.

236
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,907
Taunting gravity--

237
00:15:36,907 --> 00:15:38,391
Buddy, my monkey?

238
00:15:40,395 --> 00:15:42,329
Word on the street--

239
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:46,423
When I say ''street,'' I mean those pretend streets here.

240
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:48,298
Of course.

241
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:56,340
Your monkey found a new career in the entertainment field. That's all I know.

243
00:15:57,412 --> 00:15:59,312
This is unbelievable!

244
00:15:59,414 --> 00:16:04,249
So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?

245
00:16:04,486 --> 00:16:07,387
Are you trying to get me to bribe you?

246
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:09,354
Maybe.

247
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,291
But you already told me everything.

248
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:24,363
Check it out.

249
00:16:24,506 --> 00:16:27,373
He actually is the Monkeyshine monkey.

250
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:31,274
What'll you do?

251
00:16:31,312 --> 00:16:34,406
I'll call the beer company and try to find him.

252
00:16:34,482 --> 00:16:37,508
That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.

253
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,317
Okay, hi again.

254
00:16:40,422 --> 00:16:43,289
Hi, Phoebe.

255
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:48,421
Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals.

256
00:16:49,531 --> 00:16:54,332
The cow in the meadow goes moo The cow in the meadow goes moo

257
00:16:54,402 --> 00:16:58,532
The farmer hits him and grinds him up And that's how we get hamburgers

258
00:17:01,543 --> 00:17:05,274
Now chickens!

259
00:17:06,281 --> 00:17:11,344
-You're the only one who can save her.
-Damn it. I'm a doctor. I'm not God.

260
00:17:11,453 --> 00:17:13,478
There goes my belief system.

261
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,349
It's Erika.

262
00:17:17,392 --> 00:17:19,326
Quick. Shut off the TV.

263
00:17:19,326 --> 00:17:21,260
I wanna see what happens.

264
00:17:21,362 --> 00:17:23,455
I get Leslie out of the coma. We kiss.

265
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:26,290
You were just kissing Sabrina.

266
00:17:26,401 --> 00:17:30,303
Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neurosurgeon.

267
00:17:33,475 --> 00:17:35,272
Hey, Erika. Come in.

268
00:17:35,343 --> 00:17:38,471
How'd you get here so fast? I just saw you in Salem.

269
00:17:38,513 --> 00:17:41,482
Right, they choppered me in.

270
00:17:42,317 --> 00:17:43,409
What's up?

271
00:17:43,485 --> 00:17:45,476
You're having a party too.

272
00:17:46,287 --> 00:17:47,299
Is she here?

273
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:48,311
Who?

274
00:17:48,423 --> 00:17:50,482
Sabrina. I know about you two.

275
00:17:51,292 --> 00:17:53,522
I saw you kissing in the doctor's lounge.

276
00:17:55,396 --> 00:17:57,330
It's not what you think--

277
00:17:57,398 --> 00:17:59,593
You told me I was the only one.

278
00:18:03,371 --> 00:18:05,305
All right, look. That's it.

279
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,431
We shouldn't see each other.

280
00:18:07,475 --> 00:18:12,336
I should have told you before but I am not Drake Ramoray.

282
00:18:12,447 --> 00:18:16,383
I'm not a doctor. I'm an actor. I pretend to be a doctor.

283
00:18:16,451 --> 00:18:20,251
Oh, my God. Do the people at the hospital know?

284
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:25,483
Somebody wanna help me out here?

285
00:18:26,261 --> 00:18:28,252
Oh, I know. I know.

286
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:30,260
Where am I?

287
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:34,394
University Hospital  where you've been for 18 years.

289
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,495
How can you be here and there?

290
00:18:38,373 --> 00:18:40,273
Because it's a TV show.

291
00:18:40,475 --> 00:18:42,375
What are you getting at?

292
00:18:44,379 --> 00:18:47,314
Nice girl. Not great with concepts.

293
00:18:48,383 --> 00:18:49,475
I'm not Drake.

294
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:55,515
That's right. He's not Drake. He's Hans Ramoray, Drake's evil twin.

296
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:03,320
Is this true?

297
00:19:03,464 --> 00:19:05,432
Yes. Yes, it is true.

298
00:19:06,234 --> 00:19:11,330
And I know this because he pretended to be Drake to sleep with me.

300
00:19:17,478 --> 00:19:20,379
And he told me he would run away with me.

301
00:19:20,481 --> 00:19:22,244
And he didn't.

302
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:27,345
And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard!

303
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,451
Is all this true?

304
00:19:37,498 --> 00:19:40,558
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

305
00:19:41,302 --> 00:19:43,361
You deserve much better than me.

306
00:19:43,404 --> 00:19:48,273
You deserve to be with the real Drake, who you fell in love with.

307
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:50,400
Go to Salem. Find him.

308
00:19:50,511 --> 00:19:52,479
He's the guy for you.

309
00:19:53,281 --> 00:19:54,407
Oh, Hans.

310
00:19:57,418 --> 00:19:58,407
Hans?

311
00:19:58,486 --> 00:19:59,475
Hans.

312
00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:03,323
Yo, evil twin!

313
00:20:03,524 --> 00:20:06,288
Right. Goodbye, Erika.

314
00:20:07,528 --> 00:20:09,496
Good luck in Salem.

315
00:20:10,498 --> 00:20:12,398
Take care.

316
00:20:12,433 --> 00:20:15,334
I'll never forget you, Hans.

317
00:20:19,507 --> 00:20:21,975
Okay, the people who threw the water!

318
00:20:21,975 --> 00:20:24,443
Helping you out.

319
00:20:24,512 --> 00:20:26,309
Fired?

320
00:20:26,447 --> 00:20:27,505
Why?

321
00:20:28,316 --> 00:20:33,310
The library board got complaints from parents about your songs.

322
00:20:33,521 --> 00:20:36,319
I can't believe it. The library?

323
00:20:36,424 --> 00:20:38,449
Books. Free speech.

324
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,043
Newspapers on sticks.

325
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:41,527
I know.

326
00:20:41,562 --> 00:20:47,432
And the kids? Did you tell your board that the kids want to hear the truth?

327
00:20:48,436 --> 00:20:49,528
No.

328
00:20:51,572 --> 00:20:53,369
I see.

329
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:57,434
Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs....

330
00:20:57,478 --> 00:21:04,479
No. What do you want me to be? Like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?

332
00:21:05,486 --> 00:21:07,386
You don't have to be Barney.

333
00:21:07,386 --> 00:21:09,286
Who's Barney?

334
00:21:15,396 --> 00:21:16,522
You'll never believe it.

335
00:21:17,332 --> 00:21:17,878
Let me guess.

336
00:21:17,878 --> 00:21:18,424
What?

337
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:22,299
Some Weebles actually do fall down?

338
00:21:22,503 --> 00:21:26,439
A stitch in time now only saves seven? What do you got?

339
00:21:27,508 --> 00:21:31,410
Well never mind.

341
00:21:31,546 --> 00:21:32,535
What? What?

342
00:21:33,348 --> 00:21:40,510
I tracked down Marcel. He's healthy, he's happy and he's in New York filming Outbreak 2: The Virus Takes Manhattan.

344
00:21:40,555 --> 00:21:42,318
You're kidding!

345
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:43,407
This is amazing.

346
00:21:43,407 --> 00:21:44,357
I know.

347
00:21:44,459 --> 00:21:47,622
I finally get on TV and the monkey's making movies.

348
00:21:49,564 --> 00:21:51,327
Rachel, I'm ready.

349
00:21:55,536 --> 00:22:00,303
Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is, who tells the truth?

350
00:22:00,575 --> 00:22:02,304
I guess that's me.

351
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:06,269
She's here!

352
00:22:14,322 --> 00:22:16,415
Sometimes men love women

353
00:22:16,491 --> 00:22:19,392
Sometimes men love men

354
00:22:19,494 --> 00:22:22,292
Then there are bisexuals

355
00:22:22,397 --> 00:22:26,299
Though some just say They're kidding themselves

356
00:22:35,443 --> 00:22:38,310
I haven't seen my monkey in a year.

357
00:22:38,413 --> 00:22:40,506
You never look down in the shower?

358
00:22:41,516 --> 00:22:45,509
I'm not allowed one joke in the ''monkey is penis'' genre?

359
00:22:46,354 --> 00:22:47,412
Back up, please.

360
00:22:47,522 --> 00:22:49,353
Back up. Come on.

361
00:22:49,424 --> 00:22:51,619
Excuse me. Where can we find the monkey?

362
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,520
It's a closed set.

363
00:22:53,561 --> 00:22:57,327
You don't understand. I'm a friend of his.

364
00:22:57,365 --> 00:22:59,424
We used to live together.

365
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:02,459
I have a timeshare in the Poconos with Flipper.

366
00:23:05,473 --> 00:23:06,462
There he is!

367
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,275
Hey! Buddy!

368
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:11,470
Marcel. Marcel!

369
00:23:18,386 --> 00:23:19,478
In the jungle

370
00:23:20,288 --> 00:23:21,516
The mighty jungle

371
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,485
The lion sleeps tonight

372
00:23:27,528 --> 00:23:30,497
In the jungle The mighty jungle

373
00:23:30,531 --> 00:23:33,500
The lion sleeps tonight

374
00:24:04,265 --> 00:24:05,459
Excuse me, this is a--

375
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,300
Closed set. We know. We're friends with the monkey.

376
00:24:11,405 --> 00:24:12,463
Good morning.

377
00:24:13,274 --> 00:24:16,402
Look who I brought! Your friend, Harry Elefante.

378
00:24:20,314 --> 00:24:23,283
Whoa, dude. Burn.

379
00:24:23,384 --> 00:24:27,286
I don't get it. He seemed so happy to see me yesterday.

380
00:24:27,388 --> 00:24:31,484
Don't take it personal. He's under pressure, starring in a movie.

381
00:24:33,394 --> 00:24:35,385
How big of a star is Marcel?

382
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:40,430
In human terms? I'd say Cybill Shepherd.

384
00:24:43,504 --> 00:24:47,440
So you guys in the movie or you just really paranoid?

385
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,299
Hey, Sal?

386
00:24:50,344 --> 00:24:51,891
Jerry's asking if the monkey's ready.

387
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:53,438
Excuse me?

388
00:24:53,548 --> 00:24:56,449
Jerry is the director? Which one's he?

389
00:24:56,517 --> 00:24:58,610
The one in the director's chair.

390
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,444
Gotcha.

391
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:02,369
Pheebs, walk with me.

392
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:03,449
Okay.

393
00:25:03,491 --> 00:25:06,358
Why am I walking with you?

394
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:12,459
We're going over here so we can get away from the horrible flesh-eating virus!

396
00:25:13,267 --> 00:25:15,360
For the love of God, listen to me!

397
00:25:15,469 --> 00:25:17,460
Is he looking? Is he looking?

398
00:25:24,412 --> 00:25:25,458
We've got a problem.

399
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:26,504
Tell me.

400
00:25:27,281 --> 00:25:30,580
Can't do Chris' makeup. She won't acknowledge her mustache.

401
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:32,849
Is it bad?

402
00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:34,379
It looks like her eyebrow fell down.

403
00:25:34,488 --> 00:25:39,482
Unless we convince her to bleach it, Van Damme will be kissing Gabe Kaplan.

404
00:25:41,295 --> 00:25:42,489
I'll talk to her.

405
00:25:43,331 --> 00:25:44,593
I hate actors.

406
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:49,492
Nice camouflage. For a minute, I almost didn't see you.

407
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,529
Excuse me.

408
00:25:56,611 --> 00:25:58,442
Is your name Chandler?

409
00:25:58,546 --> 00:25:59,945
Yes, it is.

410
00:25:59,945 --> 00:26:01,344
Chandler Bing?

411
00:26:01,382 --> 00:26:05,250
Do you know me or are you just good at this game?

412
00:26:05,386 --> 00:26:06,375
I'm Susie Moss.

413
00:26:07,288 --> 00:26:09,256
Fourth grade? Glasses?

414
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:12,484
I carried a box of animal crackers like a purse?

415
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,249
Susie Moss.

416
00:26:14,395 --> 00:26:16,363
Right. Yeah. Wow.

417
00:26:17,298 --> 00:26:18,390
You look....

418
00:26:19,266 --> 00:26:21,291
Great job growing up.

419
00:26:21,402 --> 00:26:25,498
It's nice to see you don't still wear the cap with the mirrors.

420
00:26:26,273 --> 00:26:29,504
I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp.

421
00:26:30,277 --> 00:26:31,471
Remember the class play?

422
00:26:31,512 --> 00:26:36,415
You pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants?

423
00:26:37,518 --> 00:26:42,285
Yes. Back then, I used humor as a defense mechanism.

424
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:44,483
Thank God I don't do that anymore.

425
00:26:46,527 --> 00:26:50,486
So? What have you been doing since childhood?

426
00:26:51,298 --> 00:26:54,290
Well, I got a new belt.

427
00:26:54,502 --> 00:26:55,491
I wondered.

428
00:27:00,274 --> 00:27:00,854
Oh, my God.

429
00:27:00,854 --> 00:27:01,434
What? What?

430
00:27:02,276 --> 00:27:04,244
It's Jean-Claude Van Damme.

431
00:27:04,345 --> 00:27:07,280
I didn't know he was in this. He is so hot.

432
00:27:07,448 --> 00:27:08,472
You think?

433
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,342
The Muscles from Brussels? Wham-Bam Van Damme?

434
00:27:12,453 --> 00:27:14,250
Did you see Timecop?

435
00:27:14,355 --> 00:27:16,403
No. Was he any good in it?

436
00:27:16,403 --> 00:27:18,451
Rachel, he totally changed time.

437
00:27:20,394 --> 00:27:22,453
So why don't you go talk to him?

438
00:27:23,497 --> 00:27:27,263
Go tell him he's cute. What could happen?

439
00:27:27,301 --> 00:27:28,359
He could hear me.

440
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,966
I'm doing it for you.

441
00:27:30,966 --> 00:27:32,462
Don't you dare. Don't.

442
00:27:32,573 --> 00:27:33,505
Don't!

443
00:27:34,408 --> 00:27:36,273
Tell him I cook.

444
00:27:37,378 --> 00:27:38,845
Excuse me. Hi.

445
00:27:38,845 --> 00:27:40,312
Hi.

446
00:27:41,282 --> 00:27:50,415
This is gonna sound kind of goofy...but my friend over there who cooks, by the way....

449
00:27:50,491 --> 00:27:52,391
She thinks you're cute.

450
00:27:52,426 --> 00:27:54,394
You don't think I'm cute?

451
00:27:56,297 --> 00:27:57,491
I don't know.

452
00:27:58,299 --> 00:27:59,527
Do you think you're cute?

453
00:28:02,236 --> 00:28:10,232
We're getting off the track. I was supposed to tell you my friend thinks you're cute. What should I tell her?

455
00:28:11,345 --> 00:28:15,475
You can tell her I think her friend is cute.

456
00:28:23,457 --> 00:28:26,392
Stephen Hurs would eat things for money.

457
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,485
David Stein had no elbows.

458
00:28:29,263 --> 00:28:31,458
Who got caught masturbating?

459
00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:36,300
That's not what he was doing. He was looking for his bus money.

460
00:28:37,571 --> 00:28:39,021
Makeup!

461
00:28:39,021 --> 00:28:40,471
That's me. I gotta go.

462
00:28:42,376 --> 00:28:43,468
Oh. Okay.

463
00:28:44,411 --> 00:28:49,371
How many times must I touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date?

464
00:28:51,385 --> 00:28:53,376
Well, let's try one more.

465
00:28:55,322 --> 00:28:57,313
There you go. Ernie's, 8:00?

466
00:28:57,424 --> 00:28:58,482
I'll be there.

467
00:28:59,293 --> 00:29:03,457
And if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear.

468
00:29:10,237 --> 00:29:12,262
No one was around to hear that?

469
00:29:17,344 --> 00:29:18,470
So, what did he say?

470
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,474
What a jerk!

471
00:29:21,248 --> 00:29:24,376
I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out.

472
00:29:26,554 --> 00:29:29,455
Naturally, you know, I said no.

473
00:29:32,459 --> 00:29:34,256
Thanks anyway.

474
00:29:34,295 --> 00:29:38,356
He just kept asking and asking, asking, asking....

476
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,300
If you want to go out with him, you can.

477
00:29:42,403 --> 00:29:44,462
Sounds like a jerk to me, but--

478
00:29:44,572 --> 00:29:48,303
Jean-Claude, she said yes. I'll see you tonight.

479
00:29:50,511 --> 00:29:52,376
Thank you.

480
00:29:58,485 --> 00:30:04,514
Then Jean-Claude took me to Crossroads where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.

482
00:30:05,292 --> 00:30:07,317
Oh, man. She's so smoking.

483
00:30:07,394 --> 00:30:09,328
She has the greatest set--

484
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,528
No guys around, huh?

485
00:30:16,403 --> 00:30:17,870
Anybody need anything?

486
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,337
I'll have espresso.

487
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,501
I'll get it. If I ask you, you'll end up drinking it yourself.

488
00:30:26,513 --> 00:30:27,525
That is so unfair.

489
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:28,537
I know.

490
00:30:29,316 --> 00:30:33,412
Like you'd drink her coffee after what you did with Van Damme?

491
00:30:34,421 --> 00:30:36,616
I have to cancel racquetball tonight.

492
00:30:37,358 --> 00:30:40,418
Marcel's trainer will let me have him for a while.

493
00:30:40,527 --> 00:30:42,478
You're blowing me off?

494
00:30:42,478 --> 00:30:44,429
We can reschedule for Saturday.

495
00:30:45,466 --> 00:30:48,435
Unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.

496
00:30:49,536 --> 00:30:53,431
Stick a fork in me...I am done.

498
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:56,492
Stick a fork what?

499
00:30:56,492 --> 00:30:58,443
Like when you're cooking a steak.

500
00:30:58,479 --> 00:31:00,310
I don't eat meat.

501
00:31:01,415 --> 00:31:03,576
How do you know when vegetables are done?

502
00:31:04,318 --> 00:31:07,310
You don't. You eat them and you can tell.

503
00:31:07,421 --> 00:31:09,321
Then eat me, I'm done.

504
00:31:12,526 --> 00:31:14,494
I've met the perfect woman.

505
00:31:14,595 --> 00:31:20,392
We're on her couch, fooling around and then she turns to me and says:

507
00:31:20,501 --> 00:31:23,299
''Ever want to do it in an elevator?''

508
00:31:24,338 --> 00:31:25,885
What did you say?

509
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:27,432
I believe my exact words were:

510
00:31:30,411 --> 00:31:32,009
How do you know if you wanna do that?

511
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:33,607
You just know.

512
00:31:43,424 --> 00:31:46,416
We gotta go. Got a reservation in 30 minutes.

513
00:31:47,428 --> 00:31:52,456
No. What I had planned shouldn't take more than two, three minutes, tops.

514
00:31:53,434 --> 00:31:56,528
Two hundred seconds of passion! We gotta go.

515
00:31:58,439 --> 00:32:02,274
But here's an idea.

517
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:06,311
Have you ever worn women's underwear?

518
00:32:07,314 --> 00:32:12,510
Well, yes, actually but they were my Aunt Edna's.

520
00:32:13,387 --> 00:32:16,288
And there were three of us in there.

521
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:23,386
I was thinking it would be kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight at dinner.

523
00:32:28,302 --> 00:32:30,395
You want me to wear your panties?

524
00:32:30,504 --> 00:32:31,528
Could you?

525
00:32:32,406 --> 00:32:36,433
If I wear your underwear, then what would you be wearing?

526
00:32:44,318 --> 00:32:46,309
You're swell.

527
00:32:49,556 --> 00:32:52,525
Got the music. Got the dinner.

528
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:57,556
I made Marcel's favorite dish, banana cake with mealworm.

530
00:33:02,503 --> 00:33:04,368
Candle.

531
00:33:05,305 --> 00:33:08,365
What do you think's gonna happen here tonight?

532
00:33:12,413 --> 00:33:13,402
Hello.

533
00:33:14,415 --> 00:33:16,474
Hi, are you on your way over--?

534
00:33:21,522 --> 00:33:25,424
No, I understand. A monkey's gotta work.

535
00:33:27,428 --> 00:33:33,298
It's no big deal. It's not like I had anything special planned.

536
00:33:34,334 --> 00:33:35,494
Yeah. Okay.

537
00:33:36,303 --> 00:33:37,497
Okay. Bye.

538
00:33:48,415 --> 00:33:50,508
I'm sorry, man.

539
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,435
Feel that?

540
00:33:54,435 --> 00:33:55,350
What?

541
00:33:55,422 --> 00:33:58,516
The moment we should have stopped holding hands?

542
00:34:01,562 --> 00:34:05,464
Rachel, why don't you start talking first?

543
00:34:05,499 --> 00:34:08,400
All right. This is totally unjustified.

544
00:34:08,502 --> 00:34:11,494
She gave me the green light. I did nothing--

545
00:34:14,274 --> 00:34:17,266
Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?

546
00:34:20,414 --> 00:34:23,383
If there is something you'd like to share--

547
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,315
You had no right.

548
00:34:25,419 --> 00:34:26,915
That's the most ridiculous--

549
00:34:26,915 --> 00:34:28,411
You sold me out.

550
00:34:28,489 --> 00:34:29,456
I did not.

551
00:34:29,456 --> 00:34:30,423
You absolutely--

552
00:34:30,491 --> 00:34:32,482
Would you let me talk?

553
00:34:35,496 --> 00:34:37,396
Did you just flick me?

554
00:34:39,299 --> 00:34:41,529
You wouldn't let me finish and I was--

555
00:34:43,403 --> 00:34:45,337
That hurt.

556
00:34:45,539 --> 00:34:46,597
Quit flicking.

557
00:34:47,341 --> 00:34:48,825
Stop flicking!

558
00:34:48,825 --> 00:34:50,309
You flicked me first!

559
00:34:56,483 --> 00:34:57,609
Let's not do this.

560
00:35:01,388 --> 00:35:04,255
Happy thoughts. Happy thoughts.

561
00:35:12,266 --> 00:35:14,257
Now I'm gonna kick some ass.

562
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:26,507
All right. Now, I will let go if you both stop.

563
00:35:27,514 --> 00:35:30,278
You want me to stop seeing him?

564
00:35:31,385 --> 00:35:34,479
You want me to tell him you're seeing him instead?

565
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:36,284
Is that what you want?

566
00:35:36,284 --> 00:35:37,279
Okay.

567
00:35:39,393 --> 00:35:41,327
That's what you want?

568
00:35:41,395 --> 00:35:43,295
Yes.

569
00:35:43,497 --> 00:35:44,896
Fine.

570
00:35:44,896 --> 00:35:46,295
Fine.

571
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,458
There we go.

572
00:35:48,535 --> 00:35:52,403
If we were in prison, you guys would be my bitches.

573
00:36:00,347 --> 00:36:02,298
Thanks for letting me tag along.

574
00:36:02,298 --> 00:36:04,249
Forget about it.

575
00:36:05,252 --> 00:36:07,243
How you doing there, squirmy?

576
00:36:07,387 --> 00:36:09,252
I'm hanging in.

577
00:36:09,389 --> 00:36:10,481
And a little out.

578
00:36:14,294 --> 00:36:16,489
So, assistant to the director?

579
00:36:17,364 --> 00:36:21,266
That's an exciting job. You must have responsibilities--

580
00:36:21,301 --> 00:36:22,427
I don't do the casting.

581
00:36:22,502 --> 00:36:25,266
What are you guys gonna eat?

582
00:36:26,473 --> 00:36:33,575
How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over?

584
00:36:35,515 --> 00:36:40,418
'Cause I went to an all-boys high school and God is making up for it?

585
00:36:48,495 --> 00:36:52,430
I want you right here right now.

587
00:36:52,499 --> 00:36:54,399
Right now, right here?

588
00:36:54,434 --> 00:36:57,403
Don't you think we're in a public place?

589
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,535
They do have the shrimp.

590
00:37:04,444 --> 00:37:06,435
Meet me in the bathroom.

591
00:37:13,253 --> 00:37:16,245
I'm going to the bathroom now.

592
00:37:23,497 --> 00:37:26,489
He likes to keep us in the loop.

593
00:37:33,473 --> 00:37:34,497
Come on.

594
00:37:37,411 --> 00:37:39,504
I can't believe we're doing this.

595
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,372
All right, mister.

596
00:37:41,515 --> 00:37:43,506
Let's see those panties.

597
00:37:45,285 --> 00:37:46,411
Alrighty.

598
00:37:50,324 --> 00:37:53,384
But you know what would be even sexier?

599
00:37:53,493 --> 00:37:54,482
What?

600
00:37:55,295 --> 00:37:58,492
If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.

601
00:38:01,234 --> 00:38:05,364
All right. Now, I would like to see you wearing nothing but them.

602
00:38:05,439 --> 00:38:08,237
Take your clothes off.

603
00:38:08,342 --> 00:38:12,472
I hope you realize we'll miss hearing about the specials.

604
00:38:14,381 --> 00:38:15,370
Come on, hurry.

605
00:38:15,482 --> 00:38:18,451
Do you want this done quick or done right?

606
00:38:19,286 --> 00:38:22,449
All right, turn around. I wanna see you from behind.

607
00:38:23,457 --> 00:38:27,450
Somebody's been doing his Buns of Steel video.

608
00:38:28,261 --> 00:38:31,389
So you want me to clench anything or...?

609
00:38:35,302 --> 00:38:36,394
Susie?

610
00:38:37,371 --> 00:38:38,463
Susie?

611
00:38:38,505 --> 00:38:41,269
This is for the 4th grade.

612
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:45,941
What do you mean?

613
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:47,471
What do I mean?

614
00:38:47,514 --> 00:38:50,381
I mean underpants, mister. That's what.

615
00:38:51,385 --> 00:38:53,285
What? What do you mean?

616
00:38:53,387 --> 00:38:57,389
My skirt you lifted. Kids laughing.

618
00:38:57,491 --> 00:39:00,324
I was Susie Underpants till I was 18.

619
00:39:02,229 --> 00:39:05,357
That was 4th grade. How could you still be upset?

620
00:39:06,433 --> 00:39:11,268
Call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.

621
00:39:16,343 --> 00:39:20,336
I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back.

622
00:39:29,456 --> 00:39:31,356
I can't believe this.

623
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:38,458
Just two weeks ago, I was watching Sudden Death and now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme.

625
00:39:38,498 --> 00:39:40,466
Can you beat up that guy?

626
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:43,432
Can you beat up that guy?

627
00:39:43,432 --> 00:39:44,495
Sure.

628
00:39:45,272 --> 00:39:47,263
This is so wild.

629
00:39:47,474 --> 00:39:52,468
I gotta admit, I was surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.

630
00:39:52,512 --> 00:39:54,480
Normally I would not do it.

631
00:39:56,383 --> 00:39:59,318
What made you make the exception for me?

632
00:39:59,386 --> 00:40:04,422
Rachel told me you wanted a threesome with me and Drew Barrymore.

634
00:40:04,491 --> 00:40:07,517
By the way, Drew has some ground rules and....

635
00:40:11,398 --> 00:40:12,365
Say you're sorry.

636
00:40:12,365 --> 00:40:13,332
No.

637
00:40:14,434 --> 00:40:15,930
Say it!

638
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,426
No! I'm not gonna.

639
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:21,500
Say it. Say it. Oh, great.

640
00:40:23,543 --> 00:40:26,535
Say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.

641
00:40:28,348 --> 00:40:31,511
That is my favorite sweater. My third-date sweater.

642
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,513
Say you're sorry.

643
00:40:36,456 --> 00:40:39,448
You wanna play? Okay, let's play.

644
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:41,527
Let's play.

645
00:40:46,433 --> 00:40:47,457
What'll you do?

646
00:40:47,567 --> 00:40:50,536
Give me my sweater or it's handbag marinara.

647
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,371
You don't have the guts.

648
00:40:55,642 --> 00:40:59,544
At least I wasn't too chicken to tell a guy he was cute.

649
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:13,282
Stop! Stop the madness!

650
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,395
This is crazy.

651
00:41:18,431 --> 00:41:21,423
Who can even remember why you're fighting?

652
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:27,431
Yes, that's right.

653
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:31,504
But still....

654
00:41:32,312 --> 00:41:33,404
Look at your purse.

655
00:41:34,514 --> 00:41:37,312
Look at your sweater.

656
00:41:37,517 --> 00:41:39,451
Look at yourselves.

657
00:41:43,523 --> 00:41:46,424
I'll help you fix your sweater.

658
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,462
I'll help you throw out your purse.

660
00:41:52,332 --> 00:41:54,459
I'm sorry I made you stop seeing him.

661
00:41:55,535 --> 00:41:59,471
I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him.

662
00:42:01,408 --> 00:42:04,377
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves.

663
00:42:25,298 --> 00:42:26,344
Joey?

664
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:27,390
Ma?

665
00:42:30,303 --> 00:42:31,395
Joey.

666
00:42:31,504 --> 00:42:32,528
Chandler?

667
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:36,503
You're still here? I thought you guys took off.

668
00:42:36,543 --> 00:42:39,307
She took off with my clothes.

669
00:42:40,313 --> 00:42:41,428
Are you naked in there?

670
00:42:41,428 --> 00:42:42,543
Well, not exactly.

671
00:42:44,417 --> 00:42:46,351
I'm wearing panties.

672
00:42:50,557 --> 00:42:52,525
You always wear panties?

673
00:42:54,327 --> 00:42:57,319
No, no. This is the first time.

674
00:42:58,331 --> 00:43:00,390
Wow! Talk about your bad luck.

675
00:43:01,468 --> 00:43:06,371
The first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.

676
00:43:07,307 --> 00:43:11,266
I was not trying them out. Susie asked me to wear them.

677
00:43:11,378 --> 00:43:12,470
Let me see.

678
00:43:12,512 --> 00:43:16,380
No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever.

679
00:43:16,483 --> 00:43:18,383
All right, all right.

680
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:25,481
Someone's flossing.

681
00:43:31,498 --> 00:43:34,399
Joey, some people don't like that.

682
00:43:35,535 --> 00:43:37,503
Chandler's wearing panties.

683
00:43:37,604 --> 00:43:40,004
What? Let me see.

684
00:43:40,004 --> 00:43:42,404
You don't have to see.

685
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:45,341
Hi, tushy.

686
00:43:46,613 --> 00:43:49,411
One of you give me your underpants.

687
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:52,511
Can't help you. I'm not wearing any.

688
00:43:53,553 --> 00:43:56,317
How can you not be wearing any?

689
00:43:56,423 --> 00:44:00,291
I'm getting heat from the guy in the hot pink thong.

690
00:44:01,294 --> 00:44:05,287
Look, Ross. I'll give you $50 for your underpants.

691
00:44:32,325 --> 00:44:33,422
Can I have the milk?

692
00:44:33,422 --> 00:44:34,519
I'm almost done.

693
00:44:35,328 --> 00:44:36,488
Keep your panties on.

694
00:44:43,336 --> 00:44:45,327
I'm in the movie!

695
00:44:45,438 --> 00:44:46,871
What happened?

696
00:44:46,871 --> 00:44:48,304
A victim called in sick.

697
00:44:48,408 --> 00:44:52,401
Cathy recommended me and boom! I'm dying on a gurney.

698
00:44:53,546 --> 00:44:57,539
Marcel finished his last scene if you want to say goodbye.

699
00:44:59,419 --> 00:45:03,355
That's okay. He's probably got parties to go to and stuff.

700
00:45:05,492 --> 00:45:09,360
He's moved on. That's the way it goes, right?

701
00:45:11,297 --> 00:45:12,394
Oh, my God.

702
00:45:12,394 --> 00:45:13,491
What?

703
00:46:02,248 --> 00:46:05,376
Sorry it didn't work out between us. Or us.

704
00:46:05,485 --> 00:46:08,386
Drew was very disappointed.

705
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:12,383
Okay. Well, bye.

706
00:46:17,363 --> 00:46:18,352
Goodbye.

707
00:46:20,366 --> 00:46:22,493
Well, bye for me too.

708
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:32,401
Okay. Well, bye-bye again.

709
00:46:35,515 --> 00:46:37,278
Okay.

710
00:46:38,484 --> 00:46:41,385
Perhaps the three of us just could:

711
00:46:41,487 --> 00:46:43,421
Oh, no, no, no, no.

712
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:47,316
Are you sure? I can crush a walnut with my butt.

713
00:46:47,393 --> 00:46:48,940
Oh, no, no, no. Impressive.

714
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,487
But no.

715
00:46:51,297 --> 00:46:52,491
Maybe if I were baking.

716
00:46:53,399 --> 00:46:55,492
Okay. Bye-bye.

717
00:47:00,373 --> 00:47:01,533
Bye, Marcel.

718
00:47:02,342 --> 00:47:04,333
See you on the big screen.

719
00:47:05,245 --> 00:47:08,442
You keep people drinking that beer, okay?

720
00:47:08,481 --> 00:47:10,381
I'll miss you, buddy.

721
00:47:17,257 --> 00:47:18,349
Bye.

722
00:47:32,405 --> 00:47:35,465
I think I want to write a song about all this.

723
00:47:37,277 --> 00:47:40,405
Except one of the strings on my guitar is broken.

724
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,472
Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?

725
00:47:43,583 --> 00:47:45,534
How long you been waiting to say that?

726
00:47:45,534 --> 00:47:47,485
About 20 minutes!

727
00:47:54,294 --> 00:47:57,422
Can't you see what's going on here? This man is dying!

728
00:47:59,332 --> 00:48:00,264
Cut!

729
00:48:01,234 --> 00:48:04,431
Can't you see what's going on here? This man is dying!

730
00:48:06,372 --> 00:48:07,430
Cut!

731
00:48:09,242 --> 00:48:12,473
Can't you see what's going on here? This man is dying!

732
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:16,280
Mommy!

733
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:20,344
Can't you see what's going on? This man is dead!
