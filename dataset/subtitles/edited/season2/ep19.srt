1
00:00:08,274 --> 00:00:10,242
Hey, Eddie.

2
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:13,408
What are you doing here?

3
00:00:13,408 --> 00:00:15,438
Watching you sleep.

4
00:00:15,482 --> 00:00:17,461
Why?

5
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:19,440
It makes me feel peaceful.

6
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:21,351
Please.

7
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:22,838
I can't sleep now!

8
00:00:22,838 --> 00:00:24,288
You want me to sing?

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,354
That's it. I want you out of the apartment now!

10
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,388
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,490
Hannibal Lecter.

12
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:37,493
Better roommate than you.

13
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:42,307
You're not fair! One night you see me and you get scared.

14
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,469
What about the other nights when you don't see me?

15
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,373
Last night when you got water, I was nice enough to hide behind the door.

16
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,512
I didn't realize that.

17
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,479
Get out now!

18
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:58,974
You really want me out?

19
00:00:58,974 --> 00:01:00,424
Yes, please.

20
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,422
I wanna hear you say you want me out.

21
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,346
I want you out.

22
00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:07,229
I wanna hear it from your lips.

23
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:11,235
Where did you hear it from before?

24
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:15,367
All right. Consider me gone. I'll move into my brother's basement.

25
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:19,276
When he finds out, I'll go find someplace else.

26
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:23,372
I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow.

27
00:01:24,284 --> 00:01:25,381
-Thank you.

28
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:26,478
I heard that.

29
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:17,431
Hey.

30
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:18,426
Hey.

31
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,433
Well, look at you!

32
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,233
Finally got that time machine working, huh?

33
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:28,337
This guy was selling them on 8th Avenue and I thought:

34
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:29,865
''You know what I don't have?''

35
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:31,349
A mirror?

36
00:02:32,385 --> 00:02:35,286
Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty.

37
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:40,257
For a guy who just lost his job, you're in a good mood.

38
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,454
I'll be all right. I'm not starting from square one.

39
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:47,489
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray on Days of our Lives.

40
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:51,361
That's gotta have some kind of cachet.

41
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:53,372
''Cachet''? ''Jaunty''?

42
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:57,307
Chandler gave me word-of-the-day toilet paper.

43
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,312
I'm gonna get some coffee.

44
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:06,310
Go on. You know you want to.

45
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,320
No.

46
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,315
No?

47
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:15,841
Hey.

48
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:16,421
Hey.

49
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,424
So? Did you read the book?

50
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,257
Oh, my God. It was incredible.

51
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,427
Didn't it totally speak to you?

52
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,334
What book?

53
00:03:25,334 --> 00:03:26,431
You have to read this book.

54
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,441
It's called Be Your Own Wind Keeper.

55
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,337
It's about how women need to become more empowered.

56
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,472
But there's wind.

57
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,351
And the wind can make us goddesses.

58
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:43,378
But do you know who takes our wind? Men. They just take it.

59
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,452
Men just take our wind?

60
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,262
All the time. Because they are the lightning-bearers.

61
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,365
Wow.

62
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,394
That sounds kind of cool. It's like The Hobbit.

63
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,234
It's nothing like The Hobbit.

64
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:04,333
It's like reading about all my relationships. Except Richard.

65
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,378
Richard would never steal your wind.

66
00:04:06,378 --> 00:04:08,312
No.

67
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,781
Because he's yummy.

68
00:04:09,781 --> 00:04:11,214
Yes.

69
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:13,217
But all the other ones....

70
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,346
And how they're always drinking from our pool of inner power.

71
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,840
But God forbid we should take a sip.

72
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,257
Anybody want a cruller?

73
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:25,354
This is a typical lightning-bearer thing.

74
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:30,368
It's like, ''Hello. Who wants one of my phallic-shaped man-cakes?''

75
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,269
Who have you been dating?

76
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,444
Don't worry about it. Things happen.

77
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,483
So you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?

78
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:57,286
Joey, look at me.

79
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,294
Look at me!

80
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:04,203
Do I have lipstick on my teeth?

81
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,430
No. Can we get back to me?

82
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:13,338
Look, honey. People get fired left and right in this business.

83
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,314
I got you an audition for Another World.

84
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:19,207
All right.

85
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,412
''Cab Driver Number 2''?

86
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,413
You're welcome.

87
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,424
But I was Dr. Drake Ramoray.

88
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:30,354
How can I go from a neurosurgeon to driving a cab?

89
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:36,265
Hey. There was a time when I played tickle-pickle with Rex Harrison.

90
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,331
Things change. Roll with them.

91
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,432
But this is a two-line part.

92
00:05:44,243 --> 00:05:49,237
It's like taking a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this.

93
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:57,345
Joey I'll tell you the same thing I told AI Minser and his pyramid of dogs.

95
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:02,387
Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor.

96
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,388
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:07,422
See you.

98
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,393
God!

99
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,228
Oh, God! I mean, it's just so....

100
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,204
Isn't it?

101
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:18,206
It's like reading about my own life.

102
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:22,407
This book could have been called, ''Be Your Own Wind Keeper, Rachel.''

103
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:27,448
It wouldn't sell a million copies. But it would've made a nice gift for you.

104
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:28,867
Hey, you guys.

105
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:29,413
Hey.

106
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,520
Sweetie, we've got to go.

107
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:33,247
No!

108
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,350
No?

109
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:41,366
Why do we always have to do everything according to your timetable?

110
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:45,370
Actually, it's the movie theater that has the timetable.

111
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,338
It's so you don't miss the beginning.

112
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:54,279
This isn't about the movie theater. This is about you stealing my wind.

113
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,476
You go, girl!

114
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:04,220
I can't pull that off, can I?

115
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,382
Excuse me, your wind?

116
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,292
Yes, my wind.

117
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:13,388
How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?

118
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:27,211
You know I don't...have a problem with that.

120
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:41,419
I just really need to be with myself right now.

121
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,328
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,365
You're right. I don't have to apologize.

123
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,232
Sorry. Damn it!

124
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,392
What is it?

125
00:07:57,392 --> 00:07:58,342
I don't know.

126
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:03,178
It's got all this stuff about wind and trees and a sacred pool.

127
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:06,308
I don't get it. But she's upset about it.

128
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:10,185
This is why I don't date women who read.

129
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,402
Uh-oh.

130
00:08:12,402 --> 00:08:13,414
What's that?

131
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:19,194
It's my Visa bill. Envelope one of two.

132
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,316
That can't be good.

133
00:08:22,316 --> 00:08:24,199
Open it, open it.

134
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,304
Oh, my God.

135
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,234
Look at this. How did I spend so much money?

136
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:36,404
That's just the minimum amount due. That's your total due.

137
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:41,482
Thirty-five hundred dollars at ''Porcelain Safari''?

138
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,314
My animals.

139
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:49,417
The guy said they suited me. He spoke with an accent. I was confused.

140
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:51,321
What am I gonna do?

141
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,422
Start by driving a cab on Another World.

142
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:55,417
What?

143
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:56,367
That audition?

144
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,369
That's a two-line part.

145
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:02,407
Joey, you owe $1 100 at ''I Love Lucite.''

146
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,271
So what?

147
00:09:04,271 --> 00:09:05,266
So suck it up, man.

148
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,278
It's a job. It's money.

149
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:12,182
I don't need you getting judgmental and condescending and pedantic.

150
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,382
Toilet paper?

151
00:09:13,382 --> 00:09:14,479
Yeah.

152
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,381
I'm not any of those. I'm being realistic.

153
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:20,909
You're supposed to be my friend.

154
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:22,393
I am.

155
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:26,392
Then tell me things like, ''You'll be fine.''

156
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,928
''Something big's coming. I know it!''

157
00:09:27,928 --> 00:09:29,424
I don't.

158
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:34,434
What I do know is you owe $2300 at ''Isn't It Chromantic?''

159
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,208
I'm aware of what I owe.

160
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,212
Then get some sense. It took 10 years to get that job.

161
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,827
How long till the next?

162
00:09:42,827 --> 00:09:44,340
I don't wanna hear it!

163
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,913
I'm just saying--

164
00:09:45,913 --> 00:09:47,409
Well, don't just say!

165
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,803
Maybe I should just go.

166
00:09:51,803 --> 00:09:53,350
Okay.

167
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,361
Okay. I'll see you later.

168
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,314
Just think about it.

169
00:09:59,314 --> 00:10:01,265
I don't need to think about it!

170
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:05,430
I was Dr. Drake Ramoray! That was huge!

171
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:10,231
Big things are gonna happen! You'll see! Ross?

172
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,436
You still there?

173
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,368
Hey, pal!

174
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,938
What are you still doing here?

175
00:10:40,938 --> 00:10:43,372
Dehydrating fruits and vegetables.

176
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,468
Man alive, this thing's fantastic!

177
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,393
Aren't you forgetting anything?

178
00:10:49,393 --> 00:10:51,406
Right. I got us a new goldfish.

179
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,282
He's feistier than the last one.

180
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,279
Maybe because the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm.

181
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:02,225
Isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing?

182
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:09,258
Not unless it's got to do with dehydrating. Right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!

184
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,530
Look, we had a deal. I thought by the time I got--

185
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:15,467
You know what that is?

186
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:19,234
Your last roommate's kidney?

187
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,245
That's a tomato.

188
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,441
This one definitely goes in the display.

189
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:36,261
Hey, Gunther. Let me get a lemonade to go.

190
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:39,387
Lemonade? You okay, man?

191
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:44,462
It's career stuff. They killed off my character on the show.

192
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,465
That's too bad. How'd they do it?

193
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,474
I fell down an elevator shaft.

194
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:54,269
That sucks. I was buried in an avalanche.

195
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,448
What?

196
00:11:57,448 --> 00:11:59,382
I was Bryce on All My Children.

197
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,432
Why must everybody watch me sleep?

198
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:27,276
No more watching me sleep! No more...watching!

199
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:42,384
I got new stuff to dehydrate. I got some grapes and apricots.

200
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:46,295
I thought it'd be cool to do water balloons.

201
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:49,390
Get out. Get out, get out, get out!

202
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:51,900
What?

203
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,497
You. Move out!

204
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:57,265
Take your fruit. Your stupid small fruit and get out!

205
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,310
You want me to move out?

206
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:12,222
I gotta tell you, that's kind of out of the blue.

207
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:18,419
This is not out of the blue. This is smack-dab in the middle of the blue!

208
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,223
Relax! Take it easy, buddy!

209
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,235
You don't have to tell me twice.

210
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:28,238
Someone will be by for my stuff.

211
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:37,279
If you think I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane!

212
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:38,896
You want some help?

213
00:13:38,896 --> 00:13:40,443
No help required, chico!

214
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,251
You don't see that every day.

215
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:57,299
''All the way to the airport? That's over 30 miles.''

216
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:00,395
''That's gonna cost you about so bucks.''

217
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,232
Excuse me, that's 50 bucks.

218
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,806
What?

219
00:14:05,806 --> 00:14:07,302
Five-O dollars.

220
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:12,340
You know what it is? It's smudgy because they're fax pages.

221
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:19,449
When I was on Days of our Lives as Dr. Drake Ramoray they'd send over the whole script on real paper.

223
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,453
That's great.

224
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:31,531
If you wanted to expand this scene, like have the cab crash I could attend to the victims. I have a background in medical acting.

226
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,250
Thanks for coming in.

227
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,229
Don't thank me for coming in.

228
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,467
At least let me finish.

229
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,372
''We could take the expressway.''

230
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,443
''But this time of day, you're better off taking the budge.''

231
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,259
You were going for ''bridge,'' weren't you?

232
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,285
I'll have a good day.

233
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:04,300
Honey, I know you didn't mean to. I know, me too.

234
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:08,237
Hang up. You're supposed to be taking a goddess quiz.

235
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:13,310
You should lose 100 points for calling your boyfriend in the middle of it.

236
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,408
Question 28.

237
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:23,454
''Have you ever allowed a lightning-bearer to take your wind?''

238
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,323
I would have to say no.

239
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,427
And I would have to say:

240
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:32,947
What?

241
00:15:32,947 --> 00:15:34,431
You don't remember the puppet guy?

242
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:39,460
You totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.

243
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,240
And his puppet too!

244
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:49,474
At least I didn't let a guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date!

246
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:53,798
Who?

247
00:15:53,798 --> 00:15:54,344
Paul!

248
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:55,478
Oh.

249
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:59,349
Moving on. Next question.

250
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,187
Okay, number 29.

251
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:07,299
''Have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning-bearer?'' Number 30.

253
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,302
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let's go back to 29.

254
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,306
Not to my recollection.

255
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:22,441
Danny Arshak, ninth grade. You know the bottle was pointing at me.

256
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:27,217
Only because you took up half the circle.

257
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:33,357
Listen to you two. It's so sad.

258
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:37,361
Looks like I'll be going to the goddess meetings alone.

259
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:44,430
Not if they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.

261
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,268
Only an hour?

262
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:50,272
You are such a leaf-blower!

263
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:51,907
Pool-drainer.

264
00:16:51,907 --> 00:16:53,272
Twig-snapper.

265
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,368
Monkey butt.

266
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,266
That isn't in the book.

267
00:16:58,266 --> 00:16:59,250
No.

268
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,309
But that's what you are.

269
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:18,201
Careful with that 3-D Last Supper. Judas is a little loose.

270
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,432
Oh, my God! What's going on?

271
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:29,244
They're taking all my stuff back. You were right.

272
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:33,250
I wasn't right. That's what I came here to tell you.

273
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:37,253
I was hung up on my own stuff the other day.

274
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:41,258
No, listen. I need the whole security thing, you know?

275
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:45,422
To know where my next paycheck is coming from. You don't need that.

276
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:50,258
That's amazing to me. I could never do what you do.

277
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:52,383
Thanks.

278
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,463
Hold out for something bigger.

279
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:59,301
I have so much respect for you for not going to that cab driver audition.

280
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:00,293
I went.

281
00:18:00,293 --> 00:18:01,208
Great! How was it?

282
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,345
I didn't get it.

283
00:18:03,345 --> 00:18:05,210
Good! You're living the dream!

284
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,376
Huh?

285
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,414
All right, then!

286
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,486
Not my parrot.

287
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,291
I can't watch this.

288
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,389
Hey, hold on, hold on.

289
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,198
How much for the--? How much to save the bird?

290
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:22,898
Twelve hundred.

291
00:18:22,898 --> 00:18:23,495
Dollars?

292
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,497
You spent $1 200 on a plastic bird?

293
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,207
It was an impulse buy near the register.

294
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,207
Go ahead with the bird.

295
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:36,338
Do you have anything for around $200?

296
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,308
The dog.

297
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,412
Yeah.

298
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,414
I'll take it. My gift to you, man.

299
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,319
Thanks, Ross!

300
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,227
I really liked that bird, though.

301
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,232
But the dog!

302
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:05,772
Here are your cakes.

303
00:19:05,772 --> 00:19:07,268
We didn't order cake.

304
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:11,210
No, I know. They're from me.

305
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:18,279
This isn't good. We have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking each other's.

307
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,220
You're right.

308
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,387
I love you goddesses.

309
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,299
I don't ever want to suck your wind again.

310
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,264
Thank you. So are we good?

311
00:19:30,264 --> 00:19:31,327
We're good.

312
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:32,368
We're good?

313
00:19:32,368 --> 00:19:33,300
Yes.

314
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:37,398
Let me take these back. They'll take it out of my paycheck.

315
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:41,402
Ding-dong, the psycho's gone!

316
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,269
Are you sure this time?

317
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:50,220
Yes. I actually saw him leave.

318
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:55,350
That guy is standing in the window holding a human head!

319
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:02,323
I tore it off some mannequin in the alley behind Macy's.

320
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,232
There's no alley there.

321
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,363
I got in the junior miss department. Big diff.

322
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,441
It can be at our next cocktail party.

323
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:13,444
''Our next cocktail party''?

324
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,442
We'll put chips in it. We'll make it a chip chick.

325
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,343
Do you remember yesterday?

326
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:25,548
Yes, I think I vaguely recall it.

327
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:32,486
Do you remember talking to me yesterday?

328
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,494
Yes.

329
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:40,984
What happened?

330
00:20:40,984 --> 00:20:42,497
We took a road trip to Las Vegas.

331
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,367
Oh, sweet Moses!

332
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:49,312
On this road trip, you win any money?

333
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:53,374
I crapped out. But Mr. 21 here! He cleans up! $300!

334
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,464
He buys me these new shoes.

335
00:20:54,464 --> 00:20:55,510
Nice.

336
00:20:57,322 --> 00:21:00,257
See you upstairs. See you, pals.

337
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:06,254
Is anyone else starting to really like him?

338
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:27,479
May I help you?

339
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:32,355
Why doesn't my key work, and why's my stuff downstairs?

340
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,256
I'm sorry.

341
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,352
Have we met?

342
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,396
It's Eddie, you freak! Your roommate.

343
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:44,358
I'm sorry I already have a roommate.

345
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,460
Hello.

346
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:55,574
He's lived here for years. I don't know what you're talking about.

347
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:02,248
No. He moved out and I moved in.

348
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:07,256
Well, I think we'd remember something like that.

349
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,351
I know I would.

350
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,353
That's a good point.

351
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:14,220
Okay, wow.

352
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,235
I guess I got the wrong apartment.

353
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:20,837
I'm terribly sorry.

354
00:22:20,837 --> 00:22:22,236
Hey, no problem.

355
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,330
See you.

356
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:33,474
Goodbye, you fruit-drying psychopath.

357
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:36,465
You want me to help you unpack?

358
00:22:36,465 --> 00:22:38,444
No, I'm okay.

359
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,449
Just so you know, I'm not moving back because I have to.

360
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:45,395
I mean, I do have to, but....

361
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:48,489
It's just that that place, it wasn't really....

362
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:51,360
I mean, this is....

363
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,362
Welcome home, man.

364
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:04,811
A little foos?

365
00:23:04,811 --> 00:23:06,307
Absolutely.

366
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,345
What happened to the foosball?

367
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:12,252
It's a cantaloupe.

368
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:20,355
Are we bringing this out every time Ross comes?

369
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:23,367
He paid a lot of money for it.

370
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:31,374
I'm gonna hold him a different way.

371
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:35,541
If you hated it so much, why did you buy it?

372
00:23:36,281 --> 00:23:39,478
I had a whole ceramic zoo thing going over there.

373
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,480
But without the others, it looks tacky.

374
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:47,247
Yeah. With things like this, more is always better.

375
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:53,262
Is he housetrained or will he leave little bathroom tiles all over?

376
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,356
Stay.

377
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,297
Stay!

378
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,462
Good fake dog.
