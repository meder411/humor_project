1
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,403
I'll get candles

2
00:00:08,403 --> 00:00:09,466
and my mom's tablecloth.

3
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:12,773
And since it's Rachel's birthday,

4
00:00:12,773 --> 00:00:15,270
I thought I'd poach a salmon.

5
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,372
What?

6
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:18,445
Question: Why do we always

7
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:20,441
have parties where you poach things?

8
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,387
Wanna be on the food committee?

9
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:23,951
Question two: Why do we

10
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:25,447
have committees?

11
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:28,271
Why can't we just get pizzas

12
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:30,250
and beers and have fun?

13
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,359
Fancy parties are only fun

14
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:34,355
if you're fancy on the inside.

15
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:37,370
And I'm not sure we are.

16
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,268
You don't want it to be special.

17
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:41,436
You can throw

18
00:00:41,436 --> 00:00:42,499
any kind of party you want.

19
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,402
Joey, they're not real!

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,827
I start miles beneath these things.

21
00:00:48,827 --> 00:00:50,374
They're fake.

22
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,284
See? Honk, honk!

23
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,583
Wow, it's like porno for clowns!

24
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,305
Neither of Rachel's sisters can come.

25
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:49,938
I have to invite Dylan

26
00:01:49,938 --> 00:01:51,502
and Emma and Shannon Cooper.

27
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:53,996
No Shannon Cooper.

28
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:55,480
Why not her?

29
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,379
Because she....

30
00:01:57,379 --> 00:01:58,476
She steals stuff.

31
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,869
Or maybe she doesn't and Joey slept

32
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,417
with her and never called her back.

33
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,455
Joey, that is horrible.

34
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,295
Hey, I liked her, all right?

35
00:02:12,295 --> 00:02:14,360
Maybe too much. I don't know.

36
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,231
I guess I just got scared.

37
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,239
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

38
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,754
I didn't think anyone

39
00:02:22,754 --> 00:02:24,267
would buy that. Okay!

40
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,876
Hi, honey. How'd it go?

41
00:02:26,876 --> 00:02:28,474
It was the graduation from hell.

42
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,864
My cousin went to hell

43
00:02:30,864 --> 00:02:32,479
on a football scholarship.

44
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,446
It's supposed to be a joyous occasion.

45
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,984
Nobody thought my sister

46
00:02:36,984 --> 00:02:38,480
would graduate.

47
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,374
It's a testament to what a girl

48
00:02:41,374 --> 00:02:43,456
from Long Island will do for a Celica.

49
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,410
What happened?

50
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,456
My parents happened.

51
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,033
All they had to do was sit

52
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:51,833
and smile and not talk about the divorce.

54
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,363
But no!

55
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:54,890
They fought during

56
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,374
the commencement address.

57
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,910
Bishop Tutu actually had

58
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,344
to stop and shush them.

59
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,246
You know the good news?

60
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:05,830
I get to serve coffee

61
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,343
for eight hours.

62
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,315
So we don't invite her parents.

63
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,790
How about just her mom?

64
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,223
Why her mom?

65
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,420
Because I already invited her.

66
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,463
Did you ask Stacy Roth?

67
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,358
Can't invite her.

68
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:26,237
She also steals.

69
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,437
So does her roommate.

70
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,366
Here are the candles.

71
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:40,481
Where's the cake?

72
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,802
We're not having birthday cake.

73
00:03:43,802 --> 00:03:46,350
We're having birthday flan.

74
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,284
Excuse me?

75
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,328
It's a Mexican custard dessert.

76
00:03:50,328 --> 00:03:52,262
That's nice.

77
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,879
Happy birthday, Rachel.

78
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,460
Here's some goo!

79
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,307
Dr. Greene!

80
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,309
Oh, my God!

81
00:04:05,309 --> 00:04:07,209
It's Rachel's dad.

82
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,313
What are you doing here?

83
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,865
A father can't see

84
00:04:10,865 --> 00:04:12,315
the daughter on her birthday?

85
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,320
No, no, the father can.

86
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,333
But since I'm the roommate,

87
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,312
I can tell you she's not here.

88
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,937
And I'll pass along the message.

89
00:04:19,937 --> 00:04:21,450
So bye-bye.

90
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,355
You're having a party.

91
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,227
No, no, not a party.

92
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:28,283
Just a surprise gathering

93
00:04:28,283 --> 00:04:30,234
of some people Rachel knows.

94
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,902
This is Phoebe, Chandler and Joey.

95
00:04:31,902 --> 00:04:33,534
I won't remember that.

96
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,365
So what's the deal?

97
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,427
Rachel comes home,

98
00:04:38,427 --> 00:04:40,378
people pop out and yell stuff?

99
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,397
This isn't your first

100
00:04:42,397 --> 00:04:44,348
surprise party, is it, sir?

101
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,244
Hi, Monica.

102
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,953
The Chinese menu guy.

103
00:04:52,953 --> 00:04:54,449
Forgot the menus.

104
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:58,396
So basically, just a Chinese guy.

105
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,796
Dr. Greene, come with me.

106
00:05:01,796 --> 00:05:04,293
We'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed.

107
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,201
All right.

108
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:10,197
That sounds like a two-person job.

109
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,391
Well, my goodness!

110
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:14,437
What was that?

111
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:16,812
I thought you were Rachel.

112
00:05:16,812 --> 00:05:18,410
We weren't ready for you yet.

113
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,469
You thought I was Rachel?

114
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:22,420
Because you look so young.

115
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,871
And because you're both,

116
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:27,220
you know, white women.

117
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,792
Oh, I missed you kids.

118
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:33,323
Should I put my coat in the bedroom?

119
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:36,350
No, I'll take that for you.

120
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,233
Well, thank you.

121
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,363
Such a gentleman. Thank you.

122
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,894
It all looks so nice.

123
00:05:45,894 --> 00:05:48,345
So festive. All the balloons.

124
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,962
Oh, the funniest thing happened

125
00:05:49,962 --> 00:05:51,543
to me on the way here.

126
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,365
I was driving--

127
00:05:53,365 --> 00:05:54,445
That's great!

128
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,872
I can't wait to hear it,

129
00:05:59,872 --> 00:06:02,187
but I have to go to the bathroom.

130
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,290
Hey, come with me.

131
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,285
What?

132
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,310
Like we're gal pals. Like at

133
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,290
a restaurant. It'll be fun! Come on.

134
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,772
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

135
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:18,336
Think. Think.

136
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,312
What would Jack and Chrissy do?

137
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,348
Okay, now that your coat

138
00:06:24,348 --> 00:06:26,248
is safely in the bed--

139
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:27,398
We can come back

140
00:06:27,398 --> 00:06:28,444
to the living room.

141
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,270
Joey and Chandler, it's time

142
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,318
you take Dr. Greene over to your place.

143
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,361
Yes, absolutely.

144
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,420
Why, again?

145
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:41,261
Because that's where

146
00:06:41,261 --> 00:06:43,257
the party is, you goon!

147
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,332
This is the staging area.

148
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:47,328
Right, it's the staging area.

149
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:48,920
This is clearly

150
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,467
in the wrong apartment.

151
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,831
All right, you guys are off

152
00:06:57,831 --> 00:07:00,214
to party number one.

153
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,217
And you....

154
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,290
You are off to party number two.

155
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:07,303
Let's keep it moving,

156
00:07:07,303 --> 00:07:09,282
let's keep it moving.

157
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,846
Could you at least send

158
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:14,495
some women to my party?

159
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:18,336
Okay, that's Ross. All right.

160
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,235
Okay, they're coming.

161
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,406
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.

162
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,250
Thanks for being born.

163
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,815
Thank you for my beautiful earrings.

164
00:07:34,815 --> 00:07:37,312
They're perfect. I love you.

165
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,374
Now, you can exchange them

166
00:07:39,374 --> 00:07:41,325
if you want, okay?

167
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,329
Now I love you even more.

168
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,429
Surprise!

169
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,338
Oh, my gosh! Wow! Monica!

170
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,953
Oh, my God. Mom!

171
00:07:55,953 --> 00:07:57,466
This is so great!

172
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,303
Happy birthday, sweetie.

173
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,281
You! I had no idea!

174
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:05,281
Really?

175
00:08:05,281 --> 00:08:06,179
No, I knew.

176
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,219
All right.

177
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,380
There's food and drinks on the table.

178
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,287
Go across the hall.

179
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,384
Now, Joey and Chandler's.

180
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:14,807
Why?

181
00:08:14,807 --> 00:08:15,421
Just go.

182
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:18,385
Weird.

183
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,296
Surprise!

184
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,395
Happy birthday, sweet pea.

185
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,433
Daddy!

186
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,744
Both of them are here?

187
00:08:36,744 --> 00:08:38,240
Both of them are here?

188
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,330
Well, we could count again?

189
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,343
I can't believe this.

190
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,417
This is ridiculous.

191
00:08:44,417 --> 00:08:46,413
This is your birthday, your party.

192
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:48,739
Put them together.

193
00:08:48,739 --> 00:08:50,252
If they can't deal with it, who cares?

194
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,825
I do.

195
00:08:51,825 --> 00:08:53,321
That's who.

196
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,425
Will you be okay?

197
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:57,833
I don't really have a choice.

198
00:08:57,833 --> 00:08:59,431
I can look at the bright side.

199
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,303
I get two birthday parties

200
00:09:01,303 --> 00:09:02,400
and two cakes.

201
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,257
Well, actually,

202
00:09:05,257 --> 00:09:07,305
just one birthday flan.

203
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:10,170
What?

204
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,700
It's a traditional

205
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,184
Mexican custard dessert.

206
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,198
Talk to Monica.

207
00:09:15,198 --> 00:09:17,177
She's on the food committee.

208
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,279
A girl walked up to me

209
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:27,749
and said, ''I want you, Dennis'' and stuck her tongue

211
00:09:27,749 --> 00:09:29,199
down my throat.

212
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,226
I love this party!

213
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,350
Volleyball question.

214
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,396
Volleyball.

215
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,197
We set up a court in your room.

216
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,823
You didn't like

217
00:09:37,823 --> 00:09:39,404
that gray lamp, did you?

218
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:41,845
A woman stuck her tongue down

219
00:09:41,845 --> 00:09:44,245
my throat. I'm not even listening.

220
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,285
Dennis!

221
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,253
Okay, that's me.

222
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,389
Can you keep Dad occupied?

223
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,357
I'm gonna talk to Mom for a while.

224
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,875
Do you have any ideas

225
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,325
for any openers?

226
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,395
Stay clear of ''I'm the guy

227
00:09:57,395 --> 00:10:02,333
doing your daughter'' and you should be okay.

229
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,427
Take a piece of paper.

230
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:07,871
Here you go. And write down

231
00:10:07,871 --> 00:10:10,271
your most embarrassing memory.

232
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,408
When you're not using the markers,

233
00:10:12,408 --> 00:10:17,374
put the caps back on them because they will dry out.

235
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,241
Hi, Dr. Greene.

236
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:27,384
So how's everything in the vascular surgery game?

238
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:30,428
It's not a game, Ross.

239
00:10:30,428 --> 00:10:32,362
A woman died on my table today.

240
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,262
I'm sorry.

241
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,395
That's the good thing about my job.

242
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,484
All the dinosaurs on my table

243
00:10:40,484 --> 00:10:42,497
are already dead.

244
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,860
I don't mean

245
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,893
to be a pain about this but I've seen some of you

247
00:10:48,893 --> 00:10:50,406
just place them on.

248
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:56,411
You want to push the caps until you hear them click.

250
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,325
Gunther! Where you going?

251
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,260
I was sort of thinking about maybe--

252
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,842
No! No, you can't go!

253
00:11:04,842 --> 00:11:06,355
No, this is fun.

254
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,400
We're just getting started.

255
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,368
Here's your marker.

256
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,362
If you want to go, just go.

257
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:18,239
No, she'll yell at me again.

258
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,458
All right, I can get you out.

259
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,437
What?

260
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,284
In a minute, I'll create a diversion.

261
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,367
When I do, walk quickly to the door

262
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:32,380
and don't look back.

263
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,755
I think I need a drink.

264
00:11:34,755 --> 00:11:36,251
I'll get it for you.

265
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,329
What do you want?

266
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:38,296
Scotch.

267
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:40,445
I'll be back in 10 seconds with

268
00:11:40,445 --> 00:11:42,493
your scotch on the rocks in a glass.

269
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,816
Neat!

270
00:11:44,816 --> 00:11:46,363
Cool.

271
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:49,407
Neat, as in no rocks.

272
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,310
I know.

273
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,349
Hello, Ross!

274
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,317
Where have you been?

275
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:03,219
I have been in the bathroom.

276
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:07,224
Stay clear of the salmon mousse.

277
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,253
Scotch neat.

278
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:16,267
That's Rachel's father's drink.

279
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,361
Mine too. Isn't that neat?

280
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,463
Scotch neat.

281
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,473
Would you excuse me?

282
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:35,250
Where are you sneaking off to, mister?

283
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:37,004
I'm getting my cigarettes.

284
00:12:37,004 --> 00:12:38,454
No.

285
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,925
What do you mean no?

286
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:43,359
See, because that's the staging area.

287
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:45,477
You go in there, it'll ruin

288
00:12:45,477 --> 00:12:47,559
the whole illusion of the party.

289
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,949
Take your scotch back in there and I will get

291
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:53,496
your cigarettes for you, sir.

292
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,321
Get my glasses too.

293
00:12:56,321 --> 00:12:58,369
All righty-roo.

294
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,280
What a great moment to say that

295
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,214
for the first time.

296
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,301
Okay, the first person's

297
00:13:09,301 --> 00:13:11,349
most embarrassing memory is:

298
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,324
''Monica, your party sucks.''

299
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,421
Very funny.

300
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:18,742
Oh, no! Did someone forget

301
00:13:18,742 --> 00:13:20,255
to use a coaster?

302
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,266
What?

303
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,465
I don't see anything.

304
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,371
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.

305
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,474
Ross, whose glasses are those?

306
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,243
Mine.

307
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,388
You wear bifocals?

308
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:49,327
I have a condition apparently

309
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:55,460
that I require...two different sets of focals.

311
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:57,949
Do you know my husband

312
00:13:57,949 --> 00:13:59,496
has glasses just like that?

313
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,434
Well, those are very popular frames.

314
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,302
Neil Sedaka wears them.

315
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,341
I hear you can get people out of here.

316
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,967
You didn't tell me

317
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:17,514
your boyfriend smokes.

318
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,226
Yeah, like a chimney.

319
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,318
Big smoker.

320
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,458
Big, big smoker.

321
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,831
I'm gonna go out into the hallway

322
00:14:28,831 --> 00:14:31,430
and fire up this bad boy.

323
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:46,383
Are you wearing my glasses?

324
00:14:46,383 --> 00:14:49,284
Yes.

325
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,823
I was just warming up

326
00:14:52,823 --> 00:14:55,257
the earpieces for you.

327
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,352
Thank you.

328
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,489
Is that one of my cigarettes?

329
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,774
Yes, it is. I was just

330
00:15:09,774 --> 00:15:12,242
moistening the tip.

331
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,825
She's taking the trash out,

332
00:15:14,825 --> 00:15:16,338
so I can get you out.

333
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,865
But it has to be now.

334
00:15:17,865 --> 00:15:19,315
She'll be back soon.

335
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,340
And my friend?

336
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,336
Only you three.

337
00:15:22,336 --> 00:15:24,253
Any more and she'll get suspicious.

338
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,335
Let me just get my coat.

339
00:15:26,335 --> 00:15:28,314
There isn't time!

340
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,795
Just leave everything.

341
00:15:31,795 --> 00:15:34,229
They'll take care of you next door.

342
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,325
Is it true they have beer?

343
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:40,271
Everything you've heard is true.

344
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,237
Could you guys please keep it down?

345
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,805
We're trying to start

346
00:15:44,805 --> 00:15:46,335
a Boggle tournament.

347
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:47,925
If people find out

348
00:15:47,925 --> 00:15:52,274
they're playing spelling games there'll be nobody left here.

350
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:57,870
You!

351
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,252
And you.

352
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,788
You're supposed to be at my party.

353
00:16:01,788 --> 00:16:04,285
And Gunther!

354
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,425
What are you doing here?

355
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,331
Welcome to the f--

356
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:20,774
I'm sorry.

357
00:16:20,774 --> 00:16:22,304
But these people needed me.

358
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:25,283
They work hard all week. It's Saturday.

359
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:28,218
They deserve to have fun. Go!

360
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,771
You know, my party is fun. It's

361
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:33,222
a quieter, less obvious sort of fun.

362
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:34,839
But if people would just

363
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:36,420
give it a chance, it's--

364
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,849
You want me to see a therapist?

365
00:16:42,849 --> 00:16:45,266
Sweetheart, you have a problem.

366
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,288
You've chosen a boyfriend

367
00:16:47,288 --> 00:16:49,239
exactly like your father.

368
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,339
Okay, Mom, I'll make an appointment.

369
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:53,908
But right now, I gotta go.

370
00:16:53,908 --> 00:16:55,438
I gotta go do a thing.

371
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:58,363
Did you know your mother

372
00:16:58,363 --> 00:17:01,179
spent $1 200 on bonsai trees?

373
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,300
I felt like Gulliver

374
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,380
around that place.

375
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,204
Daddy, I want to hear more about this,

376
00:17:07,204 --> 00:17:10,219
but I just have to do some stuff.

377
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:11,791
You work and work

378
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,798
and work at a marriage but all he cares about

380
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:16,197
is his boat.

381
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:17,735
You work and work

382
00:17:17,735 --> 00:17:19,202
and work on a boat.

383
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:22,240
He always ridiculed my pottery classes.

384
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,309
And you sand it and varnish it.

385
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,327
But when all's said and done,

386
00:17:26,327 --> 00:17:28,244
he drinks out of the mugs.

387
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,843
A night of her yoga

388
00:17:29,843 --> 00:17:31,339
and Bridges of Madison County....

389
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:32,867
-Scotch, cigarettes....

390
00:17:32,867 --> 00:17:34,317
-The bonsais, Chihuahua....

391
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,853
I've been in therapy

392
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:37,286
for three weeks but--

393
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:38,840
What the hell does she want

394
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,324
with half a boat?

395
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,442
Okay, okay, you can be shirts

396
00:17:45,442 --> 00:17:47,455
and I'll be skins.

397
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,225
I'll be skins!

398
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,377
How you holding up there, tiger?

399
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,796
Sorry. When my parents got divorced,

400
00:18:02,796 --> 00:18:05,213
I got a lot of ''tigers.''

401
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,848
I got a lot of ''champs,''

402
00:18:06,848 --> 00:18:08,412
''chiefs,'' ''sports.''

403
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,382
I even got a ''governor.''

404
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,308
This is it, isn't it?

405
00:18:14,308 --> 00:18:16,225
This is what my life will be like.

406
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:18,863
My mom there, my dad there.

407
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:21,331
Thanksgiving, Christmas.

408
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,301
She gets the house, he's in a condo

409
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:27,202
my sister will decorate with wicker.

410
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:29,257
Chandler, how did you

411
00:18:29,257 --> 00:18:31,208
get through this?

412
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:33,874
I relied on a carefully

413
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:40,241
regimented program of denial and wetting the bed.

415
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,886
You know, I just--

416
00:18:42,886 --> 00:18:44,319
It's so weird.

417
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:46,790
I mean, I was in there just listening

418
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,224
to them bitch about each other.

419
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:51,341
All I kept thinking about

420
00:18:51,341 --> 00:18:53,354
was the Fourth of July.

421
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,900
It reminded you of the way our

422
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,368
forefathers bitched at each other?

423
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:00,738
It's just this thing.

424
00:19:00,738 --> 00:19:03,741
Every year we would go on my dad's boat

426
00:19:03,741 --> 00:19:05,208
and watch fireworks.

427
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,340
Mom always hated it because

428
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,370
the ocean air made her hair all big.

429
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,346
My sister Jill would be

430
00:19:11,346 --> 00:19:14,781
throwing up over the side and Dad would be upset

432
00:19:14,781 --> 00:19:16,277
because nobody helped.

433
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,788
And when we helped, he'd scream

434
00:19:18,788 --> 00:19:21,188
at us for doing it wrong.

435
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:24,811
But then when the fireworks started,

436
00:19:24,811 --> 00:19:27,228
everybody just shut up.

437
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,392
You know, and it'd get really cold.

438
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,418
And we'd all just sort of smoosh

439
00:19:31,418 --> 00:19:33,335
under this one blanket.

440
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,401
It never occurred to anybody

441
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:37,397
to bring another one.

442
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,311
And now it's....

443
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:46,315
Yeah, I know.

444
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,386
Thanks for coming.

445
00:20:09,386 --> 00:20:10,432
Hope you had fun.

446
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,392
All right, I'm hitting the road.

447
00:20:13,392 --> 00:20:16,242
I've left my 10 verbs on the table.

448
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,361
Be sure and send me

449
00:20:17,361 --> 00:20:18,441
that finished poem.

450
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,474
Okay, will do. Glad you came.

451
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,249
I think I saw Rachel out in the hall?

452
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:25,245
Let me check.

453
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,874
Your mom wants to say goodbye.

454
00:20:28,874 --> 00:20:31,257
Happy birthday, sweetie.

455
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,290
You drive safe.

456
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,366
What are you doing?

457
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,404
I'm getting ready

458
00:20:41,404 --> 00:20:43,304
for the water-skiing.

459
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,326
Okay, big hug. One more.

460
00:20:45,326 --> 00:20:47,277
Come on, big hug!

461
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,505
How are you?

462
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:53,296
Where are you going?

463
00:20:53,296 --> 00:20:54,308
For my coat.

464
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,284
We'll get it for you.

465
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,901
All right, all right.

466
00:20:57,901 --> 00:20:59,414
I can get my own coat.

467
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,332
Sorry, we're on a major flan high.

468
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,386
Oh, no. No, you're not

469
00:21:13,386 --> 00:21:14,535
supposed to be here.

470
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,270
This is the staging area.

471
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,266
It's wrong. You should leave.

472
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:22,438
You know, just get out.

473
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:32,306
Or perhaps you'd like

474
00:21:32,306 --> 00:21:34,257
a crème de menthe.

475
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,384
I have to head to my chateau.

476
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,928
I guess we're going

477
00:21:37,928 --> 00:21:39,395
into the hallway again.

478
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,399
Thanks for coming, Mrs. Greene.

479
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,279
Okay.

480
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:57,280
You take care.

481
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:02,216
Oh, you kids.

482
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:05,450
Well.

483
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,393
This is the best party

484
00:22:08,393 --> 00:22:10,361
I've been to in years.

485
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,363
Thank you!

486
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,461
Okay, everybody, time for flan!

487
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,268
Yep! Get ready

488
00:22:22,268 --> 00:22:24,264
for the gelatinous fun.

489
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:25,957
Looks like what you get

490
00:22:25,957 --> 00:22:27,538
when you get an infection.

491
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,474
Okay, that's enough.

492
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,846
Okay, Rachel,

493
00:22:31,846 --> 00:22:33,444
make a special flan wish.

494
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,379
Okay, I've got one.

495
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,249
Heads up!

496
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,325
Wow! Those things almost

497
00:22:45,325 --> 00:22:47,355
never come true.
