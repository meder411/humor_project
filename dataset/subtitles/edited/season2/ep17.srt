1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But he had the game on, so we started watching.

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
At halftime, I was gonna give him what for.

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He's got it on tap!

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In his apartment. The thing is built into his bar. It's unbelievable!

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Dad, did you talk about me?

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, right. Well, actually, we never got to you.

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Look, you're a big girl. I just hope you know what you're doing.

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I do.

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
So where did you get the hat?

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I don't know.

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You're wearing the tie I got you!

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah.

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But he offered me a beer. Know what?

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What?

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
And?

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was gonna punch him in the nose.

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey, Dad. What are you doing here?

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I just stopped by your boyfriend's.

19
00:00:06,395 --> 00:00:10,422
So, what do you think? Casa de Joey.

20
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,412
I decorated it myself.

21
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:13,424
Get out!

22
00:00:15,338 --> 00:00:17,397
Wow, Joey, this is....

23
00:00:18,207 --> 00:00:19,703
Art.

24
00:00:19,703 --> 00:00:21,199
Art it is.

25
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,243
Check this out. Is it a coffee table?

26
00:00:24,347 --> 00:00:27,407
Is it a panther? There's no need to decide.

27
00:00:28,417 --> 00:00:31,409
Hey, nice pillow.

28
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:35,418
So now tell me, is this genuine Muppet skin?

29
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:39,224
Hey, excellent water table thing.

30
00:00:39,328 --> 00:00:44,322
Thanks. I love this. But you know what? It makes me want to pee.

31
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:47,368
Yeah, me too. I think that's the challenge.

32
00:00:49,338 --> 00:00:52,273
How come Chandler didn't come?

33
00:00:54,276 --> 00:00:57,439
It's because he had a thing with the thing.

34
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:01,374
Right. I got it.

35
00:01:03,285 --> 00:01:06,379
So why don't you show us the rest of your casa?

36
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:10,188
The best part! Come on.

37
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,325
Nice toilet.

38
00:01:20,403 --> 00:01:22,303
No. Behind it.

39
00:01:22,338 --> 00:01:24,334
You have a phone in here?

40
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:28,410
That's right. I have a phone in here.

42
00:01:29,412 --> 00:01:30,407
Promise me something.

43
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:31,402
Yeah?

44
00:01:31,447 --> 00:01:34,314
Never call me from that phone.

45
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:32,398
Okay, here we go.

46
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:38,212
Sorry, they were all out of apple pie. Someone just got the last piece.

47
00:02:39,248 --> 00:02:41,443
Oh, my God! You won't believe this!

48
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:44,445
I have just been discovered.

49
00:02:46,222 --> 00:02:51,216
Now wait a minute. I claimed you in the name of France four years ago.

50
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:54,418
Anyway.

51
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:59,433
Don't freak out and say how great this is until I'm done.

52
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:10,174
I met this producer of this record company who said I have a fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of ''Smelly Cat.''

55
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:14,206
I told you not to do that yet.

56
00:03:16,185 --> 00:03:18,278
And she wants to do a video.

57
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:22,214
I'm not done yet, okay?

58
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:24,188
God!

59
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:29,186
If that goes well, they may even want to make an album.

60
00:03:32,234 --> 00:03:34,202
I'm done now.

61
00:03:36,405 --> 00:03:40,307
If you care for me, get the pie out of the man's hood.

62
00:03:40,342 --> 00:03:41,889
Get the what?

63
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,436
There's a pie in the hood. Go!

64
00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:52,387
What are you doing?

65
00:03:52,387 --> 00:03:54,355
I'm sorry. My pie was in your hood.

66
00:03:57,326 --> 00:04:04,198
I have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7.

68
00:04:08,304 --> 00:04:12,263
Damn it, Ross! Get your butt out of the bathroom!

69
00:04:12,374 --> 00:04:15,309
Calm down. I'm blow-drying.

70
00:04:15,411 --> 00:04:19,177
Blow-drying what? You have no hair.

71
00:04:20,216 --> 00:04:21,814
What's going on?

72
00:04:21,814 --> 00:04:23,412
He's been in there for an hour.

73
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,188
It's like I live with him again.

74
00:04:26,288 --> 00:04:30,224
He's here when I sleep, wake up and when I want to shower.

75
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:32,192
It's like I'm 1 6 again.

76
00:04:32,294 --> 00:04:35,229
Well, you're not 1 6. You're both adults now.

77
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:37,296
Get out, you doofus!

78
00:04:40,236 --> 00:04:43,228
Or, you know, he's rubber and you're glue.

79
00:04:46,342 --> 00:04:48,207
All yours.

80
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:52,237
I hope you cleaned your hair out of the drain.

81
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,279
Shut up!

82
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:56,308
Shut up.

83
00:04:57,319 --> 00:04:58,513
Cut it out!

84
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,354
I've never wanted you more.

85
00:05:38,394 --> 00:05:40,191
Hello?

86
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:42,361
Louie? Where's Howard?

87
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:44,426
He went home.

88
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:47,293
He said he might stop up.

89
00:05:47,336 --> 00:05:51,295
He said to tell you he wasn't feeling so good.

90
00:05:51,407 --> 00:05:54,205
Hey, what time do you get off?

91
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,440
I'm not feeling too good either.

92
00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:07,446
So, what do you say, boys? Should I call him?

93
00:06:14,196 --> 00:06:21,395
You know what they say: Ask your slippers a question you're going crazy.

95
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:33,281
Freaking art!

96
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,400
Hello.

97
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,384
Hey.

98
00:06:37,186 --> 00:06:38,175
Hey!

99
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,381
Sorry I didn't make it over there.

100
00:06:40,422 --> 00:06:42,413
That's okay.

101
00:06:43,225 --> 00:06:45,216
You had a thing.

102
00:06:45,394 --> 00:06:48,392
I hear the place looks great.

103
00:06:48,392 --> 00:06:51,390
Forget about it. I'm having a ball!

104
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:53,316
How's the apartment doing?

105
00:06:53,316 --> 00:06:55,199
It's terrific.

106
00:06:55,237 --> 00:06:59,501
I mean, it's a regular space fest!

108
00:07:01,343 --> 00:07:03,174
Well, great.

109
00:07:03,278 --> 00:07:07,237
Yeah, I just wanted to call and say hey.

110
00:07:09,151 --> 00:07:10,140
Well, okay.

111
00:07:11,253 --> 00:07:12,817
Was that the oven timer?

112
00:07:12,817 --> 00:07:14,381
That's right, my friend.

113
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,191
-It's time for....
-Baywatch!

114
00:07:22,264 --> 00:07:24,778
You believe Stephanie has skin cancer?

115
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,292
I can't believe she's lieutenant!

116
00:07:29,204 --> 00:07:31,365
That's because you love Yasmine Bleeth.

117
00:07:32,174 --> 00:07:35,166
How could anyone not love Yasmine Bleeth?

118
00:07:37,179 --> 00:07:38,271
They're running!

119
00:07:39,381 --> 00:07:42,373
See, this is the brilliance of the show.

120
00:07:43,185 --> 00:07:45,415
I say always keep them running.

121
00:07:46,321 --> 00:07:48,186
All the time running!

122
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,221
Run!

123
00:07:51,193 --> 00:07:52,182
Run!

124
00:07:52,294 --> 00:07:55,229
Run, Yasmine! Run like the wind!

125
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,264
But you wanted to live by yourself.

126
00:07:59,264 --> 00:08:01,329
I did. I thought it'd be great.

127
00:08:01,437 --> 00:08:05,168
I figured I'd have time alone with my thoughts.

128
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,142
It turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.

129
00:08:10,245 --> 00:08:13,237
Why don't you talk to Chandler and move back?

130
00:08:13,282 --> 00:08:19,921
You really think he'd take me? We had a good talk last night but when I moved, I hurt him bad.

132
00:08:19,921 --> 00:08:22,389
He would definitely want you back.

133
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:26,150
I'm telling you, no way he's moving back.

134
00:08:26,261 --> 00:08:30,254
But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night.

135
00:08:30,365 --> 00:08:32,162
I mean, it was--

136
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:35,170
It was like when we first lived together.

137
00:08:35,304 --> 00:08:43,267
I know you don't want to hear this now but we've seen him in his new place. And he's happy.

139
00:08:43,378 --> 00:08:45,403
He's decorated.

140
00:08:46,381 --> 00:08:50,374
Chandler, he has moved on, okay? You have to, too.

141
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:54,378
You have to accept the fact that you're just friends now.

142
00:08:54,456 --> 00:08:59,285
You're not roommates anymore.

144
00:09:00,162 --> 00:09:02,153
Okay, you ready to try one?

145
00:09:02,331 --> 00:09:03,389
Okay.

146
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:09,135
Smelly cat, smelly cat

147
00:09:09,238 --> 00:09:11,365
What are they feeding you?

148
00:09:12,274 --> 00:09:15,334
Smelly, smelly Really bad smelling smelly cat

149
00:09:16,144 --> 00:09:18,169
Whoa! Oh, my God!

150
00:09:20,282 --> 00:09:23,251
I mean, like, who was that?

151
00:09:24,286 --> 00:09:28,279
They're your backup singers. Behind you, hon.

152
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,260
I thought they were just watching me.

153
00:09:32,294 --> 00:09:35,195
Like at an aquarium, you know?

154
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:37,231
They're so good. You're so good!

155
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:39,165
Alrighty!

156
00:09:39,268 --> 00:09:44,171
Okay, now that everyone knows everyone, let's try it again.

157
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:45,195
From the top.

158
00:09:45,274 --> 00:09:48,300
Smelly cat, smelly cat

159
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:51,379
What are they feeding you?

160
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,378
Smelly, smelly, smelly, really bad Smelling smelly cat. It's not your--

161
00:09:57,185 --> 00:10:05,387
Okay, sorry. I'm just not getting that everyone gets how smelly this cat actually is.

163
00:10:06,228 --> 00:10:11,393
If we could talk about this. I need to feel that you care about the cat.

164
00:10:14,236 --> 00:10:18,229
We can talk, but this costs $100 a minute to be in here.

165
00:10:18,307 --> 00:10:22,403
Okay, so the cat stinks, but you love it. Let's go.

166
00:10:23,245 --> 00:10:26,408
No, there is no way he was a velociraptor.

167
00:10:26,515 --> 00:10:28,449
Look at the cranial ridge.

168
00:10:29,217 --> 00:10:33,347
If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones.

169
00:10:35,324 --> 00:10:36,837
Were you taking a nap?

170
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:38,350
I was.

171
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,361
Can you hold on? That's the other line.

172
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,454
Hello?

173
00:10:43,231 --> 00:10:46,223
Yeah, she's here, but can she call you back?

174
00:10:46,335 --> 00:10:47,427
Okay, thanks.

175
00:10:48,236 --> 00:10:49,282
Call Joanna.

176
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,328
She leave a number?

177
00:10:50,372 --> 00:10:53,273
Did you see me write one down?

178
00:10:54,343 --> 00:10:57,335
I don't have her number, butt-munch.

179
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,331
She'll call back. Don't be a baby.

180
00:11:00,331 --> 00:11:02,282
You're the baby.

181
00:11:02,317 --> 00:11:03,346
Off my back.

182
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:04,375
Get out of my face.

183
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,379
Wait, hold on, Tony. Hold on.

184
00:11:08,223 --> 00:11:09,315
Hello?

185
00:11:09,491 --> 00:11:11,220
Hi.

186
00:11:11,326 --> 00:11:14,193
Yeah, No. she's right here. Hold on.

187
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,189
Tony, can I call you back? That's my sister's boyfriend.

188
00:11:19,301 --> 00:11:20,768
Give me that.

189
00:11:20,768 --> 00:11:22,235
Okay.

190
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:28,336
Sweetie, before I forget, did I leave my diaphragm at your place?

191
00:11:30,245 --> 00:11:32,213
Hi, Mom.

192
00:11:53,368 --> 00:11:56,360
So how's the palace?

193
00:11:56,438 --> 00:12:00,306
Funny you should mention that, because I was thinking--

194
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:02,400
What's with the boxes?

195
00:12:04,312 --> 00:12:06,405
Actually, I have some news.

196
00:12:07,182 --> 00:12:10,413
Is Joey gonna pick up his moose hat or should I toss it?

197
00:12:11,386 --> 00:12:15,413
Why don't you ask him yourself? This is my roommate, Eddie.

198
00:12:16,191 --> 00:12:17,704
Nice to meet you.

199
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:19,217
Likewise.

200
00:12:19,394 --> 00:12:24,331
I'll take that. It's what I came for.

201
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,425
So this is new. Where did you two meet?

202
00:12:28,203 --> 00:12:31,400
At the supermarket in the ethnic food section.

203
00:12:32,207 --> 00:12:34,505
I helped him pick a chorizo.

204
00:12:36,344 --> 00:12:40,405
We got to talking. He needed a place and I had a spare room.

205
00:12:40,449 --> 00:12:43,316
Oh, now it's a spare room?

206
00:12:43,418 --> 00:12:48,446
Well, yeah. In that it's not being used and I have it to spare.

208
00:12:50,425 --> 00:12:53,417
Well, I got what I came for.

209
00:12:56,264 --> 00:12:58,255
I'll see you guys.

210
00:13:00,202 --> 00:13:01,362
Hey, Joe.

211
00:13:01,403 --> 00:13:04,270
When'd you start using moose in your hair?

212
00:13:06,374 --> 00:13:09,207
Is this guy great or what?

213
00:13:09,277 --> 00:13:12,178
Yeah, yeah, he is.

214
00:13:18,286 --> 00:13:20,334
He has a new roommate? Who is he?

215
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:22,382
Eddie. He just met him.

216
00:13:22,491 --> 00:13:27,190
It'll never last. He's just a rebound roommate.

217
00:13:30,298 --> 00:13:32,289
Check it out! Check it out!

218
00:13:32,334 --> 00:13:35,326
It's ''Smelly Cat,'' the video!

219
00:13:36,404 --> 00:13:45,243
Now, I haven't seen it yet, so if you don't like it so what? None of you ever made a video.

221
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,313
Get out of here, cat! You stink!

222
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:05,228
Smoking!

223
00:14:05,228 --> 00:14:06,257
Look at me!

224
00:14:06,368 --> 00:14:09,269
Smelly cat, smelly cat

225
00:14:10,205 --> 00:14:13,174
What are they feeding you?

226
00:14:13,275 --> 00:14:16,403
Smelly cat, smelly cat

227
00:14:17,212 --> 00:14:20,409
It's not your fault

228
00:14:24,186 --> 00:14:28,384
Smelly, smelly, really bad smelling Smelly cat, it's not your fault

229
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:31,284
Smelly cat, smelly cat

230
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:32,355
Oh, my God!

231
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:33,384
I know.

232
00:14:33,428 --> 00:14:35,419
I sound amazing!

233
00:14:39,301 --> 00:14:44,238
They won't take you to the vet You're obviously not their favorite pet

234
00:14:44,306 --> 00:14:46,433
Smelly cat, smelly cat

235
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:50,201
It's not your fault

236
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:52,202
Oh, no

237
00:14:52,314 --> 00:14:57,411
I've never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my own head.

238
00:14:57,452 --> 00:15:01,354
This is so cool! Now I can hear what you hear!

239
00:15:02,257 --> 00:15:04,248
Pretty different, huh?

240
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,296
I am sorry, but I'm incredibly talented!

241
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:12,393
Smelly cat, smelly cat

242
00:15:13,168 --> 00:15:15,363
It's not your fault

243
00:15:26,281 --> 00:15:27,731
Joey, what's going on, man?

244
00:15:27,731 --> 00:15:29,181
Eddie.

245
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:30,799
Morning.

246
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,181
Morning.

247
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,383
I just came by to pick up my mail.

248
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,388
Where's the mail?

249
00:15:37,388 --> 00:15:38,485
Over on the table.

250
00:15:39,394 --> 00:15:41,385
It's not on this table anymore?

251
00:15:41,496 --> 00:15:44,397
No. Eddie likes to keep it over there.

252
00:15:47,402 --> 00:15:51,304
All right, here you go, my friend. Eggs à Ia Eddie.

253
00:15:56,344 --> 00:15:58,403
That's great.

254
00:16:00,348 --> 00:16:01,337
What?

255
00:16:01,383 --> 00:16:07,253
I thought you liked eggs with bread with the hole in the middle à Ia me!

256
00:16:07,355 --> 00:16:11,257
I do, but Eddie makes them this way. They're darn good.

257
00:16:11,393 --> 00:16:12,388
Wanna try some?

258
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,383
No, thanks.

259
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:18,394
All right. Well, you guys, I'm out of here.

260
00:16:19,301 --> 00:16:20,347
See you, pals.

261
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:21,393
See you.

262
00:16:24,372 --> 00:16:26,340
How are you two getting along?

263
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,308
I couldn't be happier.

264
00:16:28,376 --> 00:16:32,278
Great. I'm happy for you.

265
00:16:35,216 --> 00:16:37,275
All right, that's it!

266
00:16:37,385 --> 00:16:42,288
He just comes in here, Mr. Johnny New Eggs, with his--

267
00:16:43,325 --> 00:16:48,194
His moving the mail and his, ''See you, pals.''

268
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:51,322
There's no juice!

269
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:57,201
There's no juice for the people who need the juice. I need the juice!

270
00:16:57,238 --> 00:17:00,173
There's another carton right over there.

271
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,344
This isn't about juice anymore, all right?

272
00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:05,709
All right. What's it about?

273
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:07,239
Eggs!

274
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,285
Whose eggs do you like better, his or mine?

275
00:17:11,353 --> 00:17:12,786
I like both eggs equally!

276
00:17:12,786 --> 00:17:14,219
Come on!

277
00:17:14,389 --> 00:17:19,156
Nobody likes two eggs equally! Which one do you like better?

278
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,287
What's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore!

279
00:17:23,365 --> 00:17:26,232
You took your eggs and you left!

280
00:17:26,301 --> 00:17:30,203
Did you expect me to never find new eggs?

281
00:17:30,305 --> 00:17:32,466
Maybe this isn't about the eggs.

282
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:37,167
Maybe this is about the chicken that laid them.

283
00:17:39,381 --> 00:17:42,248
What chicken? There's no chicken.

284
00:17:42,317 --> 00:17:44,376
I can't talk to you!

285
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,857
I want Entertainment Tonight.

286
00:17:49,857 --> 00:17:54,259
We're watching Predators of the Serengeti.

288
00:17:54,329 --> 00:17:55,876
Would you guys stop?!

289
00:17:55,876 --> 00:17:57,423
It's my TV!

290
00:17:58,233 --> 00:17:58,727
Quit it!

291
00:17:58,727 --> 00:17:59,221
Bite me!

292
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:00,232
Oh, my God!

293
00:18:00,335 --> 00:18:03,236
Monica keeps changing the channel.

294
00:18:03,271 --> 00:18:06,206
Great. Why don't you tell Mommy on me?

295
00:18:06,341 --> 00:18:09,333
Now I'm Mommy in this little play?

296
00:18:09,377 --> 00:18:15,247
Look, I refuse to get sucked into this weird little Geller dimension thing!

297
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:21,355
I'm gonna take a nice long, hot bubble bath because you kids are driving me crazy!

299
00:18:24,292 --> 00:18:26,243
What do we do about this?

300
00:18:26,243 --> 00:18:28,194
Tape Entertainment Tonight.

301
00:18:28,296 --> 00:18:31,265
Not that! This! Us!

302
00:18:31,366 --> 00:18:34,199
Oh, my God, Ross.... You're just....

303
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:37,170
Since you've been here, you drive....

304
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:40,265
Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, all right?

305
00:18:40,475 --> 00:18:45,201
I just can't stand you being here all the time!

307
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,183
Why? Why can't you stand me being here? We're just having fun.

308
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:52,412
Fun? You think this is fun?

309
00:18:54,222 --> 00:18:57,385
We were fooling around, like when we were kids.

310
00:18:58,193 --> 00:19:01,162
I hated you when we were kids!

311
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,143
You hated me when we were kids?

312
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:11,228
I hated you. I loved you in a you're-my-brother-so-I-have-to way, but basically I hated your guts.

314
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:13,739
Why did you hate me?

315
00:19:13,739 --> 00:19:20,374
Because you were mean to me and you teased me and you always got your way.

317
00:19:21,249 --> 00:19:24,150
And that wasn't fun for you?

318
00:19:27,188 --> 00:19:29,179
I can't believe you hated me.

319
00:19:30,358 --> 00:19:33,293
But now I love you.

320
00:19:35,163 --> 00:19:36,710
And not just because I have to.

321
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,257
Really?

322
00:19:38,366 --> 00:19:40,163
Yeah.

323
00:19:41,202 --> 00:19:44,365
You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.

324
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:50,309
I can do that.

325
00:19:50,378 --> 00:19:53,211
Then I won't have to kill you.

326
00:19:56,184 --> 00:19:59,312
So you wanna watch Entertainment Tonight?

327
00:19:59,387 --> 00:20:01,184
Thanks.

328
00:20:01,222 --> 00:20:04,214
Tonight, America's sport's magazine moves to--

329
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:05,355
You know what?

330
00:20:05,355 --> 00:20:06,418
What?

331
00:20:07,195 --> 00:20:11,188
If you really wanna watch that Serengeti thing, we can.

332
00:20:11,232 --> 00:20:12,324
Okay.

333
00:20:20,408 --> 00:20:26,344
Listen, you are not going to believe this but that is not me singing on the video.

335
00:20:31,219 --> 00:20:32,345
How did you find out?

336
00:20:32,453 --> 00:20:41,227
The record company sent a paper for me to sign saying it's okay for someone else to sing for me. That was a clue.

338
00:20:41,462 --> 00:20:43,225
What will you do?

339
00:20:43,331 --> 00:20:45,299
I can't work with people who do this.

340
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:47,267
Sure.

341
00:20:47,335 --> 00:20:49,286
I mean, this poor woman.

342
00:20:49,286 --> 00:20:51,237
What woman?

343
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:52,328
The voice woman.

344
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,274
She has a great voice, but she doesn't have a video.

345
00:20:56,344 --> 00:20:58,357
Okay, Pheebs, what about you?

346
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,370
I have a video. Pay attention.

347
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:07,211
This voice woman, she's so talented.

348
00:21:07,322 --> 00:21:12,282
But according to the producer people, she doesn't have the right look.

349
00:21:12,393 --> 00:21:19,496
She's like one of those animals at the pound who nobody wants because they're not pretty enough.

351
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:22,430
Or some old dog who's kind of stinky and--

352
00:21:23,204 --> 00:21:25,399
Oh, my God! She's ''Smelly Cat''!

353
00:21:28,343 --> 00:21:31,403
That song has so many levels.

354
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:34,237
Hey, Eddie.

355
00:21:34,349 --> 00:21:36,340
You wanna play some foosball?

356
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:40,251
No, thanks, man. I'm not really into sports.

357
00:21:45,226 --> 00:21:47,353
Yeah, okay. All right.

358
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:51,455
Doesn't matter. Time for Baywatch!

359
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:55,427
You like that show?

360
00:21:57,272 --> 00:21:59,365
You don't like that show?

361
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:04,177
It's just pretty people running around on the beach.

362
00:22:04,212 --> 00:22:06,373
That's the brilliance of it.

363
00:22:08,383 --> 00:22:10,408
The pretty people.

364
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:13,387
And the running.

365
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:18,316
I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while.

366
00:22:19,327 --> 00:22:21,295
Okay, man.

367
00:23:18,386 --> 00:23:23,221
I'm gonna start off with a little song called ''Smelly Cat.''

368
00:23:23,424 --> 00:23:28,191
Oh, for those of you who are wondering, this is my real voice.

369
00:23:28,329 --> 00:23:31,321
Smelly cat, smelly cat

370
00:23:31,399 --> 00:23:34,391
What are they feeding you? Everybody!

371
00:23:34,435 --> 00:23:37,404
Smelly cat, smelly cat

372
00:23:38,206 --> 00:23:40,231
It's not your fault

373
00:23:40,308 --> 00:23:43,300
-Monica!
-They won't take you to the vet

374
00:23:43,344 --> 00:23:45,312
Chandler!

375
00:23:47,248 --> 00:23:49,443
You're obviously not their favorite pet

376
00:23:50,218 --> 00:23:53,244
-Joey!
-You may not be a bed of roses

377
