1
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:07,364
How was Joan?

2
00:00:07,442 --> 00:00:08,858
Broke up with her.

3
00:00:08,858 --> 00:00:10,274
Oh, why?

4
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:13,439
Don't tell me. Because of the big nostril thing?

5
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:16,283
They were huge.

6
00:00:17,252 --> 00:00:19,345
When she sneezed, bats flew out.

7
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:22,289
They were not that huge.

8
00:00:22,357 --> 00:00:25,451
She leaned back, I could see her brain.

9
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:31,558
How many women will you reject over superficial, insignificant--?

10
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,495
Hold it. I gotta side with Chandler.

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:44,370
When I first moved here, I went out with this girl. Hot, great kisser but she had the biggest Adam's apple.

13
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:45,503
Drove me nuts.

14
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:48,849
You or me?

15
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:50,282
I got it.

16
00:00:50,385 --> 00:00:52,512
Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.

17
00:01:00,328 --> 00:01:03,422
You guys are messing with me, right?

18
00:01:04,433 --> 00:01:06,424
Yeah. We are.

19
00:01:07,436 --> 00:01:11,338
That's a good one. For a second there, I was like, whoa!

20
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:03,314
Name one woman you broke up with for an actual real reason.

21
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,348
Maureen Rasillo.

22
00:02:05,427 --> 00:02:10,228
Because she doesn't hate Yanni is not a real reason.

23
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:15,333
Hello, Mr. Heckles.

24
00:02:16,238 --> 00:02:17,785
You're doing it again.

25
00:02:17,785 --> 00:02:19,332
We're not doing anything.

26
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:22,376
You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.

27
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:26,473
You don't have birds.

28
00:02:27,382 --> 00:02:29,350
I could have birds.

29
00:02:30,352 --> 00:02:32,286
We'll try to keep it down.

30
00:02:32,387 --> 00:02:33,445
Thank you.

31
00:02:34,256 --> 00:02:36,383
I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.

32
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:39,293
All right, bye-bye.

33
00:02:40,495 --> 00:02:41,462
Okay, Janice.

34
00:02:42,264 --> 00:02:44,494
Give me Janice. That wasn't being picky.

35
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,830
We'll give you Janice.

36
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,360
I miss Janice, though.

37
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,461
Hello, Chandler Bing.

38
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:56,403
Oh, my God.

39
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:58,376
Oh, Chandler.

40
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,414
Now. Now.

41
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:07,345
That's it. There. Faster.

42
00:03:14,429 --> 00:03:18,331
Stop with the broom. We're not making noise.

43
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:29,434
We won.

44
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:31,342
We did it.

45
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:36,280
Mr. Heckles.

46
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:41,418
How did this happen?

47
00:03:41,418 --> 00:03:42,481
He was sweeping.

48
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,452
They found a broom in his hand.

49
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:49,328
That's terrible.

50
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:50,260
I know.

51
00:03:50,465 --> 00:03:52,399
I was sweeping yesterday.

52
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,400
It could've been me.

53
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:58,305
Sweeping. You never know.

54
00:03:58,406 --> 00:03:59,464
Never know.

55
00:04:04,212 --> 00:04:08,410
It's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building.

56
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:11,351
Go into the light, Mr. Heckles.

57
00:04:15,223 --> 00:04:16,315
Okay, Phoebe.

58
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:20,326
I'm sorry, sometimes they need help.

59
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:23,380
Here we go.

60
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,331
That's fine, go ahead and scoff.

61
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:30,327
There are things I don't believe in. It doesn't mean they're not true.

62
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:31,462
Such as?

63
00:04:32,274 --> 00:04:37,541
Like crop circles or the Bermuda Triangle or evolution.

64
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:42,473
You don't believe in evolution?

65
00:04:43,285 --> 00:04:44,343
Not really.

66
00:04:46,388 --> 00:04:48,839
You don't believe in evolution?

67
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:51,290
I don't know. It's just, you know....

68
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:57,355
Monkeys, Darwin, it's a nice story. I think it's a little too easy.

69
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:02,302
''Too easy''? Too--

70
00:05:02,337 --> 00:05:10,335
The process of living things on the planet evolving over years from single-celled organisms is ''too easy''?

72
00:05:11,313 --> 00:05:13,304
Yeah, I just don't buy it.

73
00:05:14,316 --> 00:05:18,309
Excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe.

74
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:24,255
Evolution is scientific fact, like the air we breathe like gravity.

76
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:27,419
Don't get me started on gravity.

77
00:05:30,432 --> 00:05:33,424
You don't believe in gravity?

78
00:05:35,236 --> 00:05:39,263
Well, it's not so much that, you know, I don't believe in it.

79
00:05:39,374 --> 00:05:44,437
I get the feeling that I'm not being pulled down so much as I am being pushed.

81
00:05:45,246 --> 00:05:46,235
Pushed.

82
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,443
It's Isaac Newton and he's pissed.

83
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:54,448
Quick, Pheebs, hop on the ceiling.

84
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,450
There she is. And there, that's the other one.

85
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:03,322
Mr. Buddy Doyle, Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk.

86
00:06:03,398 --> 00:06:05,366
What can we do for you?

87
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,334
All right, here's the deal.

88
00:06:07,402 --> 00:06:18,344
According to my client's will he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to ''the noisy girls in the apartment above mine.''

91
00:06:19,414 --> 00:06:21,245
What about his family?

92
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:22,509
He didn't have any.

93
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:27,215
Okay, so let's talk money.

94
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:30,321
There was none.

95
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:32,223
Now, let's talk signing.

96
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:35,353
You be noisy girl number one. And number two.

97
00:06:37,265 --> 00:06:40,257
I can't believe that we thought he hated us.

98
00:06:40,368 --> 00:06:46,273
It's amazing how much you can touch someone's life without even knowing it.

100
00:06:46,374 --> 00:06:50,367
Look at this dump! He hated us. It's his final revenge.

101
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,242
I've never seen so much crap.

102
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:56,478
I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap.

103
00:06:57,485 --> 00:06:59,350
Check this out.

104
00:07:01,322 --> 00:07:02,482
Can I have this?

105
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:07,284
How can you not believe in evolution?

106
00:07:07,395 --> 00:07:11,195
I don't know, just don't. Look at this funky shirt.

107
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:14,402
I've studied evolution my entire adult life.

108
00:07:15,203 --> 00:07:22,206
We've collected fossils from all over the world that show the evolution of different species.

110
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:28,441
I mean, you can literally see them evolving through time.

112
00:07:29,417 --> 00:07:31,510
Really? You can actually see it?

113
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:36,451
You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over.

114
00:07:37,425 --> 00:07:39,359
See, I didn't know that.

115
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:42,253
Well, there you go.

116
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:48,468
So now the real question is, who put those fossils there and why?

117
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,340
Look at this. My Big Book of Grievances.

118
00:07:59,247 --> 00:08:00,305
Hey, there's me.

119
00:08:01,282 --> 00:08:07,220
''April 1 7th, excessive noise Italian guy comes home with a date.''

121
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:09,281
You're in here too.

122
00:08:09,424 --> 00:08:16,320
''April 18th, excessive noise Italian guy's gay roommate brings home dry cleaning.''

124
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:24,432
Well, that's excellent.

125
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:30,405
Look at this lamp. Is it tacky or what? We have to have it.

126
00:08:31,212 --> 00:08:33,339
I think we have enough regular lamps.

127
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:38,442
What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girlie clock or anything.

128
00:08:39,254 --> 00:08:42,417
Which, by the way, I also think is really cool.

129
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:45,255
It doesn't go with any of my stuff.

130
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,793
What about my stuff?

131
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,226
You don't have any.

132
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:50,354
It will be the start of my stuff.

133
00:08:50,498 --> 00:08:52,363
No.

134
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:56,431
You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?

135
00:08:57,238 --> 00:08:58,284
No.

136
00:08:58,284 --> 00:08:59,330
Yes, you do.

137
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:04,277
You think of it as your apartment, and I just rent a room.

138
00:09:05,413 --> 00:09:11,283
While you ''mmm'' on that, I'll find a place for my new lamp.

139
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:17,419
Okay. See how I'm making these little toys move?

140
00:09:19,427 --> 00:09:21,418
Opposable thumbs.

141
00:09:23,197 --> 00:09:27,327
Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?

142
00:09:28,303 --> 00:09:32,296
Maybe the Overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.

143
00:09:33,308 --> 00:09:34,400
Tell me you're joking.

144
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:39,246
Can't we say that you believe in something and I don't?

145
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:45,319
No, Pheebs, we can't. Because it's like math. One plus one equals two.

146
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:51,414
I can't let you think that it might equal three or four or yellow.

147
00:09:53,361 --> 00:09:56,353
Why not? No, what is that all about?

148
00:09:56,431 --> 00:10:00,458
What is this obsessive need to make everybody agree with you?

149
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:07,230
You know what? I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.

150
00:10:10,478 --> 00:10:14,278
Is there blood coming out of my ears?

151
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,442
Check it out. Heckles' high-school yearbook.

152
00:10:20,254 --> 00:10:21,818
He looks so normal.

153
00:10:21,818 --> 00:10:23,382
He's even kind of cute.

154
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:28,361
''You crack me up in science. You're the funniest kid in school.''

155
00:10:28,463 --> 00:10:29,959
Funniest? Heckles?

156
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:31,455
That's what it says.

157
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,360
Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I.

158
00:10:37,271 --> 00:10:39,398
He was right. Would you listen to that?

159
00:10:39,507 --> 00:10:42,271
I'd call that excessive.

160
00:10:42,377 --> 00:10:42,871
Whoa.

161
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:43,365
What?

162
00:10:43,478 --> 00:10:47,278
Heckles played clarinet in band. I played clarinet.

163
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:50,508
He was in the scale modeler's club and I was--

164
00:10:51,285 --> 00:10:54,277
There was no club. I thought they were cool.

165
00:10:54,422 --> 00:10:56,515
So? You were both dorks.

166
00:10:57,325 --> 00:10:58,314
Big deal.

167
00:10:58,526 --> 00:11:01,461
I just think it's weird. Heckles and me--

168
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,230
Heckles and me. Me--

169
00:11:04,365 --> 00:11:08,324
Me and Heckles. Hey, would you knock it off?!

170
00:11:27,455 --> 00:11:29,286
Been here all night?

171
00:11:29,457 --> 00:11:33,450
Look at this. Pictures of the women Heckles went out with.

172
00:11:33,561 --> 00:11:37,463
Look what he wrote on them. ''Vivian, too tall.''

173
00:11:37,498 --> 00:11:39,398
''Madge, big gums.''

174
00:11:40,468 --> 00:11:41,457
''Too loud.''

175
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:46,263
''Too smart.'' ''Makes noise when she eats.'' This is me.

176
00:11:46,374 --> 00:11:48,274
This is what I do.

177
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,308
I'll end up alone, just like him.

178
00:11:52,413 --> 00:11:54,392
Heckles was a nutcase.

179
00:11:54,392 --> 00:11:56,371
Our trains are on the same track.

180
00:11:56,417 --> 00:12:00,251
I'm 30 years behind him, but the stops are the same.

181
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:04,450
Bitter Town Aloneville, Hermit Junction.

183
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:10,423
We gotta get you out of here. I'll buy you breakfast. Let's go.

184
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:12,522
What if I never find somebody?

185
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:18,261
What if I found her but dumped her because she pronounces it, supposably?

186
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:21,374
Chandler, come on, you'll find somebody.

187
00:12:21,476 --> 00:12:23,444
How do you know that? How?

188
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:26,440
I don't. I'm just trying to help you.

189
00:12:27,348 --> 00:12:31,284
You guys will all get married and I'll end up alone.

190
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:33,443
Will you promise me something?

191
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:37,281
When you're married, invite me over for holidays?

192
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:39,359
I don't know what we're doing.

193
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:45,456
What if we're over at her folks' place?

194
00:12:47,568 --> 00:12:50,264
Yeah, I understand.

195
00:12:53,374 --> 00:12:57,470
You can come watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?

196
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,306
You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this.

197
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,316
I'll see you, man.

198
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:15,320
Supposably.

199
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:19,426
Supposably.

200
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:24,361
Did they go to the zoo?

201
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:26,463
Supposably.

202
00:13:39,387 --> 00:13:41,446
Hi. It's me.

203
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:46,351
Oh, my God.

204
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:49,486
Janice? You called Janice?

205
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:54,493
Yes. Janice. Why is that difficult to comprehend?

206
00:13:55,303 --> 00:13:57,362
You remember Janice, right?

207
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:03,207
Yes. She was smart, she was pretty and she honestly cared about me.

208
00:14:03,244 --> 00:14:06,213
Janice is my last chance to have somebody.

209
00:14:07,315 --> 00:14:09,408
Hello.

210
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:15,217
Oh, my God.

211
00:14:17,325 --> 00:14:18,451
Look how fat she got.

212
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:22,445
Hey, it's everybody.

213
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,362
Hi, Janice.

214
00:14:24,465 --> 00:14:26,365
Janice, you're....

215
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,265
Yes, I am.

216
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:29,851
Is it--?

217
00:14:29,851 --> 00:14:30,465
Is it yours?

218
00:14:31,272 --> 00:14:33,263
You wish, Chandler Bing.

219
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:37,477
You are looking at a married lady now.

220
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:44,351
Congratulations.

221
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:49,345
Sweetie, I'm sorry. I couldn't wait for you forever.

222
00:14:49,457 --> 00:14:51,971
You couldn't tell me on the phone?

223
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:54,485
And miss the expression on your face?

224
00:14:55,263 --> 00:14:57,458
Oh, no. Janice likes to have her fun.

225
00:15:09,443 --> 00:15:10,939
Know what we haven't done in a while?

226
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:12,435
What?

227
00:15:13,314 --> 00:15:14,440
Hide the lamp.

228
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,350
Monica, let it go.

229
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,413
You know I'm allergic to shellfish?

230
00:15:22,223 --> 00:15:25,420
Then you'll just have to eat the other lamps.

231
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,457
It's scary scientist man.

232
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,267
Okay, Phoebe, this is it.

233
00:15:35,369 --> 00:15:39,271
In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts.

234
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:42,240
A briefcase of facts, if you will.

235
00:15:44,345 --> 00:15:49,339
Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.

236
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:52,477
Before you even start, I'm not denying evolution.

237
00:15:53,254 --> 00:15:55,302
It's one of the possibilities.

238
00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:57,350
It's the only possibility.

239
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:01,485
Ross, could you open your mind, like, this much?

240
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:07,333
Didn't the brightest minds in the world believe the Earth was flat?

241
00:16:07,435 --> 00:16:17,400
Up until 50 years ago, you thought the atom was the smallest thing until you split it open and a mess of crap came out.

243
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:30,314
Are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit there's a teeny, tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?

246
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:46,466
There might be...a teeny...tiny...possibility.

250
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:50,433
I can't believe you caved.

251
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:57,349
You just abandoned your whole belief system.

252
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:02,220
Before, I didn't agree with you, but I respected you.

253
00:17:02,323 --> 00:17:04,257
But--

254
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,191
How are you going into work tomorrow?

255
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,195
How will you face the other science guys?

256
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,199
How are you going to face yourself?

257
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,408
That was fun. So who's hungry?

258
00:17:30,451 --> 00:17:31,440
I am.

259
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:34,244
Me too. Let me just get my coat.

260
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:47,223
It was an accident, I swear.

261
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:51,260
I was putting on my jacket... and the Iamp...and it broke.

262
00:17:51,372 --> 00:17:54,466
Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp.

263
00:17:55,242 --> 00:17:59,303
And all of a sudden, it's just magically, it's just broken?

264
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,369
Phoebe, tell her?

265
00:18:01,182 --> 00:18:04,174
I didn't see it, I was putting on my jacket.

266
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:05,411
I want to believe you.

267
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:14,216
Hey, Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.

268
00:18:14,395 --> 00:18:15,419
Neat.

269
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,198
I'm gonna die alone.

270
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:22,302
Okay, you win.

271
00:18:23,204 --> 00:18:25,399
Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.

272
00:18:26,307 --> 00:18:31,210
Janice was my safety net. And now I have to get a snake.

273
00:18:32,313 --> 00:18:33,245
Why is that?

274
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:38,410
If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'll need a thing. You know, a hook?

275
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,518
Like that guy who eats his own face.

276
00:18:42,423 --> 00:18:46,257
So I'll be ''Crazy Man With A Snake.'' ''Crazy Snake Man.''

277
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:51,264
I'll get more snakes, call them my babies. Kids will run past my place.

278
00:18:51,332 --> 00:18:54,358
''Run away from Crazy Snake Man,'' they'll shout.

279
00:18:57,471 --> 00:19:00,269
You've got to get over this.

280
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,854
You won't end up alone.

281
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:03,401
Of course I will.

282
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:11,413
I reject anyone who's crazy enough to go out with me then I bitch that there are no great women out there.

284
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:19,384
You have just described almost every man that we've ever gone out with.

285
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,387
You are not a freak. You're a guy.

286
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:27,426
She's right. You all do it.

287
00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:32,332
This one guy stopped seeing me because his cat didn't like me.

288
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:35,398
Or because I fell asleep during Spinal Tap.

289
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:38,411
You fell asleep during Spinal Tap?

290
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:43,405
Teddy, who stopped seeing you because you were too fat.

291
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:49,251
He said he didn't have time for me because of the play.

292
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:51,223
That's what I said.

293
00:19:52,226 --> 00:19:55,423
My point being, you are no different than the rest.

294
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:59,427
Wait a minute. Yes, he is. You are totally different.

295
00:20:00,234 --> 00:20:01,223
In a bad way?

296
00:20:01,335 --> 00:20:04,532
No, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now.

297
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:06,432
Most guys don't know.

298
00:20:07,241 --> 00:20:10,472
You're ready to take risks, be vulnerable and intimate.

299
00:20:11,245 --> 00:20:12,439
You won't end up alone.

300
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,543
You called Janice. That's how much you wanted to be with someone.

301
00:20:20,454 --> 00:20:21,421
You've made it.

302
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:22,388
You're there.

303
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:25,356
You are ready to make a commitment.

304
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,451
Don't know about that.

305
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:36,297
What you got there?

306
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:39,463
Something else that's not yours you can break?

307
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:45,368
I know you like this. I want you to have it.

308
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:48,472
It'll look good in our apartment.

309
00:20:49,283 --> 00:20:50,477
Thank you.

310
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:58,388
That's fine.

311
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:04,354
You'll be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night.

312
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:07,263
Allison from work. She is great.

313
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:09,359
She's pretty, she's smart.

314
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:17,472
I've been holding off asking her out, because she has...an unusually large head.

316
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:21,442
But I won't let that stuff hang me up anymore.

317
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:24,346
Look at me, I'm growing.

318
00:21:25,286 --> 00:21:27,481
You can't recycle yearbooks, can you?

319
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:29,479
I'll take that.

320
00:21:30,257 --> 00:21:31,252
You want his yearbook?

321
00:21:31,252 --> 00:21:32,247
Yeah.

322
00:21:32,293 --> 00:21:35,490
People said nice things. Somebody should have it.

323
00:21:36,263 --> 00:21:38,356
Gosh, this is so weird.

324
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:43,266
His whole life was in this apartment and now it's gone.

325
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,466
It would be nice if we just took a few moments for Mr. Heckles.

326
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:52,468
He was kind of a pain. He was, but he was a person.

327
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:01,217
You're all going to hell.

328
00:22:01,322 --> 00:22:03,347
It's really not that big.

329
00:22:06,427 --> 00:22:07,877
Taking that with you?

330
00:22:07,877 --> 00:22:09,327
Oh, yeah.

331
00:22:15,235 --> 00:22:16,429
Hey, you coming?

332
00:22:17,338 --> 00:22:19,272
Yeah, in a second.

333
00:22:34,455 --> 00:22:36,446
Goodbye, Mr. Heckles.

334
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,251
We'll try to keep it down.

335
00:22:52,373 --> 00:22:53,499
My major was useless.

336
00:22:54,308 --> 00:22:58,301
How often do the classifieds say ''Philosopher Wanted''?

337
00:22:58,379 --> 00:22:59,505
Sure.

338
00:23:00,247 --> 00:23:02,306
My God, that's a big head.

339
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:08,218
It didn't look this big in the office. Maybe it's the lighting.

340
00:23:08,322 --> 00:23:11,348
My head must look like a golf ball at work.

341
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:16,320
Don't get hung up on it. List five things you like about her.

342
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,364
Nice smile, good dresser.

343
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:21,332
Big head, big head, big head.
