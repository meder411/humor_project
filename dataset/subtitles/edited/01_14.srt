1
00:00:02,451 --> 00:00:04,442
Ross, she wants you.

2
00:00:05,253 --> 00:00:07,414
We just live in the same building.

3
00:00:08,256 --> 00:00:09,302
Any contact?

4
00:00:09,302 --> 00:00:10,348
She lent me an egg.

5
00:00:10,425 --> 00:00:12,393
You're in!

6
00:00:12,393 --> 00:00:14,361
Right.

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,422
Hey, Ross.

8
00:00:22,437 --> 00:00:25,338
Come on. Get back in the game.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,891
The Rachel thing isn't happening,

10
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:30,342
your ex-wife's a lesbian....

11
00:00:30,445 --> 00:00:32,436
I don't think we need a third.

12
00:00:33,248 --> 00:00:34,744
Could we get an egg,

13
00:00:34,744 --> 00:00:36,240
still in the shell?

14
00:00:36,351 --> 00:00:37,340
An egg?

15
00:00:37,386 --> 00:00:39,866
Go up to her and say,

16
00:00:39,866 --> 00:00:42,346
''I'm returning your egg.''

17
00:00:43,258 --> 00:00:45,351
I think it's winning.

18
00:00:45,394 --> 00:00:46,924
It's insane.

19
00:00:46,924 --> 00:00:48,454
She'll love it.

20
00:00:49,297 --> 00:00:51,293
Thank you.

21
00:00:51,293 --> 00:00:53,289
Thank you. Here.

22
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,262
Go with the egg, my friend.

23
00:00:59,374 --> 00:01:01,399
Go, go, go!

24
00:01:03,412 --> 00:01:04,925
Think it'll work?

25
00:01:04,925 --> 00:01:06,438
No way. It's suicide.

26
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,294
You can't do this.

27
00:01:58,294 --> 00:01:59,289
Do what?

28
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:01,852
Roger wants to take her out.

29
00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:04,303
No! Remember why you dumped him?

30
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,237
Because he was creepy.

31
00:02:07,342 --> 00:02:09,310
And mean. And frightening.

32
00:02:09,344 --> 00:02:11,778
Still, it's nice to have

33
00:02:11,778 --> 00:02:14,212
a date on Valentine's Day!

34
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:17,249
You can go out with a creep any night.

35
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,414
I know I do.

36
00:02:22,424 --> 00:02:24,938
What are you doing tomorrow night?

37
00:02:24,938 --> 00:02:27,452
That depends on how tonight goes.

38
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,743
About tonight--

39
00:02:29,743 --> 00:02:31,256
Don't you bail on me!

40
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:33,284
I said I'd bring a friend

41
00:02:33,284 --> 00:02:35,235
for her friend.

42
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,300
But her friend sounds like a--

43
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,330
Pathetic mess. I know, but....

44
00:02:40,242 --> 00:02:42,437
Come on. She's needy, vulnerable.

45
00:02:42,477 --> 00:02:45,446
I'm thinking....

46
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:51,285
Thanks.

47
00:02:51,353 --> 00:02:53,401
You haven't been out with a woman

48
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:55,449
since Janice. You're doing this.

49
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,373
She said yes.

50
00:03:00,373 --> 00:03:02,386
Way to go, man!

51
00:03:03,231 --> 00:03:05,324
Still got the egg, huh?

52
00:03:18,413 --> 00:03:20,404
How do I look?

53
00:03:21,249 --> 00:03:23,410
I don't care.

54
00:03:26,421 --> 00:03:28,412
There's Lorraine.

55
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:30,356
No trading. You get the pretty one,

56
00:03:30,356 --> 00:03:32,256
I get the mess.

57
00:03:32,427 --> 00:03:34,418
Hi, Joey.

58
00:03:37,265 --> 00:03:38,795
Well, well!

59
00:03:38,795 --> 00:03:40,325
Look what you brought!

60
00:03:40,468 --> 00:03:43,232
Very nice.

61
00:03:43,338 --> 00:03:46,364
And what did you bring?

62
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,441
She's checking her coat.

63
00:03:49,244 --> 00:03:50,791
I'm gonna wash the cab smell

64
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:52,338
off of my hands.

65
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,428
Get me a white zinfandel,

66
00:03:54,428 --> 00:03:56,476
and a glass of red for Janice.

67
00:04:01,223 --> 00:04:03,282
Janice?

68
00:04:04,226 --> 00:04:06,285
Janice!?

69
00:04:06,428 --> 00:04:11,331
Oh my God!

72
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:17,433
Hey, it's Janice!

73
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:25,438
Okay, I'm making a break for it!

74
00:04:26,214 --> 00:04:28,313
I've been waiting for, like, forever

75
00:04:28,313 --> 00:04:30,412
to go out with Lorraine.

76
00:04:31,219 --> 00:04:32,231
Just calm down.

77
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,243
Calm down?

78
00:04:33,321 --> 00:04:35,386
You set me up with a woman I've

79
00:04:35,386 --> 00:04:37,451
dumped twice in the last five months!

80
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,490
Can you stop yelling?

81
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,520
You're making me nervous and....

82
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:48,234
I can't go when I'm nervous.

83
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:50,463
I'm sorry, you're right.

84
00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:57,334
Come on! Do it, do it!

85
00:04:59,347 --> 00:05:01,264
Roger was creepy, but he was nothing

86
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:03,181
compared to Pete.

87
00:05:03,285 --> 00:05:04,252
Who?

88
00:05:04,252 --> 00:05:05,219
Pete the Weeper.

89
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,299
The guy that used to cry

90
00:05:07,299 --> 00:05:09,278
every time we had sex?

91
00:05:09,324 --> 00:05:13,226
''Was it good for you?''

92
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:16,259
I'd take crying any day

93
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,289
over Howard, the ''I win'' guy!

94
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,392
''I win! I win!''

95
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:24,216
We went out for two months.

96
00:05:24,216 --> 00:05:26,195
I didn't win once.

97
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:29,404
How do we end up with these jerks?

98
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:32,413
We're some kind of magnets.

99
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:34,443
I know I am. That's why I can't

100
00:05:34,443 --> 00:05:36,439
wear a digital watch.

101
00:05:39,354 --> 00:05:42,221
There's more beer, right?

102
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:47,260
You know my friend who shaves her head?

103
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:48,418
No.

104
00:05:48,463 --> 00:05:50,346
I have this friend

105
00:05:50,346 --> 00:05:52,229
who shaves her head.

106
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:53,801
She says to break the

107
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:58,363
bad boyfriend cycle you can do a cleansing ritual.

109
00:06:00,275 --> 00:06:02,323
Pheebs, this woman

110
00:06:02,323 --> 00:06:04,371
is voluntarily bald.

111
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,406
Yeah.

112
00:06:07,282 --> 00:06:09,409
We can do it tomorrow night.

113
00:06:10,218 --> 00:06:11,247
It's Valentine's Day.

114
00:06:11,247 --> 00:06:12,276
It's perfect.

115
00:06:12,387 --> 00:06:14,412
Okay, what kind of ritual?

116
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,320
We can burn the stuff they gave us.

117
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:21,287
Or...?

118
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:24,394
Or we can chant and dance

119
00:06:24,394 --> 00:06:27,392
around naked with sticks.

120
00:06:29,437 --> 00:06:32,406
Burning's good.

121
00:06:41,316 --> 00:06:47,348
You know I can pick up quarters with my toes.

123
00:06:47,455 --> 00:06:49,406
Yeah?

124
00:06:49,406 --> 00:06:51,357
Good for you.

125
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:56,354
Quarters or rolls of quarters?

126
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:03,437
By the way, I cut you out of

127
00:07:03,437 --> 00:07:05,405
all of my pictures.

128
00:07:06,174 --> 00:07:08,324
So if you want, I have a bag

129
00:07:08,324 --> 00:07:10,474
with just your heads.

130
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:12,406
That's okay.

131
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:14,879
You could make little puppets

132
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,477
out of them.

133
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:19,300
And you could use them in your

134
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,382
Theater of Cruelty!

135
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:25,775
We can't do that!

136
00:07:25,775 --> 00:07:28,226
What? What can't you do?

137
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:33,266
Can I talk to you for a second?

138
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:35,200
Over there?

139
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:43,437
We might be leaving now.

140
00:07:44,212 --> 00:07:47,204
Tell me it's you and me ''we.''

141
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:49,244
She wants to slather my body

142
00:07:49,244 --> 00:07:51,240
with stuff and lick it off.

143
00:07:51,352 --> 00:07:54,344
I'm not even sure what slathering is!

144
00:07:54,422 --> 00:07:56,339
But I definitely want

145
00:07:56,339 --> 00:07:58,256
to be a part of it!

146
00:07:58,426 --> 00:08:02,260
Okay, you cannot do this to me.

147
00:08:02,397 --> 00:08:05,161
You're right. I'm sorry.

148
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:07,365
Can we have three

149
00:08:07,365 --> 00:08:09,464
chocolate mousses to go?

150
00:08:10,271 --> 00:08:12,398
I'm out of here.

151
00:08:13,374 --> 00:08:15,291
Here's my credit card.

152
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,208
Dinner's on me.

153
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:20,213
I hope she throws up on you.

154
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:24,174
Thanks.

155
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,804
So....

156
00:08:26,804 --> 00:08:28,288
Just us.

157
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:31,187
What a crappy night!

158
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:36,243
I have enjoyed the fact that your shirt's been

160
00:08:36,243 --> 00:08:38,291
sticking out of your zipper.

161
00:08:43,404 --> 00:08:46,237
Excuse me.

162
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:51,301
How you doing?

163
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:56,416
So do we have the best friends,

164
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,350
or what?

165
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:00,387
Joey's not a friend.

166
00:09:00,387 --> 00:09:05,205
He's a stupid man who left us

168
00:09:05,205 --> 00:09:07,253
his credit card.

169
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:09,313
Another drink? Dessert?

170
00:09:09,313 --> 00:09:11,264
A big-screen TV?

171
00:09:11,366 --> 00:09:12,862
I'll have a drink.

172
00:09:12,862 --> 00:09:14,358
Got it. Good woman!

173
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,922
A bottle of overpriced champagne.

174
00:09:21,922 --> 00:09:23,469
Each.

175
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:25,844
That's right, each.

176
00:09:25,844 --> 00:09:27,476
And a rob roy.

177
00:09:28,216 --> 00:09:30,184
I've always wanted to know.

178
00:09:48,202 --> 00:09:53,333
Happy Valentine's Day!

179
00:09:59,414 --> 00:10:03,407
Oh, I miss you already.

180
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:04,947
Can you believe this happened?

181
00:10:04,947 --> 00:10:06,443
No, no!

182
00:10:08,423 --> 00:10:10,516
And yet it did.

183
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:12,755
Goodbye, Janice.

184
00:10:12,755 --> 00:10:14,251
Kiss me!

185
00:10:16,264 --> 00:10:18,323
Oh, Chandler. Sorry.

186
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:21,527
Oh, Chandler. Sorry!

187
00:10:23,271 --> 00:10:24,300
Hey, Janice.

188
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,329
Hi, Monica.

189
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,433
Well, this was very special.

190
00:10:29,477 --> 00:10:32,537
Rach, come see who's out here!

191
00:10:33,281 --> 00:10:36,250
What's going on? Oh, my God!

192
00:10:36,351 --> 00:10:38,444
Janice! Hi!

193
00:10:38,553 --> 00:10:42,489
Janice is gonna go away now!

194
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,393
I'll be right back.

195
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:49,486
Joey! Look who it is!

196
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:54,393
Good. Joey's home.

197
00:10:54,469 --> 00:10:57,302
This is so much fun!

198
00:10:57,372 --> 00:11:01,240
This is like a reunion in the hall!

199
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:04,339
Ross, there's someone

200
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:06,335
I want you to say hi to.

201
00:11:07,515 --> 00:11:09,312
He happened to call.

202
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,830
Hi, Ross. That's right, it's me!

203
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,310
How did you know?

204
00:11:29,437 --> 00:11:35,454
So, if dogs experience jet lag because of the seven dog years

206
00:11:35,454 --> 00:11:39,809
to one human year thing when a dog flies

208
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:43,946
from New York to Los Angeles he doesn't just lose three hours,

210
00:11:43,946 --> 00:11:46,443
he loses a week and a half.

211
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,282
That's funny!

212
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,233
They should be cooking the food soon.

213
00:12:02,336 --> 00:12:03,496
Oh, good.

214
00:12:14,215 --> 00:12:15,307
Who are they?

215
00:12:15,349 --> 00:12:18,284
The blond is my ex-wife.

216
00:12:18,284 --> 00:12:24,348
The woman touching her is her close, personal friend.

218
00:12:26,227 --> 00:12:28,724
They're lovers?

219
00:12:28,724 --> 00:12:31,221
If you want to put a label on it.

220
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:35,318
Anything else I should know?

221
00:12:35,318 --> 00:12:37,269
Nope. That's it.

222
00:12:37,472 --> 00:12:41,431
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby.

223
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:48,271
I always forget that part.

224
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:50,476
Hello!

225
00:12:56,257 --> 00:12:59,226
Now we need sage branches

226
00:12:59,226 --> 00:13:02,195
and the sacramental wine.

227
00:13:03,197 --> 00:13:06,223
All I had is oregano and a Fresca.

228
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,393
That's okay!

229
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,820
Now we need the semen

230
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,300
of a righteous man.

231
00:13:22,216 --> 00:13:24,781
If we had that, we wouldn't be doing

232
00:13:24,781 --> 00:13:27,346
the ritual in the first place.

233
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:29,838
Can we start throwing things in?

234
00:13:29,838 --> 00:13:32,255
Yeah, okay!

235
00:13:35,229 --> 00:13:36,326
Okay.

236
00:13:36,326 --> 00:13:37,423
Barry's letters.

237
00:13:37,532 --> 00:13:40,365
Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.

238
00:13:40,434 --> 00:13:43,335
And I have the receipt

239
00:13:43,335 --> 00:13:46,236
from my dinner with....

240
00:13:48,476 --> 00:13:50,410
A picture of Scotty Jared naked!

241
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,344
Let me see!

242
00:13:52,446 --> 00:13:54,346
He's wearing a sweater.

243
00:13:54,346 --> 00:13:56,246
No.

244
00:14:00,421 --> 00:14:01,905
Whose MCI card is that?

245
00:14:01,905 --> 00:14:03,389
Mine. Shoot!

246
00:14:04,192 --> 00:14:06,291
Remember this number:

247
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,390
Nine, seven, four....

248
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:11,813
Okay, and here we have

249
00:14:11,813 --> 00:14:13,428
the last of Paolo's grappa.

250
00:14:14,202 --> 00:14:16,397
Wait, isn't it almost pure--

251
00:14:20,508 --> 00:14:22,459
How can I dump this woman

252
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:24,410
on Valentine's Day?

253
00:14:24,512 --> 00:14:26,429
I don't know.

254
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:28,346
You dumped her on New Year's.

255
00:14:29,217 --> 00:14:31,265
In my next life,

256
00:14:31,265 --> 00:14:33,313
I'm coming back as a toilet brush.

257
00:14:34,455 --> 00:14:38,255
Hello, funny valentine!

258
00:14:38,326 --> 00:14:40,453
Hi, just Janice.

259
00:14:41,262 --> 00:14:44,231
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker.

260
00:14:44,265 --> 00:14:45,812
I could just kiss you all over,

261
00:14:45,812 --> 00:14:47,359
and I'm gonna.

262
00:14:52,373 --> 00:14:56,332
If you don't do it, I will.

263
00:15:15,196 --> 00:15:17,761
So are you actually from New York?

264
00:15:17,761 --> 00:15:20,326
Not originally. I'm from--

265
00:15:20,434 --> 00:15:22,430
You said they'd shoot it without you.

266
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,426
I thought they could.

267
00:15:25,206 --> 00:15:28,204
The maxi-pads were a piece of cake.

268
00:15:28,204 --> 00:15:31,202
Mini-pads should be that much easier.

269
00:15:31,245 --> 00:15:33,241
It's Valentine's Day.

270
00:15:33,241 --> 00:15:35,237
I know, but it's my job.

271
00:15:35,316 --> 00:15:36,829
I'll try to get back

272
00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:38,342
as soon as I can.

273
00:15:38,452 --> 00:15:39,948
I'm spending most of my time

274
00:15:39,948 --> 00:15:44,339
teaching science which is funny because

276
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:46,455
that wasn't even my major.

277
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:01,174
Now, that is funny!

278
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,758
Do you think it would be too weird

279
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:08,306
if I invited Carol over to join us?

280
00:16:08,382 --> 00:16:11,334
Because she's alone now.

281
00:16:11,334 --> 00:16:14,286
And pregnant. And sad.

282
00:16:14,322 --> 00:16:16,301
I guess.

283
00:16:16,301 --> 00:16:18,280
Are you sure? Carol!

284
00:16:18,392 --> 00:16:19,859
Wanna join us?

285
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:21,326
No, I'm fine.

286
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:22,942
Come on.

287
00:16:22,942 --> 00:16:24,489
These people will scooch down.

288
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,765
You guys will scooch, won't you?

289
00:16:28,765 --> 00:16:31,330
Let's try scooching! Come on!

290
00:16:31,405 --> 00:16:32,918
Come on.

291
00:16:32,918 --> 00:16:34,431
Thank you.

292
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,223
Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick.

293
00:16:38,223 --> 00:16:40,236
Carol, Kristen.

294
00:16:40,348 --> 00:16:42,299
How do you do?

295
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:44,250
Carol teaches sixth grade.

296
00:16:44,418 --> 00:16:47,251
And Kristen....

297
00:16:50,324 --> 00:17:01,197
Kristen does something that, funnily enough wasn't even her major!

300
00:17:03,204 --> 00:17:05,286
Thanks for coming over.

301
00:17:05,286 --> 00:17:07,368
Not at all. It's pretty much our job.

302
00:17:07,408 --> 00:17:10,377
That's why we get the cool hats.

303
00:17:10,411 --> 00:17:12,828
What do we got there?

304
00:17:12,828 --> 00:17:15,245
A piece of silk boxer shorts.

305
00:17:15,316 --> 00:17:17,409
Some greeting cards.

306
00:17:18,386 --> 00:17:21,253
A half-charred picture of....

307
00:17:21,322 --> 00:17:24,382
That guy's hairier than the chief!

308
00:17:27,395 --> 00:17:29,346
It's a really funny story

309
00:17:29,346 --> 00:17:31,297
how this happened.

310
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:34,300
I was taking out the trash,

311
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,201
and Phoebe was burning incense--

312
00:17:37,238 --> 00:17:38,330
It's all right.

313
00:17:38,406 --> 00:17:40,920
This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire

314
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,434
we've seen get out of control.

315
00:17:44,345 --> 00:17:45,391
Third one tonight.

316
00:17:45,391 --> 00:17:46,437
Really?

317
00:17:47,214 --> 00:17:49,227
Valentine's is our

318
00:17:49,227 --> 00:17:51,240
busiest night of the year.

319
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:54,851
Next time you're burning

320
00:17:54,851 --> 00:17:56,415
your ex-boyfriend's stuff:

321
00:17:56,457 --> 00:17:59,426
One, do it in a well-ventilated area.

322
00:17:59,527 --> 00:18:02,343
Two, if you wanna burn his clothing,

323
00:18:02,343 --> 00:18:05,159
stay away from synthetic fabrics.

324
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:07,798
Three, try to let go of the anger,

325
00:18:07,798 --> 00:18:10,397
and learn to love yourself.

326
00:18:13,174 --> 00:18:14,789
I brought you something.

327
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:16,404
Is it loaded?

328
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:23,279
Oh, little candy hearts.

329
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:26,277
''Chan and Jan Forever.''

330
00:18:27,188 --> 00:18:29,383
I had them made special.

331
00:18:32,426 --> 00:18:35,395
Okay, Janice.

332
00:18:37,431 --> 00:18:40,332
Hey, Janice.

333
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,396
There's no way to tell you this.

334
00:18:44,438 --> 00:18:47,305
At least, there's no new way.

335
00:18:50,311 --> 00:18:52,324
I just don't think things

336
00:18:52,324 --> 00:18:54,337
are gonna work out.

337
00:18:55,516 --> 00:18:59,350
That's fine.

338
00:19:01,155 --> 00:19:02,383
It is?

339
00:19:03,157 --> 00:19:05,307
Because I know that this

340
00:19:05,307 --> 00:19:07,457
isn't the end.

341
00:19:08,362 --> 00:19:11,160
You see, actually, it is.

342
00:19:11,198 --> 00:19:14,167
No, because you won't let that happen.

343
00:19:14,268 --> 00:19:16,168
Don't you know it yet?

344
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:20,366
You love me, Chandler Bing!

345
00:19:23,277 --> 00:19:25,302
Oh, no, I don't.

346
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:27,876
Why do we keep ending up together?

347
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:30,373
New Year's, who invited who?

348
00:19:30,484 --> 00:19:32,452
Valentine's, who asked who into bed?

349
00:19:32,452 --> 00:19:34,420
I did, but--

350
00:19:35,222 --> 00:19:36,382
You seek me out!

351
00:19:36,423 --> 00:19:38,920
Something deep in your soul

352
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,417
calls out to me like a foghorn!

353
00:19:42,229 --> 00:19:45,426
Janice! Janice!

354
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:48,229
You push me away,

355
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,225
you pull me back!

356
00:19:50,404 --> 00:19:53,237
You want me. You need me.

357
00:19:53,307 --> 00:19:55,804
You can't live without me.

358
00:19:55,804 --> 00:19:58,301
And you know it.

359
00:19:58,412 --> 00:20:04,248
You just don't know you know it.

360
00:20:07,254 --> 00:20:09,313
See?

361
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:17,424
Call me!

362
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:26,534
It's not true.

363
00:20:26,534 --> 00:20:28,530
I never called your mother a wolverine.

364
00:20:29,276 --> 00:20:32,370
You did so, I swear to--

365
00:20:35,382 --> 00:20:38,442
How long has she been in the bathroom?

366
00:20:38,552 --> 00:20:40,417
She isn't in the bathroom.

367
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:42,282
Her coat's gone.

368
00:20:42,356 --> 00:20:46,258
Well, maybe it's cold in there.

369
00:20:46,493 --> 00:20:48,376
I screwed up my first date

370
00:20:48,376 --> 00:20:50,259
in nine years.

371
00:20:50,297 --> 00:20:51,895
That could be it.

372
00:20:51,895 --> 00:20:53,493
Oh, God.

373
00:20:54,268 --> 00:20:57,567
You know, this is still pretty hot.

374
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,301
Mushroom.

375
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,401
Smile.

376
00:21:05,512 --> 00:21:07,912
They won't all be like this.

377
00:21:07,912 --> 00:21:10,312
Some might stay through dinner.

378
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:11,930
I'm sorry. That's not funny.

379
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,443
It's just....

380
00:21:14,221 --> 00:21:15,819
You know the whole

381
00:21:15,819 --> 00:21:17,417
''get on with your life'' thing?

382
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,256
Well, do I have to?

383
00:21:20,327 --> 00:21:22,795
I'm sitting here

384
00:21:22,795 --> 00:21:32,462
with this cute woman and she's perfectly nice, but that...that's it.

387
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,737
Then I'm here talking to you,

388
00:21:35,737 --> 00:21:38,234
and it's easy and it's fun.

389
00:21:38,345 --> 00:21:40,438
And I don't have to....

390
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,311
I know.

391
00:21:42,311 --> 00:21:43,374
You know?

392
00:21:46,487 --> 00:21:49,479
Here's a wacky thought.

393
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,889
Let's say you and I give it

394
00:21:51,889 --> 00:21:53,487
another shot.

395
00:21:54,261 --> 00:21:55,825
I know what you're gonna say.

396
00:21:55,825 --> 00:21:57,389
You're a lesbian.

397
00:21:58,465 --> 00:22:00,882
But what do you say we just

398
00:22:00,882 --> 00:22:03,299
put that aside for now.

399
00:22:03,404 --> 00:22:06,305
Let's just stick a pin in it.

400
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,320
Because we're great together.

401
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,300
You can't deny it.

402
00:22:12,446 --> 00:22:14,425
I've got a ring at home

403
00:22:14,425 --> 00:22:16,404
that fits you.

404
00:22:16,517 --> 00:22:18,968
I've got lots of pictures

405
00:22:18,968 --> 00:22:21,419
with both of us in them.

406
00:22:22,222 --> 00:22:24,235
And best of all,

407
00:22:24,235 --> 00:22:26,248
you're carrying my baby.

408
00:22:26,327 --> 00:22:27,777
I mean, how perfect is that?

409
00:22:27,777 --> 00:22:29,227
Ross--

410
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,895
You keep saying that, but there's

411
00:22:31,895 --> 00:22:34,460
something right here. I love you.

412
00:22:41,442 --> 00:22:44,434
I love you too.

413
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,325
But--

414
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:47,371
No ''but.''

415
00:22:48,449 --> 00:22:50,946
You know that thing we

416
00:22:50,946 --> 00:22:53,443
put over here with the pin in it?

417
00:22:55,255 --> 00:22:59,351
It's time to take the pin out.

418
00:23:04,198 --> 00:23:05,813
You'll find someone.

419
00:23:05,813 --> 00:23:07,428
The right woman is waiting for you.

420
00:23:08,235 --> 00:23:10,317
It's easy for you to say.

421
00:23:10,317 --> 00:23:12,399
You found one already.

422
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,336
All you need is a woman who likes men,

423
00:23:15,336 --> 00:23:17,332
and you'll be set.

424
00:23:20,414 --> 00:23:23,349
Not her.

425
00:23:34,361 --> 00:23:38,354
So, you guys really slide down a pole?

426
00:23:41,235 --> 00:23:43,231
Absolutely.

427
00:23:43,231 --> 00:23:45,227
That's so cool.

428
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:48,272
How do you get back up?

429
00:23:50,277 --> 00:23:52,376
Well, we rarely have to return

430
00:23:52,376 --> 00:23:54,475
from a fire as quickly.

431
00:23:57,484 --> 00:24:00,282
So, would you guys....

432
00:24:00,387 --> 00:24:05,324
Would you like to, sometime, maybe....

433
00:24:05,392 --> 00:24:07,383
Go for a drink sometime?

434
00:24:07,428 --> 00:24:09,225
Sure, sounds good.

435
00:24:09,296 --> 00:24:10,843
We get off at midnight.

436
00:24:10,843 --> 00:24:12,390
We'll pick you up then.

437
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,394
Okay. Great!

438
00:24:15,402 --> 00:24:19,304
So will you bring the truck?

439
00:24:20,407 --> 00:24:23,308
I'll even let you ring the bell.

440
00:24:23,343 --> 00:24:25,322
We'll see you later.

441
00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:27,301
Bye! See you later!

442
00:24:28,348 --> 00:24:29,406
Oh, my God!

443
00:24:31,218 --> 00:24:32,315
See? There you go.

444
00:24:32,315 --> 00:24:33,412
The cleansing worked.

445
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,512
You're right. They're nice guys!

446
00:24:37,257 --> 00:24:41,216
They're firemen guys!

447
00:24:41,261 --> 00:24:43,309
Tell them you're married?

448
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:45,357
No. My girlfriend doesn't even know.
