1
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:05,430
It's not fair! It's my money.

2
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:08,373
I know. But it's what Brad wanted.

3
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:09,857
Which one is she?

4
00:00:09,857 --> 00:00:11,273
That's Brad's widow.

5
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:12,908
Why is she so upset?

6
00:00:12,908 --> 00:00:14,438
She was cut out of the will.

7
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:16,795
Doesn't she know you can't

8
00:00:16,795 --> 00:00:18,342
define yourself by money?

9
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,967
It's about values and morals and

10
00:00:20,967 --> 00:00:23,549
your ability to give and receive love.

11
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,450
No.

12
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,855
-Oh, Drake.

13
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:29,351
-I'm sorry, Amber.

14
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:30,926
It's just like Brad to have

15
00:00:30,926 --> 00:00:32,456
to have the last word.

16
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,382
Sorry I'm late. What happened?

17
00:00:34,382 --> 00:00:36,265
We wanna see the end.

18
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,819
-I want you, Drake.

19
00:00:37,819 --> 00:00:39,269
-I know you do.

20
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,435
But we can never

21
00:00:40,435 --> 00:00:41,498
be together that way.

22
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,264
What?

23
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,873
There's something I never told you.

24
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:48,370
I'm actually your half-brother.

25
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,317
So, what happens next?

26
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:56,969
I get a medical award

27
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:58,516
for separating Siamese twins.

28
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,793
Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to

29
00:01:01,793 --> 00:01:06,343
meet our other half-brother, Ramon where I find the world's

30
00:01:06,343 --> 00:01:08,322
biggest emerald. It's really big.

31
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,369
But it's cursed.

32
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,233
So cool!

33
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:15,273
God, that is good TV!

34
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:05,991
Come on, Pheebs. Play with me!

35
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:08,459
No! This game is grotesque!

36
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,225
Twenty armless guys joined

37
00:02:11,225 --> 00:02:16,360
at the waist by a steel bar forced to play soccer forever?

38
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,461
Hello? Human rights violation!

39
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,307
Don't feel bad. After playing I break out the plastic women

40
00:02:24,307 --> 00:02:26,372
and everybody has a good time.

41
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,440
Why don't you play with your roommate?

42
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,342
He's not a big fan of foosball.

43
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:34,903
Are we not getting along

44
00:02:34,903 --> 00:02:36,353
with the new boy?

45
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,424
No, he's all right. He spends

46
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,392
most of his time in his room.

47
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,860
Because you haven't gotten

48
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,260
to know him. Let's remedy that.

49
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:46,930
We don't need to remedy that.

50
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,562
Yeah, it'll be fun!

51
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,470
What was that?

52
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,820
Hi! I just thought it'd be fun if we

53
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,368
had beers and got to know each other.

54
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,960
All right.

55
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,410
Oh, good! Okay.

56
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,880
Oh, no! I have to go

57
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,914
because I'm late for my Green Eggs and Ham

58
00:03:06,914 --> 00:03:08,410
discussion group.

59
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,450
Tonight, it's, ''Why he would not

60
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,446
eat them on a train.''

61
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,272
Have fun! Bye!

62
00:03:14,272 --> 00:03:15,318
That was so lame.

63
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,352
I know.

64
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,261
Okay, talk to him.

65
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,750
So you think that Speed Racer guy

66
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,264
gets a lot of tickets or...?

67
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,307
That's good.

68
00:03:32,307 --> 00:03:33,370
Who broke up with who?

69
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:36,461
I broke up with her. She thought Sean

70
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:39,476
Penn was the capital of Cambodia.

71
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,801
That's good! When everybody knows

72
00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:45,349
the capital of Cambodia is....

73
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,552
Well, it's not Sean Penn.

74
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:50,353
All right, I got a funny one.

75
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,331
My last girlfriend, Tilly, we're

76
00:03:53,331 --> 00:03:56,266
eating breakfast. I made 50 pancakes.

77
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,753
All of a sudden, she turns to me and

78
00:03:58,753 --> 00:04:01,204
says, ''I don't wanna see you anymore.''

79
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,372
It was like she had reached

80
00:04:03,372 --> 00:04:09,443
into my chest, ripped out my heart and smeared it all over my life!

81
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,763
There was this incredible abyss

82
00:04:11,763 --> 00:04:14,837
and I'm falling and I don't think

83
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,321
I'm ever gonna stop!

84
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,256
That wasn't such

85
00:04:22,256 --> 00:04:24,252
a funny story, was it?

86
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:29,280
A crusty old man

87
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,326
Said I'll do what I can

88
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,400
And the rest of the rats

89
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,430
Played maracas

90
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,534
That's it! Thanks! Good night.

91
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,380
Phoebe's got another job, right?

92
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:44,762
Great set tonight, Pheebs.

93
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:46,275
I know.

94
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,379
We should get going.

95
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,354
We should go too.

96
00:04:50,354 --> 00:04:52,254
I got patients in the morning.

97
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:53,825
You know how we always

98
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:55,292
stay at your place?

99
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,892
I thought we'd stay at my place.

100
00:04:57,892 --> 00:05:00,423
I don't know. I don't have my jammies.

101
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,394
You don't need them.

102
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,404
My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen.

103
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,434
Shut up. I'm happy.

104
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,823
Oh, this is so nice!

105
00:05:11,823 --> 00:05:13,336
I have to make a speech.

106
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,428
I want to say, of all the guys Monica

107
00:05:16,428 --> 00:05:23,415
has been with, and that is a lot...I like you the best.

108
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:24,940
Thank you, Pheebs.

109
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,424
That's very sweet.

110
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,318
You hear that?

111
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,892
She likes me best. And apparently,

112
00:05:30,892 --> 00:05:33,423
there have been a lot.

113
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:35,445
Not a lot. Phoebe's kidding.

114
00:05:35,445 --> 00:05:37,424
Phoebe's crazy.

115
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,432
Phoebe's dead.

116
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,474
I'm looking for Eddie Manoick.

117
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,400
He's not here now. I'm Chandler.

118
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,550
Can I take a message or a fish-tank?

119
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,819
Thanks.

120
00:05:57,819 --> 00:05:59,349
Come on in.

121
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:01,383
I'm Tilly.

122
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,949
I gather by that ''Oh,''

123
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:09,399
he told you about me.

124
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:14,473
Yeah, your name came up in a conversation that

125
00:06:14,473 --> 00:06:16,441
terrified me to my very soul.

126
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,310
He's kind of intense.

127
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:20,829
Yes! Can I ask you,

128
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:22,313
is Eddie a little--?

129
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:23,832
A little what?

130
00:06:23,832 --> 00:06:25,316
Bit country?

131
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:32,450
Or, you know, a little rock 'n' roll?

132
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,351
Come on in here, you roomie!

133
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,259
Hello, Tilly.

134
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,457
I just came by to drop off your tank.

135
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,229
That was very thoughtful of you.

136
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:44,225
It's very thoughtful.

137
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:49,468
Well, okay then.

138
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,458
I'm gonna go. Bye.

139
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,540
Bye!

140
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,444
So we getting a fish?

141
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:01,317
You had sex with her, didn't you?

142
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,836
Pheebs! Check it out,

143
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:06,383
check it out, check it out!

144
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,877
Soap Opera Digest!

145
00:07:08,877 --> 00:07:11,328
That's one of my favorite digests!

146
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:14,389
Page 42! Page 42! Page 42!

147
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,231
''New Doc on the Block,

148
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:20,227
Days of our Lives Joey Tribbiani.''

149
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,297
Cool picture!

150
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,399
Oh, I look good.

151
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,379
Is this true? That you write

152
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:29,313
a lot of your lines?

153
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,314
Well, kind of, yeah.

154
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:33,931
Remember last week

155
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:35,444
when Alex was in the accident?

156
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,770
The script said, ''If we don't get this

157
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,318
woman to a hospital she'll die.''

158
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:43,924
But I made it, ''If this woman doesn't

159
00:07:43,924 --> 00:07:46,421
get to a hospital she won't live.''

160
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:49,898
Oh, okay.

161
00:07:49,898 --> 00:07:51,462
I see what you did there.

162
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,356
Aren't you afraid the writers

163
00:07:56,356 --> 00:07:58,472
will be mad when they read this?

164
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,429
I never thought about the writers.

165
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:05,313
The scripts just come to my house.

166
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,378
But you know what?

167
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,939
This makes me look good, which makes

168
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:13,390
the show and the writers look good.

169
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,286
How could they be mad?

170
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:19,796
Makes up most of his lines.

171
00:08:19,796 --> 00:08:22,196
Son of a....

172
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:26,205
Write this,jerk-weed.

173
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:28,736
I fall down an elevator shaft?

174
00:08:28,736 --> 00:08:31,233
What the hell does this mean?

175
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,306
I don't know.

176
00:08:33,306 --> 00:08:35,302
I just bring the scripts.

177
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:37,862
They can't kill me!

178
00:08:37,862 --> 00:08:39,409
I'm Francesca's long lost son!

179
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:43,484
Right. Could you sign this?

180
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,249
No! No way! I'm not signing that!

181
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,374
I don't think that's gonna affect

182
00:08:49,374 --> 00:08:51,422
the plot of the show.

183
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,228
How can they do this to me?

184
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,500
I'm just gonna go.

185
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,400
Sorry.

186
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,306
Well, it wasn't that many guys.

187
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,878
If you consider

188
00:09:10,878 --> 00:09:15,285
how many guys there are it's a very small percentage.

189
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,838
It's not a big a deal.

190
00:09:16,838 --> 00:09:18,288
I was just curious.

191
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,341
Good night.

192
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:20,291
Good night.

193
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,294
Good luck, Mon.

194
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,408
Before I tell you, you tell me

195
00:09:24,408 --> 00:09:26,421
how many women you've been with.

196
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,425
Two.

197
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,238
Two? Two?

198
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,806
How is that possible?

199
00:09:35,806 --> 00:09:38,206
I mean, have you seen you?

200
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,304
Well, what can I say?

201
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,814
I was married to Barbara for 30 years,

202
00:09:43,814 --> 00:09:46,214
my high school sweetheart.

203
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,220
Now you. That's two.

204
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,445
Two it is.

205
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,820
Time for bed.

206
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,316
I'm gonna brush my teeth.

207
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,344
No, wait a minute now!

208
00:09:56,344 --> 00:09:58,261
Come on, it's your turn.

209
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,332
Oh, come on!

210
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,864
You know, I don't need the

211
00:10:03,864 --> 00:10:06,361
actual number. Just a ballpark.

212
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:07,956
Okay, it is definitely

213
00:10:07,956 --> 00:10:09,440
less than a ballpark.

214
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,813
I am so glad

215
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:17,246
I'm not Monica right now.

216
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,544
Tell me about it.

217
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,277
So what's your magic number?

218
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,857
Come on, you know everyone

219
00:10:26,857 --> 00:10:29,257
I've been with. All both of them.

220
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,488
Well, there's you.

221
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,300
Better not be doing these in order.

222
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,950
Billy Dreskin, Pete Carny,

223
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:43,400
Barry and oh, Paolo.

224
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,378
Oh, yes, the weenie from Turinie.

225
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,315
Honey, are you jealous of Paolo?

226
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,352
I'm so much happier with you

227
00:10:54,352 --> 00:10:56,286
than I ever was with him.

228
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,384
Really?

229
00:10:57,384 --> 00:10:58,379
Oh, please!

230
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,924
That Paolo thing was

231
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:01,357
barely a relationship.

232
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,395
All it really was just

233
00:11:03,395 --> 00:11:05,363
meaningless, animal sex.

234
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,983
Okay, you know, that sounded

235
00:11:11,983 --> 00:11:14,531
so much better in my head.

236
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,434
Eddie, I didn't sleep with her!

237
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:19,791
That's what someone

238
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,338
who slept with her would say.

239
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,864
This is nuts!

240
00:11:22,864 --> 00:11:27,248
She was over for two minutes dropped off a fish tank and left!

241
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:28,366
Where's Buddy?

242
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:29,446
Buddy?

243
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,388
My fish, Buddy.

244
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,854
There was no fish

245
00:11:33,854 --> 00:11:35,350
when she dropped it off.

246
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,390
This is unbelievable! First you sleep

247
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:41,433
with my ex-girlfriend insult me by lying,

248
00:11:41,433 --> 00:11:43,401
then you kill my fish, my Buddy?

249
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,465
I didn't kill your fish!

250
00:11:45,465 --> 00:11:47,461
Look, Eddie--

251
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,892
Would you look at what I'm doing here?

252
00:11:53,892 --> 00:11:56,474
Now that can't be smart.

253
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:01,502
So we're gonna take this guy right off

254
00:12:01,502 --> 00:12:04,420
you and put him here in Mr. Pocket.

255
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,223
Tangelo?

256
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,783
That's it? That's the number

257
00:12:18,783 --> 00:12:20,330
you were afraid to say?

258
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:21,889
Well, yeah.

259
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:23,339
That's not bad at all.

260
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,354
You had me thinking

261
00:12:25,354 --> 00:12:27,333
it was, like, a fleet.

262
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,863
You're really okay with it?

263
00:12:29,863 --> 00:12:32,280
Oh, honey, I'm fine.

264
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,378
Okay, about that two.

265
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,873
What?

266
00:12:39,873 --> 00:12:42,290
All right, what about my two?

267
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:43,811
It just seems like

268
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:45,261
a really small number.

269
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,561
Right. And...?

270
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,348
And, well, don't you have

271
00:12:50,348 --> 00:12:52,396
a lot of wild oats to sow?

272
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:54,888
Or is that what you're doing with me?

273
00:12:54,888 --> 00:12:57,305
Oh, my God! Am I an oat?

274
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,467
Honey, you are not an oat.

275
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,463
I don't know, I guess

276
00:13:01,463 --> 00:13:03,414
I'm just not an oat guy.

277
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,401
I've only slept with women I love.

278
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:09,353
But you've only slept with two people.

279
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,248
Right.

280
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:25,237
You know I love you too, right?

281
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,364
Now I do.

282
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:32,990
Ross! Ross, please listen to me!

283
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,537
Ross!

284
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,828
You are so much better

285
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:38,375
for me than Paolo ever was!

286
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,367
You care for me, you're loving,

287
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:42,250
you make me laugh.

288
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,768
If I make you laugh, here's an idea.

289
00:13:44,768 --> 00:13:49,424
Invite Paolo for a romp in the sack and I'll stand in the corner

290
00:13:49,424 --> 00:13:51,489
and tell knock-knock jokes!

291
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,296
What we have is special!

292
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,432
All Paolo and I had was--

293
00:13:57,432 --> 00:13:59,497
Animal sex? Animal sex?

294
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,820
So, what are you saying? There's

295
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,300
nothing between us ''animal'' at all?

296
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:09,364
There's not even, like,

297
00:14:09,364 --> 00:14:15,218
a little animal? Not even, like chipmunk sex?

298
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:20,358
Try to hear me, okay?

299
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,826
I'm not gonna lie to you.

300
00:14:22,826 --> 00:14:25,226
It was good with Paolo.

301
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,878
Knock-knock.

302
00:14:26,878 --> 00:14:28,425
But!

303
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,001
What you and I have

304
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:31,468
is so much better.

305
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:34,319
We have tenderness,

306
00:14:34,319 --> 00:14:36,367
we have intimacy, we connect.

307
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:43,475
You know? I swear this is the best I have ever had.

308
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,242
Until now.

309
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,876
Richard said he loved me.

310
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:57,292
Oh, my God!

311
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:58,830
I know!

312
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,297
Honey, that's great!

313
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,866
I can't find--

314
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:03,333
Top drawer. Hurry.

315
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,353
Why? You need one too?

316
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:07,304
Oh, yeah.

317
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,397
Found them!

318
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,209
There's only one.

319
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,316
We'll be right there.

320
00:15:20,316 --> 00:15:22,415
We're trying to decide something.

321
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,235
They're trying to decide something.

322
00:15:42,235 --> 00:15:44,231
Good. Good, good.

323
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,496
So was your mustache,

324
00:15:51,496 --> 00:15:53,544
did it used to be different?

325
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,481
No.

326
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:02,791
How do you, you know,

327
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:04,389
keep it so neat?

328
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,325
I have a little comb.

329
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,354
And what do you call that?

330
00:16:13,354 --> 00:16:15,305
A mustache comb.

331
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,372
Okay, I will do your laundry

332
00:16:18,372 --> 00:16:20,402
for one month.

333
00:16:20,512 --> 00:16:22,309
No!

334
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,882
I will, I will.... I will clean

335
00:16:24,882 --> 00:16:27,316
the apartment for two months.

336
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:30,320
I'll give this to you now, if you

337
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,221
tell me where we keep the dustpan.

338
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:43,333
So were you in Nam?

339
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,874
We are both adults here. Right? There

340
00:16:50,874 --> 00:16:54,275
has to be a mature way to handle this.

341
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,796
Rock, paper, scissors?

342
00:16:55,796 --> 00:16:57,246
Gotcha.

343
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,249
One, two, three.

344
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,285
Yes!

345
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,234
Fine. Go have sex.

346
00:17:04,234 --> 00:17:06,247
Thank you.

347
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,906
No! You have got it completely wrong!

348
00:17:08,906 --> 00:17:11,420
John Savage was Deer Hunter, no legs.

349
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,744
Jon Voight was Coming Home,

350
00:17:13,744 --> 00:17:15,291
couldn't feel his legs.

351
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,397
You've got it the other way

352
00:17:17,397 --> 00:17:19,393
around, my friend. Jon Voight--

353
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,217
Honey?

354
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:22,229
What?

355
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:31,378
Shall we?

356
00:17:31,378 --> 00:17:32,441
It's not gonna happen.

357
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,266
They're doing it tonight.

358
00:17:35,266 --> 00:17:37,314
We can do it tomorrow.

359
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,840
In the future, if I could see

360
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,223
the schedule beforehand....

361
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,845
When I woke up this morning, he'd

362
00:17:48,845 --> 00:17:51,359
stolen all the insoles out of my shoes!

363
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:52,461
Why?

364
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,234
He thinks I slept with his

365
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:57,230
ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.

366
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:59,471
Why would you kill his fish?

367
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:05,233
Because sometimes, after you sleep

368
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:08,185
with someone, you have to kill a fish.

369
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,323
Chandler, honey, I'm sorry.

370
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,791
Can we watch Joey's show now, please?

371
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:17,191
Wait. He's not here yet.

372
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:18,809
So? He's on the show.

373
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:20,322
He knows what happens.

374
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,366
I'm fine about my problem now,

375
00:18:22,366 --> 00:18:24,300
by the way.

376
00:18:26,338 --> 00:18:30,720
Amber I'll always be there for you,

377
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,200
as a friend and as your brother.

378
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,243
Oh, Drake.

379
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:37,779
Hard day, huh?

380
00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:39,343
First the medical award, now this?

381
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,914
Yeah. Some guys are

382
00:18:40,914 --> 00:18:42,410
just lucky, I guess.

383
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:46,271
Dr. Ramoray, report to

384
00:18:46,271 --> 00:18:48,319
first floor Emergency stat.

385
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:53,321
Well, then, I guess that's me.

386
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,833
Anyone else need to go on

387
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:00,199
the elevator? Dr. Horton? Dr. Wall?

388
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,297
They only said you.

389
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,277
Oh, okay. All right.

390
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,778
I love you, Drake.

391
00:19:08,778 --> 00:19:10,177
Yeah, whatever.

392
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,305
Oh, no!

393
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,181
Drake, look out!

394
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,789
Did they just kill off Joey?

395
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:21,188
No!

396
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,387
Now maybe.

397
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:27,894
Come on! Open up!

398
00:19:27,894 --> 00:19:29,390
We want to talk to you!

399
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:31,749
I don't feel like talking!

400
00:19:31,749 --> 00:19:33,296
We care about you.

401
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:35,822
We're worried about you.

402
00:19:35,822 --> 00:19:38,239
And some of us really have to pee!

403
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,205
I'm sorry, Joey.

404
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,334
Listen, sorry about your death.

405
00:19:47,334 --> 00:19:49,251
That really sucks.

406
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:51,354
We came when we saw.

407
00:19:51,354 --> 00:19:53,254
Why didn't you tell us?

408
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,822
I don't know. I was kind of hoping

409
00:19:55,822 --> 00:19:58,319
no one would find out.

410
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,297
Well, maybe they could find

411
00:20:00,297 --> 00:20:02,231
a way to bring you back.

412
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,834
They said when they found my body,

413
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:09,290
my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor who

414
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,241
could have saved me was me.

415
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,957
It's supposed to be

416
00:20:13,957 --> 00:20:15,470
some kind of irony.

417
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,382
You're gonna be fine. You don't need

418
00:20:19,382 --> 00:20:22,283
that show. It was a dumb soap opera.

419
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,867
It was the greatest thing

420
00:20:23,867 --> 00:20:25,380
that ever happened to me.

421
00:20:25,457 --> 00:20:29,393
Yes! I was going to incorporate that.

422
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:31,361
Here's Monica.

423
00:20:31,361 --> 00:20:33,261
She'll say something nice.

424
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,883
I straightened out your shower curtain

425
00:20:36,883 --> 00:20:39,300
so you won't get mildew.

426
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:42,363
What? To me, that's nice.

427
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,988
It'll be okay. You know that.

428
00:20:44,988 --> 00:20:47,502
No, I don't.

429
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,827
It's like you work

430
00:20:49,827 --> 00:20:53,934
your whole life for something and you think when you get it,

431
00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:56,385
it'll never be as good as you thought.

432
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,338
But this so was.

433
00:20:58,338 --> 00:21:00,255
It changed everything.

434
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:01,889
The other day, I got

435
00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:06,258
a credit card application and I was pre-approved!

436
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,333
I've never been pre-approved

437
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,233
for anything in my life!

438
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:13,463
I'm sorry, man.

439
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:15,786
I don't know if this'll mean

440
00:21:15,786 --> 00:21:19,393
anything to you but you'll always be

441
00:21:19,393 --> 00:21:21,344
pre-approved with us.

442
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,372
No, that means nothing to me.

443
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:33,347
Pecan sandy? Just made them.

444
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:35,492
Yeah, all right.

445
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,775
What are these, raisins?

446
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:40,288
Sure, why not?

447
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,406
Listen, Eddie.

448
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,860
I've been thinking about our living

449
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,311
situation. Why are you smiling?

450
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,431
I got a little surprise.

451
00:21:57,431 --> 00:21:59,382
Look. There's a new fishy.

452
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,414
I named him Chandler,

453
00:22:01,414 --> 00:22:03,410
you know, after you.

454
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:16,230
Well, that's not even a real fish.

455
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:20,234
No, that's a Goldfish cracker.

456
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,332
So what's your point, man?

457
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,440
Okay, good night.

458
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:32,348
You big freak of nature!

459
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:59,977
Brisk tonight.

460
00:22:59,977 --> 00:23:01,444
Oh, man.

461
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,710
Let's never speak of this.

462
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,206
You got it.
