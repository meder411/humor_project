1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,765
Chandler, Mon, there's only

2
00:00:03,765 --> 00:00:05,278
one muffin left.

3
00:00:05,355 --> 00:00:06,919
I ordered mine first.

4
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:08,483
Yeah, but I'm so much faster.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,372
Give it to me.

6
00:00:11,372 --> 00:00:12,384
No.

7
00:00:13,296 --> 00:00:15,264
Give it to me!

8
00:00:15,365 --> 00:00:17,458
Okay, you can have it.

9
00:00:24,574 --> 00:00:28,271
There you go. Enjoy your coffee.

10
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:31,279
That was there when I got here.

11
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:35,351
Hey, you'll never guess

12
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:37,285
who's coming to New York.

13
00:00:37,387 --> 00:00:39,378
Tell us before he can swallow.

14
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:40,939
Ryan, that guy I dated

15
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:42,389
who's in the Navy.

16
00:00:43,427 --> 00:00:45,418
You dated a guy in the Navy?

17
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:48,327
I met him while playing guitar.

18
00:00:48,432 --> 00:00:49,962
Ryan threw in saltwater taffy.

19
00:00:49,962 --> 00:00:51,492
He had no change.

20
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,849
Is that when you wrote

21
00:00:53,849 --> 00:00:55,396
''Saltwater Taffy Man''?

22
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,871
He's my submarine guy.

23
00:00:58,871 --> 00:01:02,341
He resurfaces every couple years and we have an amazing

24
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:03,438
three days together.

25
00:01:03,547 --> 00:01:05,964
Only, he's coming for two weeks.

26
00:01:05,964 --> 00:01:08,381
Two whole weeks, which means yea!

27
00:01:10,353 --> 00:01:12,401
So, wait, this guy goes down

28
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:14,449
for, like, two years at a time?

29
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,490
That'll teach you to lick my muffin.

30
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:25,264
Hi.

31
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,481
Oh, no. What happened?

32
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:29,460
Ben's got the chickenpox.

33
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:32,855
So if you haven't had it,

34
00:01:32,855 --> 00:01:34,402
chances are you will.

35
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:35,428
I've had it.

36
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,378
I've had it.

37
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,469
Had it.

38
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,465
I've never had it. I feel so left out.

39
00:01:39,465 --> 00:01:41,416
Oh, look!

40
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:37,372
Honey, you made the bed again.

41
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:38,987
You don't have to do that.

42
00:02:38,987 --> 00:02:40,500
This isn't camp.

43
00:02:41,278 --> 00:02:43,291
I guess the panty raid last night

44
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,304
was totally uncalled for.

45
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:48,847
Okay, I'm taking a shower. Today

46
00:02:48,847 --> 00:02:51,378
I'll sing Jim Croce's ''Leroy Brown.''

47
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,526
Hey, Mon, I have a question.

48
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,799
Is Leroy the baddest man

49
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,272
in the whole damn town or the fattest man?

50
00:03:12,342 --> 00:03:14,355
The baddest. Or the song

51
00:03:14,355 --> 00:03:16,368
would be ''Fat, Fat Leroy Brown.''

52
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:19,372
What are you doing?

53
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,275
I'm just waiting for you, sweetie.

54
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,446
Are you remaking the bed?

55
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:29,905
I'm sorry. The way you did it,

56
00:03:29,905 --> 00:03:31,452
it was just fine.

57
00:03:31,494 --> 00:03:34,292
Then you're redoing it because...?

58
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:36,298
You'll think I'm crazy.

59
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:37,913
You're pretty much

60
00:03:37,913 --> 00:03:39,460
running that risk either way.

61
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:45,357
Okay. You see the duvet tag shouldn't be

62
00:03:45,357 --> 00:03:48,827
at the top left corner it should be

63
00:03:48,827 --> 00:03:50,277
at the bottom right corner.

64
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,426
It's not crazy.

65
00:03:51,426 --> 00:03:52,472
I'm easing you in.

66
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,472
All right.

67
00:03:55,385 --> 00:03:57,433
You see these flower blossoms?

68
00:03:57,433 --> 00:04:02,253
They should be facing up, not down because the head of the bed

69
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:04,249
is where the sun would be.

70
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:10,265
You don't love me anymore, do you?

71
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:12,930
Actually, if it's possible,

72
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,426
I love you more.

73
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,532
Really?

74
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:20,334
Wow. Well, then, come on!

75
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:22,439
I wanna show you how to fold

76
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:24,435
the toilet paper into a point.

77
00:04:28,285 --> 00:04:31,837
Look, if you need something I can get you a job here

78
00:04:31,837 --> 00:04:33,287
as a processor.

79
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,307
Don't you need experience?

80
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:37,258
It's not hard to learn.

81
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:39,273
As far as not knowing

82
00:04:39,273 --> 00:04:41,252
what you're doing, you're an actor.

83
00:04:41,298 --> 00:04:43,380
Act like a processor,

84
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,462
people will think you're a processor.

85
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:48,369
Here's this morning's projections.

86
00:04:48,405 --> 00:04:49,838
Thanks.

87
00:04:49,838 --> 00:04:51,271
Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbiani.

88
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:54,307
Joey is a fellow processor.

89
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,274
No kidding?

90
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,414
Yeah.

91
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:01,984
I process. People want the processing,

92
00:05:01,984 --> 00:05:04,452
I'm the one they call.

93
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,768
Where do you work?

94
00:05:06,768 --> 00:05:08,315
Well, I'm in between things.

95
00:05:08,425 --> 00:05:10,325
You know, one day

96
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:14,321
you're processing, the next day not so much processing anymore.

97
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,358
I told Joey about Fleischman's group.

98
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:19,332
Fleischman's group?

99
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:21,387
Whatever you do,

100
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,338
don't touch his sandwiches.

101
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,233
Are all you processors dorks?

102
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:36,445
This lipstick looks just great on you.

103
00:05:37,387 --> 00:05:39,378
You look fabulous, really.

104
00:05:39,489 --> 00:05:42,356
Yeah, are you sure? Really?

105
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:46,345
See, you look beautiful.

106
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,296
For God's sakes, dim the lights.

107
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:51,364
I'm hideous!

108
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:53,265
It's gonna be okay.

109
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:54,463
Ryan's been underwater.

110
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,319
He's just gonna be so glad

111
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:59,367
you don't have barnacles on your butt.

112
00:06:11,321 --> 00:06:12,447
Come in.

113
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:15,220
Hey, baby, I'm back--

114
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:17,418
Hey, Ryan. What's up?

115
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,226
What's going on?

116
00:06:22,226 --> 00:06:24,222
No, no. You have to stay back.

117
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:25,426
I have the pox!

118
00:06:28,338 --> 00:06:30,431
Chicken or small?

119
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,889
Chicken, which is so ironic

120
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:35,238
considering I'm a vegetarian.

121
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,412
Why aren't you at home?

122
00:06:37,412 --> 00:06:39,346
My grandma's never had it.

123
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,366
Please tell me you have, because

124
00:06:42,366 --> 00:06:45,250
oh, my God, I forgot how cute you are.

125
00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:47,448
I'm sorry, I never had them.

126
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,426
If I had one wish,

127
00:06:51,426 --> 00:06:55,914
I'd go back to when I was 7 when Jimmy Hauser had chickenpox,

128
00:06:55,914 --> 00:06:58,365
and I'd rub him all over my face.

129
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:00,301
Yeah, or you could wish

130
00:07:00,301 --> 00:07:02,201
that I didn't have them now.

131
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:03,397
Can I see your face?

132
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:05,322
You don't wanna see a face

133
00:07:05,322 --> 00:07:06,437
covered with pox.

134
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,723
It could be covered with lox,

135
00:07:08,723 --> 00:07:10,236
I wouldn't care.

136
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:12,244
And you hate fish.

137
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:16,217
So sweet. All right.

138
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,344
Okay, all right. You can see.

139
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,255
This is me.

140
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:27,455
Sorry!

141
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:29,323
I am scary!

142
00:07:29,432 --> 00:07:31,428
Sorry, the lightning was

143
00:07:31,428 --> 00:07:33,424
an unfortunate coincidence.

144
00:07:34,337 --> 00:07:35,884
You look lovely! Lovely!

145
00:07:35,884 --> 00:07:37,431
I hate this.

146
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:39,804
I had the most amazing

147
00:07:39,804 --> 00:07:41,334
two weeks planned for us.

148
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:43,844
And everything I had in mind,

149
00:07:43,844 --> 00:07:46,244
we had to be closer than this.

150
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:48,934
Phoebe, I've spent the last eight

151
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:54,482
months in a steel tube with men thinking about this moment.

152
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:59,553
I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us.

153
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,835
Okay. This is the most

154
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:10,433
romantic disease I've ever had.

155
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,829
How's the first day?

156
00:08:18,829 --> 00:08:20,245
It's like you said.

157
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:22,364
It's mostly just putting numbers

158
00:08:22,364 --> 00:08:24,412
from one column into another.

159
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:27,320
Everybody's so nice. I just had

160
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,419
a good talk with that lady, Jeannie.

161
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:31,773
Jeannie? The head

162
00:08:31,773 --> 00:08:33,320
of East Coast operations?

163
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,879
Turns out our kids

164
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,329
go to the same school.

165
00:08:39,335 --> 00:08:41,326
Yeah. Small world, huh?

166
00:08:42,372 --> 00:08:44,340
Weird world.

167
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,840
Your kids?

168
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,240
I figure my character has kids.

169
00:08:49,512 --> 00:08:51,895
There isn't a part of that sentence

170
00:08:51,895 --> 00:08:54,278
I don't need explained.

171
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,846
In acting, you need

172
00:08:55,846 --> 00:08:57,342
to think about that stuff.

173
00:08:57,387 --> 00:08:58,900
My character, Joseph,

174
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,788
the processing guy has two little girls,

175
00:09:02,788 --> 00:09:04,386
Ashley and Brittany.

176
00:09:06,195 --> 00:09:07,742
Ashley copies everything

177
00:09:07,742 --> 00:09:09,289
Brittany does.

178
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:15,319
Well, invisible kids

179
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:17,202
can be that way sometimes.

180
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,971
You know, Joseph and his wife, Karen,

181
00:09:19,971 --> 00:09:22,502
are thinking of having a third kid.

182
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,247
You know what?

183
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,249
Just did.

184
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:30,714
Wow, that's some pretty powerful

185
00:09:30,714 --> 00:09:33,211
imaginary sperm you must have there.

186
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:46,781
Know what makes the itching worse?

187
00:09:46,781 --> 00:09:49,329
That you don't stop talking about it?

188
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:51,302
Fine.

189
00:09:51,302 --> 00:09:52,331
Let's just play, okay?

190
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:56,439
Good, okay. Here we go, double sixes.

191
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,243
Here we go....

192
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,801
Here we go. Come to Mama. Just getting

193
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:05,252
ready to roll the dice....

194
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,852
What're you doing? Are you scratching?

195
00:10:07,852 --> 00:10:10,349
No. This is what I do for luck, okay?

196
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:12,911
You're scratching. Give me the dice.

197
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:14,361
No.

198
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:15,830
Give me the dice.

199
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,263
No! Here. There!

200
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,459
Look, double sixes!

201
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,395
We can't scratch. We'll scar.

202
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:24,870
I can't stop thinking about it.

203
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,468
It's just so hard.

204
00:10:27,276 --> 00:10:28,823
I wanna grab these houses

205
00:10:28,823 --> 00:10:30,370
and rub them on my body.

206
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,947
No!

207
00:10:31,947 --> 00:10:33,414
Give it! Yeah, come on!

208
00:10:33,516 --> 00:10:34,966
You know you want it too.

209
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:36,416
Come on.

210
00:10:36,486 --> 00:10:37,902
Let's just be bad.

211
00:10:37,902 --> 00:10:39,318
It'll feel so good.

212
00:10:39,422 --> 00:10:40,514
Come on.

213
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:44,293
Oh, God help me.

214
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:46,909
Oh, yeah.

215
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:47,523
Good. Now do me.

216
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:49,412
Do my back.

217
00:10:49,412 --> 00:10:50,527
Oh, come on. Harder!

218
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:52,329
There you go. Don't move.

219
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:53,324
Why?

220
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,870
Don't move.

221
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,337
What are you...?

222
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:02,275
Stop that! Stop that right now.

223
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:04,910
I might've expected this of Phoebe.

224
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:07,475
But, Ryan, you're a military man.

225
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:11,343
She made me do it.

226
00:11:11,387 --> 00:11:13,355
That's a nice color on you.

227
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:14,969
Yeah, well, it comes in pink

228
00:11:14,969 --> 00:11:16,482
and blotchy, baby.

229
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,295
I hope you get a weenie pock.

230
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:25,317
You and Milton have to join us

231
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:27,268
on the boat.

232
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,418
We'll make a day of it.

233
00:11:29,418 --> 00:11:31,466
That sounds lovely. We'll set it up.

234
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:33,390
I better get back.

235
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,273
Hope the baby feels better.

236
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:36,909
Thanks. Bye-bye, Jeannie.

237
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:38,507
Bye-bye, Joseph.

238
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:41,279
What a phony.

239
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,403
You'll teach her a lesson when she

240
00:11:46,403 --> 00:11:48,519
steps off the dock onto nothing.

241
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:49,922
Hey, Mr. Douglas.

242
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:50,519
Sir.

243
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:53,375
Bing, I got your memo. We won't

244
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,423
see the report till next Friday?

245
00:11:55,498 --> 00:11:58,416
My group wants the weekend for family.

246
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,334
I have a family. I'm gonna be here.

247
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:05,237
Yeah, Bing. What's that about?

248
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:09,940
It's about cutting people

249
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,436
slack for morale.

250
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:13,363
I can get some rough numbers

251
00:12:13,363 --> 00:12:14,478
by Wednesday.

252
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:17,344
Rough numbers?

253
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:20,317
This company wasn't built

254
00:12:20,317 --> 00:12:22,347
on rough numbers. Right, Mr. Douglas?

255
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:23,976
Have the final numbers

256
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,460
on my desk by Tuesday.

257
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:28,359
If you say so, sir.

258
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:31,365
Joseph's good, isn't he?

259
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:34,395
I'm going to kill you.

260
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:37,888
Hey, I figure Joseph's the kind of guy

261
00:12:37,888 --> 00:12:40,305
who likes to mix it up.

262
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:41,923
You know, get in there,

263
00:12:41,923 --> 00:12:43,470
ruffle some feathers.

264
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,311
Why?

265
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:49,882
Look, I'm sorry,

266
00:12:49,882 --> 00:12:51,480
but that's what Joseph does.

267
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,921
Okay? If you try to pull something,

268
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:56,321
he'll call you on it.

269
00:12:56,392 --> 00:12:57,489
''What're you trying to pull?''

270
00:12:57,489 --> 00:12:58,586
he'll say.

271
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:05,229
Duct tape.

272
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:08,426
Was I supposed to bring something too?

273
00:13:09,272 --> 00:13:11,354
This is for the scratchy twins.

274
00:13:11,354 --> 00:13:13,436
I taped oven mitts to their hands.

275
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:15,858
You're strict.

276
00:13:15,858 --> 00:13:17,439
Well, it's for their own good.

277
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,998
You know, I like the way you have

278
00:13:19,998 --> 00:13:22,449
efficiently folded this tab under.

279
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:25,369
See, in a tape emergency you could

280
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:28,253
shave valuable seconds off your time.

281
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,359
Exactly!

282
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:32,893
God, I love that I can be

283
00:13:32,893 --> 00:13:35,293
totally neurotic around you now.

284
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,832
Don't you like it better with

285
00:13:37,832 --> 00:13:40,266
everything on your desk perpendicular?

286
00:13:40,303 --> 00:13:41,833
If it's not a right angle,

287
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,363
it is a wrong angle.

288
00:13:44,373 --> 00:13:45,385
Very good.

289
00:13:45,385 --> 00:13:46,397
Thank you.

290
00:13:46,475 --> 00:13:49,273
Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.

291
00:13:49,378 --> 00:13:50,942
You're gonna do what to them?

292
00:13:50,942 --> 00:13:52,506
Set them to my time.

293
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,352
I'm confused.

294
00:13:57,352 --> 00:13:59,286
I thought we shared time.

295
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:02,423
No. See, in my bedroom, I set my clock

296
00:14:02,423 --> 00:14:05,324
six minutes fast. Know why?

297
00:14:05,361 --> 00:14:07,795
Because it's in a slightly different

298
00:14:07,795 --> 00:14:10,229
time zone than the kitchen?

299
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,379
Forget it.

300
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:12,425
No, come on, tell me.

301
00:14:13,236 --> 00:14:15,232
You don't understand. You don't

302
00:14:15,232 --> 00:14:17,228
have any of these obsessions.

303
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,240
No, that's not true.

304
00:14:19,342 --> 00:14:21,333
Oh, yeah? Tell me one of yours.

305
00:14:22,345 --> 00:14:23,471
Okay.

306
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,416
One of my things is,

307
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:36,281
I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks.

308
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,861
What if they get mixed up?

309
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:43,261
Boy, I would just....

310
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:45,357
I would freak out.

311
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,300
You would not.

312
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:50,338
I can't believe this.

313
00:14:50,338 --> 00:14:52,272
I hate this. You're too normal.

314
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:54,826
I can't believe you don't have a thing.

315
00:14:54,826 --> 00:14:57,277
My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.

316
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,359
See, if anyone overheard that,

317
00:14:59,359 --> 00:15:01,338
I didn't come off well there.

318
00:15:07,223 --> 00:15:08,315
Hey!

319
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,938
Mr. Douglas is looking for you.

320
00:15:11,938 --> 00:15:14,418
Why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?

321
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,344
He has a suspicion you dropped

322
00:15:17,344 --> 00:15:19,357
the ball on the Lender project.

323
00:15:19,435 --> 00:15:22,336
Why? Why does he suspect that?

324
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,836
At first, he thought it was Joseph.

325
00:15:25,836 --> 00:15:28,333
But after he asked Joseph about it....

326
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:30,435
Turns out it was you.

327
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,314
I thought you should know.

328
00:15:33,314 --> 00:15:35,248
All right. That's it!

329
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:37,332
Look, Joey, I realize this

330
00:15:37,332 --> 00:15:41,871
is the role of a lifetime for you and if I could just fire Joseph,

331
00:15:41,871 --> 00:15:44,254
I would. But that's not possible.

332
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,810
So I'm gonna have to let

333
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,260
both of you go.

334
00:15:48,264 --> 00:15:50,277
What? Everybody loves Joseph.

335
00:15:50,277 --> 00:15:52,290
I don't. I hate Joseph.

336
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:55,463
I think he's a brownnosing suck-up.

337
00:15:57,273 --> 00:15:59,303
Oh, yeah? Well, you can't fire Joseph.

338
00:15:59,303 --> 00:16:01,333
He's not in your department.

339
00:16:06,415 --> 00:16:08,315
All right, okay.

340
00:16:08,315 --> 00:16:13,220
So I can't fire Joseph but I can sleep with his wife.

341
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:16,347
Not Karen!

342
00:16:16,425 --> 00:16:18,342
Yeah, I'm thinking about

343
00:16:18,342 --> 00:16:20,259
having an affair with her.

344
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:22,263
You know what?

345
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:24,231
I just did.

346
00:16:26,469 --> 00:16:28,352
What the hell are you doing?

347
00:16:28,352 --> 00:16:30,235
Oh, it's not me.

348
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:32,239
It's my character!

349
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,240
Chandie.

350
00:16:34,477 --> 00:16:36,411
The rogue processor who seduces

351
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:40,349
his coworkers' wives and then laughs about it.

352
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:42,349
I have her panties

353
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:44,249
right there in my drawer!

354
00:16:44,353 --> 00:16:45,399
Really?

355
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:46,445
No, freak! She's fictional!

356
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,349
All right. Hey, take it easy.

357
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,307
If it means that much to you,

358
00:16:52,307 --> 00:16:54,355
I'll go find something else.

359
00:16:55,364 --> 00:16:56,490
Thank you.

360
00:16:58,467 --> 00:17:02,335
It's just that I'm gonna miss Joseph.

361
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,429
I liked him. His wife?

362
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:07,232
She was hot.

363
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,761
And the kids. You know he was gonna

364
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:13,212
put in a pool next summer.

365
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,885
Take these off.

366
00:17:17,885 --> 00:17:19,318
I swear I won't scratch.

367
00:17:19,422 --> 00:17:22,220
No, sorry, hon. Monica's orders.

368
00:17:24,226 --> 00:17:26,319
Well, that wasn't easy.

369
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,423
Okay, dinner's on.

370
00:17:30,232 --> 00:17:31,278
There's a peach cobbler

371
00:17:31,278 --> 00:17:32,324
in the oven.

372
00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:34,852
So the plate's gonna be hot, but that

373
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:37,269
shouldn't be a problem for you.

374
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:40,265
All right, you kids. Bye, now.

375
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:41,326
Bye.

376
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,310
Oh, look.

377
00:17:42,378 --> 00:17:44,312
A low-budget puppet show.

378
00:17:46,382 --> 00:17:48,333
It's a shame you can't see

379
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,284
what finger I'm holding up.

380
00:17:54,256 --> 00:17:55,353
Wine?

381
00:17:55,353 --> 00:17:56,450
Please.

382
00:18:06,202 --> 00:18:07,299
Spilled some.

383
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:08,396
I got it.

384
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:21,313
I must say,

385
00:18:21,313 --> 00:18:22,410
you look beautiful tonight.

386
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:24,316
What?

387
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:27,218
Sorry.

388
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:31,325
You look beautiful.

389
00:18:47,443 --> 00:18:50,378
Okay. You know what? That's it.

390
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,479
Oh, yes.

391
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,187
Good.

392
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,322
You guys, did you--?

393
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:21,333
Monica, wake up.

394
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:23,928
What's up?

395
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:25,412
I thought of a thing.

396
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,281
Yeah?

397
00:19:31,281 --> 00:19:32,310
Yeah.

398
00:19:32,454 --> 00:19:34,888
I have to sleep, have to,

399
00:19:34,888 --> 00:19:37,322
on this side of the bed.

400
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,343
No. You have to sleep

401
00:19:40,343 --> 00:19:44,299
on this side of the bed because I have to sleep

402
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:46,267
on this side of the bed.

403
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:50,336
Or so I would have you believe.

404
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,454
So you have a side of the bed.

405
00:19:54,454 --> 00:19:56,467
Everybody has a side of the bed.

406
00:19:57,246 --> 00:19:58,343
Come on. You haven't

407
00:19:58,343 --> 00:19:59,440
heard my reason yet.

408
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,766
All right, go on.

409
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:03,250
Okay.

410
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:08,752
I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California,

411
00:20:08,752 --> 00:20:12,907
and otherwise the ocean would be

412
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:14,454
on the wrong side.

413
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,393
Oh, my God.

414
00:20:20,502 --> 00:20:21,986
You're a freak!

415
00:20:21,986 --> 00:20:23,470
Yeah.

416
00:20:23,505 --> 00:20:25,473
How about that?

417
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,991
Where are you shipping off to?

418
00:20:30,991 --> 00:20:32,504
I can't say.

419
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:35,278
Do you have nuclear weapons onboard?

420
00:20:35,278 --> 00:20:37,274
I can't say.

421
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:38,836
Do you get to look

422
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:40,286
through a periscope?

423
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:42,323
I'm sorry, but I can't say.

424
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:43,887
Wow, it's neat learning

425
00:20:43,887 --> 00:20:45,383
about submarines.

426
00:20:46,295 --> 00:20:47,791
I better get out of here.

427
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:49,287
I'll walk you out.

428
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,878
Bye, Ryan.

429
00:20:50,878 --> 00:20:52,425
A pleasure. Take care.

430
00:20:57,406 --> 00:20:59,886
So do you think we could get you

431
00:20:59,886 --> 00:21:02,366
one of those uniform things?

432
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:04,741
You like that, do you?

433
00:21:04,741 --> 00:21:06,237
Oh, yeah.

434
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,844
I'll make some calls.

435
00:21:07,844 --> 00:21:09,340
Okay.

436
00:21:10,252 --> 00:21:12,351
Can you believe how we spent our time?

437
00:21:12,351 --> 00:21:16,941
We didn't do anything I planned like having a picnic in Central Park

438
00:21:16,941 --> 00:21:19,392
and coffee at Central Perk.

439
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:22,259
Oh, I just got that!

440
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:32,269
Taxi!

441
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,406
Bye, you.

442
00:21:52,494 --> 00:21:54,291
I'm sorry, we're clo--

443
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,866
Hey, sailor.

444
00:21:58,866 --> 00:22:00,333
Is this what you had in mind?

445
00:22:02,271 --> 00:22:03,431
I'll say.

446
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:11,337
I'm shipping out tomorrow.

447
00:22:11,447 --> 00:22:17,480
Well, then...we better make this night count.

448
00:22:19,388 --> 00:22:20,918
Wait, I forgot to turn off

449
00:22:20,918 --> 00:22:22,448
the cappuccino machine.

450
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,291
Anchors aweigh.

451
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:35,986
Oh, wait, wait!

452
00:22:35,986 --> 00:22:37,402
My purse, my purse!

453
00:22:43,412 --> 00:22:46,279
Oh, I forgot to turn off the light.

454
00:22:46,315 --> 00:22:49,307
Why don't I just meet you upstairs?

455
00:22:53,389 --> 00:22:55,323
Honey!
