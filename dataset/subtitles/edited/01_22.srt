1
00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:02,352
Tell him.

2
00:00:02,352 --> 00:00:03,336
Tell him.

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,399
Shut up.

4
00:00:04,399 --> 00:00:05,428
Tell me what?

5
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:07,335
You won't look at him.

6
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:09,353
I could use another

7
00:00:09,353 --> 00:00:11,332
reason why women won't look at me.

8
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:13,861
All right. All right.

9
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:18,442
Last night, I had a dream that you and I were--

10
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:21,447
Doing it on this table.

11
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:25,486
Excellent dream score.

12
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,364
Why would you dream that?

13
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,491
More importantly was I any good?

14
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,565
Well, you were pretty damn good.

15
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,421
Interesting. In my dreams,

16
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:44,469
I'm surprisingly inadequate.

17
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,508
Last night, you seemed to know

18
00:00:47,508 --> 00:00:49,504
your way around the table.

19
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:55,315
I love it when we share.

20
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:00,314
You okay?

21
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,294
I can't believe you two

22
00:01:02,294 --> 00:01:04,228
had sex in her dream.

23
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,265
Sorry, it was a one-time thing.

24
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:08,414
I was very drunk, and it was

25
00:01:08,414 --> 00:01:10,462
someone else's subconscious.

26
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,242
Hello, Rachel.

27
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,251
Get off.

28
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,858
Ooh, give me. Can you see me

29
00:02:07,858 --> 00:02:10,258
operating a drill press?

30
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:11,813
I don't know.

31
00:02:11,813 --> 00:02:13,263
What are you wearing?

32
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,237
Why would you want to?

33
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,307
For short-term work. Till I get

34
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,275
back my massage clients.

35
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,243
Pirates again?

36
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:28,243
No. Nothing like that.

37
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,373
I'm just such a dummy.

38
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,964
I taught a ''Massage Yourself at Home''

39
00:02:32,964 --> 00:02:35,478
workshop. And they are.

40
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:39,391
Hey, Chan, she could work for you.

41
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,292
Thanks, Joey. That's a good idea.

42
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:45,364
I could. I could do it. What is it?

43
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,962
My secretary's gonna be out.

44
00:02:47,962 --> 00:02:50,459
She's having one of her boobs reduced.

45
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,466
It's a whole big boob story.

46
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,973
I could be a secretary.

47
00:02:55,973 --> 00:03:00,912
I don't know if it'd be your thing because it involves being

48
00:03:00,912 --> 00:03:03,346
normal for a large portion of the day.

49
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,416
I could do that.

50
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:08,282
What's that?

51
00:03:08,282 --> 00:03:09,311
My new beeper.

52
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,788
Why does a paleontologist

53
00:03:10,788 --> 00:03:12,221
need a beeper?

54
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,822
Is it for dinosaur emergencies?

55
00:03:14,822 --> 00:03:17,319
Help. They're still extinct.

56
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:21,331
It's for when Carol goes into labor.

57
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:25,269
All she has to do is dial 55-JlMBO.

58
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,786
A cool number and

59
00:03:27,786 --> 00:03:29,333
a possible name for the kid.

60
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:30,892
See you later.

61
00:03:30,892 --> 00:03:32,342
Off to see young Ethan?

62
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,275
Thank you.

63
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,345
How young is young Ethan?

64
00:03:36,345 --> 00:03:37,442
Young?

65
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,476
He's our age.

66
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:42,447
When we were....

67
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,888
He's a senior in college.

68
00:03:47,888 --> 00:03:49,384
College?

69
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,297
Rob that cradle.

70
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,462
He's smart and mature and grown-up.

71
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,297
Mature and grown-up, he's a big boy.

72
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,758
This man-child has no problem

73
00:04:03,758 --> 00:04:05,208
with how old you are?

74
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,841
No, of course not.

75
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:10,348
It's not even an issue because I said I was 22.

76
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,314
You what?

77
00:04:11,314 --> 00:04:12,212
What?

78
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,865
Oh, I can't pass for 22?

79
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:15,412
Well, maybe 25, 26.

80
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:17,319
I am 26.

81
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,416
There you go.

82
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,339
Can you hear that?

83
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,824
That'll stop

84
00:04:38,824 --> 00:04:40,371
when you pick up the phone.

85
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,311
Oh, I'm on.

86
00:04:43,311 --> 00:04:44,374
Okay.

87
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,345
Mr. Bing's office.

88
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,352
Sorry, he's in a meeting.

89
00:04:52,352 --> 00:04:54,348
I'm not in a meeting.

90
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,910
Will he know what

91
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,360
this is in reference to?

92
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,294
And he has your number?

93
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,282
I'll see that he gets

94
00:05:01,282 --> 00:05:03,199
the message. Bye-bye.

95
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,396
Ross says hi.

96
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,338
This is so fun.

97
00:05:09,338 --> 00:05:10,435
What do we do now?

98
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,325
Well, now I actually

99
00:05:12,325 --> 00:05:13,440
have to get to work.

100
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,407
''Most likely.''

101
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,511
Okay, I'm gonna be out there.

102
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,256
All right. Bye-bye.

103
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,450
Bye-bye.

104
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:32,848
Yes?

105
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:34,332
-What you doing?

106
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,984
Okay, windows are clean.

107
00:05:38,984 --> 00:05:40,531
Candles are lit.

108
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:42,320
Belt's too tight.

109
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,366
Gotta change.

110
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,456
Did I turn the fish?

111
00:05:45,456 --> 00:05:47,469
Nope, because I made lasagna.

112
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,895
Am I out of control?

113
00:05:49,895 --> 00:05:51,442
Just a touch.

114
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,303
I don't understand.

115
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:58,347
You've been dating this guy since his midterms.

116
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,907
Why, all of a sudden,

117
00:05:59,907 --> 00:06:01,323
are you so...?

118
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,749
What?

119
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:10,200
Could tonight be the night?

120
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:16,323
I don't know. He's a great guy and I love being with him.

121
00:06:16,323 --> 00:06:20,392
But, you know things happen when they happen.

122
00:06:20,392 --> 00:06:22,440
You don't plan these things.

123
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,866
So, did you shave your legs?

124
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:26,316
Yeah.

125
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:31,852
Would you let it go?

126
00:06:31,852 --> 00:06:33,348
It was just a dream.

127
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,257
It doesn't mean--

128
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,355
This is it. It's baby time!

129
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:40,898
All right, relax. Just relax.

130
00:06:40,898 --> 00:06:42,331
Be cool.

131
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,337
Yeah, hi. I was just beeped.

132
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,356
No, Andre is not here.

133
00:06:50,356 --> 00:06:52,438
Third time today.

134
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,439
Yes, I am sure.

135
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,448
I do not perform

136
00:06:57,448 --> 00:06:59,348
those kind of services.

137
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,182
Services?

138
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,276
Oh, services.

139
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:06,214
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO.

140
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:11,388
That's right.

141
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,993
That's right.

142
00:07:12,993 --> 00:07:14,489
JUMBO with a ''U,'' sir.

143
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:16,394
You don't want me.

144
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,818
Judging by his number,

145
00:07:18,818 --> 00:07:20,433
I'd be a huge disappointment.

146
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,332
Alrighty, bye-bye.

147
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,213
How was the first day?

148
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:30,862
Excellent.

149
00:07:30,862 --> 00:07:32,409
Everyone was so, so nice.

150
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:34,469
It pays to know the man

151
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:36,420
who wears my shoes.

152
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,315
Me.

153
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,892
I didn't tell anyone I knew you.

154
00:07:40,892 --> 00:07:42,325
Why?

155
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,328
Well, because, you know.

156
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,457
They don't like you.

157
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:51,431
What?

158
00:07:51,431 --> 00:07:52,426
I thought you knew.

159
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:56,959
Who doesn't like me?

160
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,443
Everyone.

161
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,371
Except for....

162
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,306
No. Everyone.

163
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:06,780
What are you talking about?

164
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,276
Don't feel bad.

165
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,378
They used to like you a lot.

166
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,289
But you got promoted, and now you're

167
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:15,388
Mr. Boss Man. Mr. Big.

168
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,390
Mr. Bing. Boss Man Bing.

169
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:21,846
I can't believe it.

170
00:08:21,846 --> 00:08:23,393
Yeah. They even do you.

171
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,238
They ''do'' me?

172
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,205
You know, like, okay:

173
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,302
''Could that report be any later?''

174
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:39,314
I don't sound like that.

175
00:08:39,314 --> 00:08:40,411
Yeah, you do.

176
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:43,871
''The hills are alive

177
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:47,425
with the sound of music.''

178
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:56,267
''My scone. My scone.''

179
00:08:58,337 --> 00:08:59,867
I don't sound like that.

180
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:01,397
That is so not true.

181
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:04,790
That is so not--

182
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,404
That is so not--

183
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,207
That--

184
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:08,202
Oh, shut up.

185
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:13,247
Did not.

186
00:09:13,247 --> 00:09:16,354
Up until I was 9 I thought ''gunpoint'' was

187
00:09:16,354 --> 00:09:18,288
a place where crimes happened.

188
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,820
How's that possible?

189
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,316
It's always on the news.

190
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,295
''A man is being held up at Gunpoint.''

191
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,376
''Tourists are terrorized

192
00:09:25,376 --> 00:09:26,422
at Gunpoint.''

193
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,348
And I kept thinking,

194
00:09:29,348 --> 00:09:31,396
''Why do people continue to go there?''

195
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,301
I should go.

196
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,287
Unless--

197
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,254
What?

198
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,348
Unless you wanna stay over.

199
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,325
I mean, I'm going to. So....

200
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,321
Yeah, I'd really like that.

201
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,487
Before we get into any

202
00:10:08,487 --> 00:10:13,438
staying-over stuff there's something you should know.

203
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,362
Is this, like,

204
00:10:15,362 --> 00:10:18,800
''I have an early class tomorrow'' or ''I'm secretly married

205
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,250
to a goat''?

206
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:24,254
Well, it's somewhere in between.

207
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,370
You see, in a strictly technical

208
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,383
sense, of course, I'm not....

209
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,453
Well, I mean, I haven't ever....

210
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,294
Ethan?

211
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,262
Are you a virgin?

212
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:37,397
If that's what you kids are

213
00:10:37,397 --> 00:10:42,269
calling it these days, then yes, I am.

214
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,375
I mean, you're just such a good kisser

215
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,474
I would never have known.

216
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,380
Well, I've excelled at every level

217
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,479
I've been to, I just....

218
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:57,500
I just haven't been to

219
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,479
that particular one yet.

220
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,307
I've kind of been waiting

221
00:11:02,307 --> 00:11:04,355
for the right person.

222
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,846
Really?

223
00:11:05,846 --> 00:11:07,262
Yeah.

224
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,898
You do know I was talking

225
00:11:09,898 --> 00:11:11,462
about you, right?

226
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,275
Wow.

227
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,474
You keep saying that.

228
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:25,964
You know, you read about it.

229
00:11:25,964 --> 00:11:27,545
You see it in the movies.

230
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:29,868
Even when you practice it at home,

231
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:34,452
man, oh, man it is nothing like that.

232
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,296
Listen, listen.

233
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,348
You told me something

234
00:11:43,348 --> 00:11:45,396
that was really difficult for you.

235
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,484
And I figure if you can

236
00:11:47,484 --> 00:11:49,497
be honest, then I can too.

237
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,377
Don't tell me I did it wrong.

238
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,472
Nothing wrong about that.

239
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,412
Here goes.

240
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,224
I'm not 22.

241
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:11,353
I'm 25...and 13 months.

242
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,350
But I figure that shouldn't

243
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,267
change anything.

244
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,834
What does it matter how old we are?

245
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:23,331
Basically, I'm nuts about you.

246
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,855
I knew after the first time we kissed.

247
00:12:25,855 --> 00:12:28,335
You didn't mention the Tic Tac.

248
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:29,943
I just thought

249
00:12:29,943 --> 00:12:31,439
you were naturally minty.

250
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:38,852
Listen as long as we're

251
00:12:38,852 --> 00:12:43,385
telling stuff...I have another one for you.

252
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:47,389
I'm a little younger than I said.

253
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,418
You're not a senior?

254
00:12:50,418 --> 00:12:58,366
Oh, I'm a senior...in high school.

255
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,223
What we did was wrong.

256
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,788
I just had sex with someone who

257
00:13:13,788 --> 00:13:16,319
wasn't alive during the bicentennial.

258
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,528
I just had sex.

259
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:24,882
Ethan, focus.

260
00:13:24,882 --> 00:13:26,429
How could you not tell me?

261
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,905
You never said your age.

262
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:29,338
It's different.

263
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:31,454
My lie didn't make one of us

264
00:13:31,454 --> 00:13:33,467
a felon in 48 states.

265
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,910
What were you thinking?

266
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,440
I was too busy falling--

267
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,383
Don't say it.

268
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:41,283
In love with you.

269
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:42,852
Really?

270
00:13:42,852 --> 00:13:44,251
Sorry.

271
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,288
Well, fall out of it.

272
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:48,974
You shouldn't be here.

273
00:13:48,974 --> 00:13:50,555
It's a school night.

274
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,466
Oh, God.

275
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,279
I'm like those women

276
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,496
that you see with shiny guys named Chad.

277
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,302
I'm Joan Collins.

278
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,407
Who?

279
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:19,356
Andre should be there

280
00:14:19,356 --> 00:14:21,256
in about 45 minutes.

281
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:28,222
Yes, sir, the kimonos are extra.

282
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,425
Alrighty. Bye-bye.

283
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,240
It's just easier that way.

284
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,858
You told me about the last dream.

285
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:41,241
No. Forget it.

286
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,315
Why not? Was I doing

287
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,283
something particularly saucy?

288
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,479
All right. Fine.

289
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,448
You were not the only one there.

290
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,351
Joey was there too.

291
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,360
All right.

292
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:08,234
Was there...anybody else there?

293
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:14,406
You sure? Nobody handing out mints or anything?

294
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,350
No, it was just the three of us.

295
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,886
So was it you and Chandler then you and me,

296
00:15:24,886 --> 00:15:26,450
or you, me and Chandler?

297
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,289
You know what?

298
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:30,318
What?

299
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:35,324
There were times when it wasn't even me.

300
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,338
That is so sweet, you guys.

301
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,352
Mon, Ethan called again.

302
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:04,241
What?

303
00:16:04,241 --> 00:16:05,287
Ethan called again.

304
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:07,894
You're not seeing him anymore?

305
00:16:07,894 --> 00:16:09,390
No.

306
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,295
Sometimes, things don't work out.

307
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,918
This has nothing to do with him

308
00:16:14,918 --> 00:16:17,432
needing a note to get out of gym?

309
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:23,404
I did not say anything. I swear.

310
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,766
He stopped by.

311
00:16:25,766 --> 00:16:29,332
Next time you talk to him could you ask him which one

312
00:16:29,332 --> 00:16:31,345
the strongest Power Ranger is?

313
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,276
Oh, my life is just so amusing.

314
00:16:35,276 --> 00:16:37,227
Can we drop it now?

315
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,421
Sorry.

316
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,457
''It's morphin' time.''

317
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,382
Stegosaurus.

318
00:16:42,382 --> 00:16:43,531
Tyrannosaurus.

319
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,332
I gotta go.

320
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,270
Head rush.

321
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,246
One more, and then I have to go.

322
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,440
Cool.

323
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,414
Where you going?

324
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,302
A birthday party

325
00:17:04,302 --> 00:17:05,382
with some work people.

326
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,388
Work people? Nobody told me.

327
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:10,860
I know.

328
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,844
That's part of the whole them-not-liking-you

329
00:17:13,844 --> 00:17:15,391
extravaganza.

330
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:17,969
A month ago,

331
00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:19,436
these people were my friends.

332
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,735
I'm in charge,

333
00:17:21,735 --> 00:17:23,231
but I'm not a different person.

334
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,822
Then come, hang out. Let them see

335
00:17:25,822 --> 00:17:28,302
what a great guy you still are.

336
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,376
You think I should?

337
00:17:29,376 --> 00:17:30,405
I really do.

338
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,318
But could we not go together?

339
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,836
I don't wanna be the geek

340
00:17:37,836 --> 00:17:39,417
who invited the boss.

341
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,862
Hey, you okay?

342
00:17:44,862 --> 00:17:46,295
Yeah.

343
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,849
This can't be easy for him either.

344
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:51,266
I know.

345
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,366
This may take some time

346
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:57,425
for him to get over it but, then at four,

347
00:17:57,425 --> 00:17:59,376
Muppet Babies is on.

348
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:10,219
Go deep. Deep. Deep.

349
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,418
Sorry, Shelly.

350
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,185
See, with the fun?

351
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,194
Last night was great.

352
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,250
The karaoke thing?

353
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,201
Tracy and I doing ''Ebony and Ivory.''

354
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:25,816
You were great.

355
00:18:25,816 --> 00:18:27,329
But they still made fun of you.

356
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,872
What?

357
00:18:28,872 --> 00:18:30,305
Now you're Mr. Caring Boss.

358
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,240
Mr. I'm-one-of-you Boss.

359
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,861
Mr. I-wanna-be-your-buddy

360
00:18:33,861 --> 00:18:35,311
Boss Man Bing.

361
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,213
Then I don't get it.

362
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:41,302
You know what?

363
00:18:41,302 --> 00:18:43,253
I think you just gotta face it.

364
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,448
You're the guy in the big office.

365
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,390
You're the one that hires

366
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,522
and fires them.

367
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,358
They say you're a great boss.

368
00:18:50,358 --> 00:18:51,455
They do?

369
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,295
But they're not

370
00:18:54,295 --> 00:18:55,358
your friends anymore.

371
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,917
I just want--

372
00:18:56,917 --> 00:18:58,367
But you can't.

373
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,404
But I just want--

374
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:11,371
Are you gonna--?

375
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,782
Carol and I have a new system.

376
00:19:13,782 --> 00:19:17,735
If she punches in 9-1
-1  she's having a baby.

377
00:19:17,735 --> 00:19:19,282
Otherwise, I just ignore it.

378
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:20,415
What about Andre?

379
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,689
He got a call

380
00:19:22,689 --> 00:19:24,185
from our cousin, Nathan.

381
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,264
Frankly, it was a little more

382
00:19:26,264 --> 00:19:28,232
than I needed to know.

383
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,433
That was gonna be my opener.

384
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,278
Have you guys seen those

385
00:19:40,278 --> 00:19:42,246
new hand dryers in the bathroom?

386
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:43,927
I thought that was just a rumor.

387
00:19:43,927 --> 00:19:45,440
True story.

388
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,514
Look, I gotta tell you something.

389
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,236
I'm not 1 7. I said that so you'd

390
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:56,215
think I was vulnerable.

391
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,343
I'm actually 30. I have a wife

392
00:19:58,343 --> 00:20:00,425
and a job. I'm your congressman.

393
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:02,883
This is ridiculous.

394
00:20:02,883 --> 00:20:04,333
We're great together.

395
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,404
We can talk, make each other

396
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:08,372
laugh, and the sex....

397
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,408
I have no frame of reference,

398
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:12,376
but I thought that was great.

399
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:13,961
It was.

400
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:15,445
Then what's the problem?

401
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,273
Ethan, it's....

402
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,354
It's icky.

403
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,348
''Icky''?

404
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,824
You're actually gonna throw this away

405
00:20:27,824 --> 00:20:30,258
because it's ''icky''?

406
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,358
This isn't easy for me either.

407
00:20:32,358 --> 00:20:34,354
I wish things were different.

408
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:35,882
If you were older

409
00:20:35,882 --> 00:20:42,386
or I was younger or we lived in biblical times I could really--

410
00:20:42,386 --> 00:20:43,466
No, don't say it.

411
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,476
Love you.

412
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:50,360
Are your hands still wet?

413
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,406
Moist.

414
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,484
Let's dry them again.

415
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,508
Or, like, ''Could these margaritas

416
00:21:01,508 --> 00:21:03,425
be any stronger?''

417
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,422
Hey, Chandler.

418
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,324
Hello, Mr. Bing.

419
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,461
Loved your Stevie Wonder last night.

420
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,951
Thanks. About the weekly numbers, I'm

421
00:21:14,951 --> 00:21:17,465
gonna need them on my desk by 9:00.

422
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:19,238
Sure.

423
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:20,233
No problem.

424
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,438
You have to give them something.

425
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,763
That was Gerston, Santos, and

426
00:21:26,763 --> 00:21:28,276
who's the other guy?

427
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,420
Petrie.

428
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,387
Petrie. Right, okay.

429
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,871
Well, some people

430
00:21:31,871 --> 00:21:35,451
are gonna be working this weekend.

431
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,349
Oh, that's nice.

432
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,221
Ross.

433
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:25,470
I'm here.

434
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,244
You are?

435
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,253
We were just....

436
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,457
What?

437
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,773
Great. Now I'm having a baby.

438
00:22:43,773 --> 00:22:45,286
What?

439
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,358
I'm having a baby. I'm having a--

440
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,965
The phone, the phone.

441
00:22:51,965 --> 00:22:53,461
I don't have the phone.

442
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,272
I'm hurt.

443
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:04,732
Let's go.

444
00:23:04,732 --> 00:23:06,216
Come on, people. Woman in labor.

445
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:07,898
Look what I got going.

446
00:23:07,898 --> 00:23:09,445
Save it for the cab.

447
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:13,220
We're going to a hospital.

448
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:14,838
I can't look nice?

449
00:23:14,838 --> 00:23:16,351
There are doctors there.

450
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:17,991
Joey, get out of the fridge.

451
00:23:17,991 --> 00:23:19,521
All right.

452
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:21,327
What is that?

453
00:23:21,327 --> 00:23:22,322
For the ride.

454
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:23,865
Like in a cab--

455
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:24,462
Save it.

456
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,733
Hating this.

457
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:28,229
Monica, come on. Let's go.

458
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,329
Baby coming.

459
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:30,807
I can't believe I'm gonna be

460
00:23:30,807 --> 00:23:32,240
an aunt.

461
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,891
I'll have a nephew.

462
00:23:33,891 --> 00:23:35,438
That's nice. Get out.

463
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:40,363
All right, I'm going.

464
00:23:40,363 --> 00:23:41,375
I'm going.

465
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:50,284
Here we go. Come on.
