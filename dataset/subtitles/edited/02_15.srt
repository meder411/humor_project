1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,384
All right, no peeking.

2
00:00:04,192 --> 00:00:06,422
No peeking. No peeking. No peeking!

3
00:00:07,195 --> 00:00:09,260
All right, but you better be

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,325
wearing clothes when I open my eyes.

5
00:00:13,335 --> 00:00:15,303
All right. Open your eyes.

6
00:00:20,308 --> 00:00:21,872
Sweet mother of all

7
00:00:21,872 --> 00:00:23,436
that is good and pure!

8
00:00:24,412 --> 00:00:26,829
Days of our Lives picked up my option!

9
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:29,246
Congratulations!

10
00:00:29,451 --> 00:00:31,851
Now we can watch Green Acres

11
00:00:31,851 --> 00:00:34,251
the way it was meant to be seen.

12
00:00:36,224 --> 00:00:37,350
So which one is mine?

13
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:39,376
Whichever one you want, man.

14
00:00:39,376 --> 00:00:41,327
Whichever one you want!

15
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,364
Not that one.

16
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:50,429
Oh, yes!

17
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,265
Oh, yeah! That's the stuff.

18
00:00:56,444 --> 00:00:58,344
Do we dare?

19
00:00:58,446 --> 00:01:00,209
We dare.

20
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:55,330
I can't believe two cows made a

21
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:59,368
sacrifice so you guys could watch TV with your feet up.

22
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:01,364
They were chair-shaped cows.

23
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:02,893
They never would have survived

24
00:02:02,893 --> 00:02:04,377
in the wild.

25
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,228
This screen is amazing.

26
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:09,276
Dick Van Dyke is practically life-size.

27
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:13,319
Rose Marie really belongs

28
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,219
on a smaller screen.

29
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,424
Hi, you guys.

30
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:19,843
Hey, you.

31
00:02:19,843 --> 00:02:21,293
Hey, you.

32
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:28,833
How was your day?

33
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,431
You know, pretty much the usual.

34
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:32,735
Sun shining, birds chirping.

35
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,231
Really? Mine too.

36
00:02:34,342 --> 00:02:36,435
Hey, cool. Mine too.

37
00:02:39,414 --> 00:02:42,212
I gotta get to the museum.

38
00:02:42,417 --> 00:02:43,913
I'll see you tonight?

39
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,409
Okay.

40
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:52,348
Bye, guys!

41
00:02:55,263 --> 00:02:56,423
Tonight?

42
00:02:59,267 --> 00:03:01,332
What's tonight?

43
00:03:01,332 --> 00:03:03,397
Our first official date. First date.

44
00:03:05,273 --> 00:03:06,365
Hello?

45
00:03:07,308 --> 00:03:09,173
Hi.

46
00:03:10,278 --> 00:03:11,774
You're waitressing

47
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,270
at my catering thing.

48
00:03:13,314 --> 00:03:15,293
Any of those words trigger anything?

49
00:03:15,293 --> 00:03:17,272
Monica, I forgot.

50
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:18,410
It's our first date.

51
00:03:19,187 --> 00:03:20,683
My mom got me this job.

52
00:03:20,683 --> 00:03:22,179
I can be a waitress!

53
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,837
Thank you, thank you.

54
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,384
See? Phoebe! Phoebe!

55
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:27,461
You'd have to be an actual waitress.

56
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:32,199
It can't be like your ''I can be a bear cub'' thing.

57
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,427
I can be a waitress. Watch this.

58
00:03:35,203 --> 00:03:37,398
Give me two number ones, 86 the bacon.

59
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:39,321
One Adam and Eve on a raft

60
00:03:39,321 --> 00:03:40,436
and wreck them!

61
00:03:54,422 --> 00:03:56,356
It's James Bond.

62
00:03:58,226 --> 00:03:59,739
Sorry we're late.

63
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,252
That's okay. Come on in.

64
00:04:01,296 --> 00:04:02,792
Is Monica Geller coming?

65
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:04,288
I was told she was.

66
00:04:04,365 --> 00:04:06,196
Dr. Burke, it's me.

67
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:07,391
Monica?

68
00:04:08,203 --> 00:04:10,296
My God! You used to be so....

69
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:11,867
I mean, you've--

70
00:04:11,867 --> 00:04:13,363
You must have lost like....

71
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:17,403
You look great.

72
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:19,926
Thank you. This is Phoebe.

73
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,473
She'll be helping me.

74
00:04:22,217 --> 00:04:24,185
Nice to meet you.

75
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:29,304
How you been?

76
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:30,419
Great. How have you been?

77
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:33,340
You know Barbara and I split

78
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,388
or you wouldn't do the head tilt.

79
00:04:35,496 --> 00:04:37,225
The head tilt?

80
00:04:37,298 --> 00:04:41,334
Since the divorce everybody asks how I am with a

81
00:04:41,334 --> 00:04:44,235
sympathetic head tilt. ''How you doing?''

82
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:45,499
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:47,287
It's fine.

84
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,333
Believe me, I do it too.

85
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:50,422
I always answer with the

86
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:52,435
''I'm okay'' head bob. ''I'm okay.''

87
00:04:53,314 --> 00:04:54,781
''You're sure?''

88
00:04:54,781 --> 00:04:56,248
''Yeah, I'm fine.''

89
00:04:56,317 --> 00:04:57,864
I gotta set up the music.

90
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,411
I got a new CD changer.

91
00:04:59,454 --> 00:05:01,319
The divorce only left

92
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:03,184
me with four CDs to change.

93
00:05:03,258 --> 00:05:04,384
That's too bad.

94
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,192
I'll survive.

95
00:05:10,365 --> 00:05:14,267
Two larges, extra cheese on both.

96
00:05:14,302 --> 00:05:18,399
But listen don't ring the buzzer for 1 9.

97
00:05:19,207 --> 00:05:21,368
Ring 20. Geller/Greene.

98
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:25,168
They'll let you in, okay?

99
00:05:27,181 --> 00:05:28,728
If you buzz our door,

100
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:30,275
there's no tip for you.

101
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:33,187
Okay, thanks.

102
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:36,385
Pizza's on the way.

103
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:38,381
I told you we wouldn't have to get up.

104
00:05:39,294 --> 00:05:41,319
What if we have to pee?

105
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:47,199
I'll cancel the sodas.

106
00:05:50,438 --> 00:05:51,467
Get out there.

107
00:05:51,467 --> 00:05:52,496
It's your party!

108
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:54,725
They're so dull!

109
00:05:54,725 --> 00:05:56,209
They're all ophthalmologists.

110
00:05:56,444 --> 00:05:58,395
You're an ophthalmologist.

111
00:05:58,395 --> 00:06:00,346
That's what my parents wanted.

112
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:03,145
I wanted to be a sheriff.

113
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:04,898
That's funny. Cadillac, cataract.

114
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,445
I get it.

115
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:09,281
No! You stay out there!

116
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:10,788
You see?

117
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:11,385
I tell you what.

118
00:06:12,193 --> 00:06:14,673
I'll come get you in five minutes

119
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:17,153
with some sort of kebab emergency.

120
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:21,392
Better. Oh, God, here we go.

121
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,398
Want to see them go nuts?

122
00:06:24,272 --> 00:06:26,206
Watch this.

123
00:06:26,374 --> 00:06:29,172
Who needs glasses?

124
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,866
You are so smitten.

125
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:38,316
I am not!

126
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:40,885
Oh, you are so much

127
00:06:40,885 --> 00:06:42,483
the smitten kitten.

128
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:44,341
Ask him out.

129
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:45,291
Dr. Burke?

130
00:06:46,194 --> 00:06:48,207
I don't think so.

131
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:50,220
I mean, like, he's a grownup.

132
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,746
So? You two are totally

133
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,293
into each other.

134
00:06:54,402 --> 00:06:56,302
He's a family friend.

135
00:06:56,302 --> 00:06:58,202
He's 20 years older than me.

136
00:06:58,306 --> 00:07:01,139
So you're never gonna see him again?

137
00:07:01,242 --> 00:07:02,334
Not never.

138
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:04,824
I'm gonna see him tomorrow

139
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:06,371
at my eye appointment.

140
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:09,260
Didn't you just get your eyes checked?

141
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:15,345
Yeah, but you know 27 is a dangerous eye age.

142
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,725
They're picking teams to play

143
00:07:19,725 --> 00:07:22,159
''Guess my prescription.'' Help me!

144
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:28,315
I'm not saying it was a bad movie.

145
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:32,161
I'm saying it was a little hard to follow.

146
00:07:32,373 --> 00:07:34,386
I told you there would be subtitles.

147
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:36,399
I know.

148
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:39,341
I just didn't want to wear

149
00:07:39,341 --> 00:07:41,371
my glasses on our first date.

150
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,282
Monica?

151
00:07:54,195 --> 00:07:56,294
It would help when I'm kissing you

152
00:07:56,294 --> 00:07:58,393
if you didn't shout my sister's name.

153
00:07:58,433 --> 00:08:00,230
I'm just checking.

154
00:08:01,335 --> 00:08:02,734
Monica?

155
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:04,133
Mon?

156
00:08:34,402 --> 00:08:36,267
What?

157
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,167
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:38,272 --> 00:08:39,768
When you moved your hands

159
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:43,243
down to my butt it was, like,

160
00:08:43,243 --> 00:08:45,177
''Whoa! Ross's hands are on my butt!''

161
00:08:46,414 --> 00:08:49,178
And that's funny. Why?

162
00:08:50,318 --> 00:08:52,286
Well, it's not.

163
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,379
Sorry. I'm just nervous.

164
00:08:54,422 --> 00:08:58,324
I mean, it's you. You know, it's us.

165
00:08:58,426 --> 00:09:00,343
We're crossing that line.

166
00:09:00,343 --> 00:09:02,260
It's sort of a big thing.

167
00:09:02,363 --> 00:09:04,797
Well, I know it's big.

168
00:09:04,797 --> 00:09:07,231
I just didn't know it was ha-ha big.

169
00:09:18,346 --> 00:09:19,842
Okay, my hands were

170
00:09:19,842 --> 00:09:21,338
nowhere near your butt.

171
00:09:21,382 --> 00:09:23,179
I know! I know!

172
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:24,815
I was thinking about

173
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,379
the last time they were there.

174
00:09:27,154 --> 00:09:29,247
I'm sorry. Look! I promise.

175
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,786
I won't laugh anymore.

176
00:09:30,786 --> 00:09:32,282
Put your hands back.

177
00:09:32,393 --> 00:09:35,260
No, see, now I can't.

178
00:09:36,297 --> 00:09:38,276
I'm feeling too self-conscious.

179
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:40,255
Touch my butt.

180
00:09:41,202 --> 00:09:42,749
Just one cheek.

181
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,296
The moment's gone.

182
00:09:44,405 --> 00:09:45,901
I'll back up into your hands.

183
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:47,397
That's romantic.

184
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:48,703
-Touch it.

185
00:09:48,703 --> 00:09:49,197
-No.

186
00:09:49,277 --> 00:09:50,227
-Come on, squeeze it.

187
00:09:50,227 --> 00:09:51,177
-No!

188
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:51,773
-Rub it?

189
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:52,267
-No.

190
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,847
Oh, come on!

191
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:55,314
Would you just grab my ass?

192
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,837
Wow! Look at that!

193
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:07,689
The car is on fire yet somehow

194
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:12,425
its expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax.

195
00:10:14,402 --> 00:10:17,303
You got a Chee-to on your face, man.

196
00:10:28,249 --> 00:10:29,779
Aren't you supposed

197
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:31,309
to be out with Rachel?

198
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:33,410
That was 1 4 hours ago.

199
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:38,323
We gotta set the clock on this.

200
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,328
So how'd it go?

201
00:10:42,363 --> 00:10:44,342
Have you ever been, you know,

202
00:10:44,342 --> 00:10:49,327
fooling around with a girl and she started laughing?

203
00:10:49,537 --> 00:10:51,266
Yeah.

204
00:10:51,372 --> 00:10:54,324
But it was 1 982 and my Flock of

205
00:10:54,324 --> 00:10:57,276
Seagulls haircut tickled her chin.

206
00:11:00,214 --> 00:11:01,374
She laughed at you?

207
00:11:01,415 --> 00:11:04,213
It could have been worse.

208
00:11:04,285 --> 00:11:06,276
I could have been naked.

209
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:14,192
I've wanted this since 9th grade.

210
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:20,199
I want it to be perfect and right and....

211
00:11:20,434 --> 00:11:22,317
Why isn't that laser

212
00:11:22,317 --> 00:11:24,200
cutting through the paint?

213
00:11:24,305 --> 00:11:25,852
It's the Miracle Wax!

214
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,399
It certainly is a miracle.

215
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:28,806
Hi, you guys.

216
00:11:28,806 --> 00:11:29,403
Hey.

217
00:11:31,345 --> 00:11:33,438
Listen, I was thinking about....

218
00:11:34,248 --> 00:11:35,442
Can you guys speak up?

219
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:37,866
It's harder for us to hear you

220
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:39,515
when you lower your voice.

221
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:40,867
Hallway?

222
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:41,413
Yeah.

223
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,278
I'm sorry about last night.

224
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:53,326
I really want to make it up to you.

225
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:54,447
There's no need to make it--

226
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:55,527
How?

227
00:11:57,271 --> 00:11:59,239
Well, I was thinking maybe

228
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:04,277
a romantic dinner with candles and wine.

229
00:12:04,311 --> 00:12:06,842
And then maybe going

230
00:12:06,842 --> 00:12:12,185
back to my place for dessert.

231
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:16,388
That sounds perfect.

232
00:12:24,398 --> 00:12:26,298
What's this?

233
00:12:26,298 --> 00:12:28,198
Would you get us a couple of beers?

234
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,207
I'm going to look into your eyes now.

235
00:12:36,243 --> 00:12:37,437
Really?

236
00:12:38,245 --> 00:12:40,236
Yeah, that's my job.

237
00:12:41,215 --> 00:12:43,342
All right. Look up.

238
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:45,407
Look down.

239
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,317
No, open your eyes and look down.

240
00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:50,245
That's right.

241
00:12:50,324 --> 00:12:52,258
Look into the light.

242
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:55,318
Now look at me.

243
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,161
Okay!

244
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:07,791
Your eyes look good.

245
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,275
Those are good eyes.

246
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:11,367
Good. They feel good.

247
00:13:12,213 --> 00:13:13,271
In my head.

248
00:13:19,186 --> 00:13:20,301
It was great to see you.

249
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:21,416
You too.

250
00:13:22,423 --> 00:13:24,323
You too.

251
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:30,229
Goodbye.

252
00:13:31,398 --> 00:13:32,393
Drops!

253
00:13:32,393 --> 00:13:33,388
What?

254
00:13:34,235 --> 00:13:35,395
Here, they're free.

255
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:40,339
Thanks.

256
00:13:41,442 --> 00:13:43,325
I better be going.

257
00:13:43,325 --> 00:13:45,208
Yeah, I'll see you later.

258
00:13:45,312 --> 00:13:47,303
Thanks again.

259
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:02,345
We have to get you lazy boys

260
00:14:02,345 --> 00:14:04,296
out of these chairs.

261
00:14:07,268 --> 00:14:09,264
You should go out and be with

262
00:14:09,264 --> 00:14:11,260
the three-dimensional people.

263
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:14,397
No. Inside good.

264
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:18,209
Outside bad.

265
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:20,404
You guys are so pathetic.

266
00:14:21,182 --> 00:14:22,308
Oh, Xanadu!

267
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,187
She's one of us now.

268
00:14:30,224 --> 00:14:31,270
Hi, you guys.

269
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,316
Hey.

270
00:14:33,227 --> 00:14:34,324
We wanted to stop by

271
00:14:34,324 --> 00:14:35,421
and say good night.

272
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,198
Good night.

273
00:14:38,332 --> 00:14:40,880
They won't even turn their heads.

274
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,428
All right. I'm taking off my shirt.

275
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,401
No. She's lying.

276
00:14:53,214 --> 00:14:57,344
Stop sending food to our apartment!

277
00:14:58,352 --> 00:15:00,303
Why are you dressed up?

278
00:15:00,303 --> 00:15:02,254
You're not the only one with a date.

279
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:03,335
You have a date? Who with?

280
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:04,381
No one.

281
00:15:05,192 --> 00:15:06,238
What's his name?

282
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,284
Nothing.

283
00:15:08,262 --> 00:15:09,286
Come on, tell me.

284
00:15:10,264 --> 00:15:13,165
All right, but I'm excited about this.

285
00:15:13,267 --> 00:15:14,814
Promise you won't get

286
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,361
big-brothery and judgmental.

287
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,402
I promise.

288
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:19,285
Richard Burke.

289
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,365
Who's Richard Burke?

290
00:15:20,474 --> 00:15:22,203
Dr. Burke?

291
00:15:23,277 --> 00:15:24,824
You have a date with Dr. Burke?

292
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:29,278
Why? Why? Why should that bother me?

293
00:15:29,316 --> 00:15:30,300
I love that man.

294
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,216
He's like a a brother to Dad.

295
00:15:36,423 --> 00:15:38,857
Here we go.

296
00:15:38,857 --> 00:15:41,291
No, I think it's great that he's 50.

297
00:15:41,428 --> 00:15:43,908
He'll be an inspiration to men who are

298
00:15:43,908 --> 00:15:46,388
almost retired all over the world.

299
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:49,300
He's the brightest, most sophisticated,

300
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,399
sexiest man I've ever been with.

301
00:15:51,438 --> 00:15:53,201
He's sexy?

302
00:15:53,307 --> 00:15:56,333
Oh, God! Absolutely!

303
00:15:58,212 --> 00:15:59,236
Damn!

304
00:15:59,346 --> 00:16:00,341
It's the museum again.

305
00:16:00,341 --> 00:16:01,336
Can I--?

306
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,213
Dr. Burke kissed me once.

307
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,276
When?

308
00:16:05,352 --> 00:16:07,365
When I was 7, I crashed my bike

309
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:11,755
out in front of his house and to stop me from crying,

310
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:13,353
he kissed me right here.

311
00:16:14,161 --> 00:16:14,809
Oh, you are so lucky!

312
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:15,457
I know.

313
00:16:17,197 --> 00:16:18,795
Australopithecus isn't supposed

314
00:16:18,795 --> 00:16:20,393
to be in that display.

315
00:16:22,403 --> 00:16:24,837
No, Homo habilis was erect.

316
00:16:24,837 --> 00:16:27,271
Australopithecus was never fully erect.

317
00:16:27,374 --> 00:16:29,365
Well, maybe he was nervous.

318
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:37,850
Oh, look!

319
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,283
I can't believe this!

320
00:16:39,386 --> 00:16:41,382
Homo habilis can't use tools yet,

321
00:16:41,382 --> 00:16:43,378
and he has clay pots?

322
00:16:44,191 --> 00:16:45,687
Why don't they just

323
00:16:45,687 --> 00:16:47,183
give him a microwave?

324
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:48,790
Clearly he'd have no place

325
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:50,286
to plug it in.

326
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,491
Sorry.

327
00:16:56,303 --> 00:16:58,282
I'm sorry this is taking so long.

328
00:16:58,282 --> 00:17:00,261
It's longer than I expected.

329
00:17:00,374 --> 00:17:01,369
We will have dinner.

330
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:02,364
It's fine.

331
00:17:03,177 --> 00:17:05,145
Karl!

332
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,211
Oh, God.

333
00:17:21,195 --> 00:17:22,292
Wow! Is that Michelle?

334
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:23,389
Yep.

335
00:17:24,164 --> 00:17:26,359
I've not seen her since graduation.

336
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,283
Oh, my God, that night

337
00:17:28,283 --> 00:17:30,166
she got so dru--

338
00:17:32,272 --> 00:17:33,364
Emotional.

339
00:17:34,174 --> 00:17:36,267
You know, she's having another baby.

340
00:17:36,377 --> 00:17:38,373
I thought she just had one.

341
00:17:38,373 --> 00:17:40,369
No, no. Henry's almost 2.

342
00:17:40,414 --> 00:17:42,393
And he's talking

343
00:17:42,393 --> 00:17:44,372
and everything. Here.

344
00:17:45,185 --> 00:17:46,800
He told me he liked me

345
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,415
better than his other grandpa.

346
00:17:49,189 --> 00:17:51,185
In all fairness, his other

347
00:17:51,185 --> 00:17:53,181
grandpa's a drunk, but still....

348
00:17:55,295 --> 00:17:57,286
You're a grandpa.

349
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:01,361
Yeah.

350
00:18:06,273 --> 00:18:08,264
Are we nuts here?

351
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,240
I don't know. Maybe.

352
00:18:10,344 --> 00:18:12,858
I mean, I'm dating a man

353
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,372
whose pool I once peed in.

354
00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:18,344
I didn't need to know that.

355
00:18:19,253 --> 00:18:22,154
I guess 21 years is a lot.

356
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:24,669
Hell, I'm a whole ''person

357
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:27,149
who can drink'' older than you.

358
00:18:28,262 --> 00:18:30,162
Yeah.

359
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:33,461
So....

360
00:18:36,403 --> 00:18:38,337
So maybe we should just....

361
00:18:38,337 --> 00:18:40,271
Yeah.

362
00:18:42,376 --> 00:18:44,276
Maybe....

363
00:18:48,182 --> 00:18:49,410
Wow.

364
00:18:51,418 --> 00:18:53,181
This really sucks.

365
00:18:53,287 --> 00:18:56,188
Yeah, it sure does.

366
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,753
We don't have to decide

367
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:16,266
anything now, do we?

368
00:19:16,376 --> 00:19:19,436
No, there's no rush or anything.

369
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:22,343
Pizza delivery!

370
00:19:22,343 --> 00:19:24,339
Oh, I'm gonna kill those guys!

371
00:19:27,187 --> 00:19:28,279
Rach.

372
00:19:28,388 --> 00:19:30,288
I'm done.

373
00:19:30,457 --> 00:19:32,305
Yeah, well, you know what?

374
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,153
So is Sorrentino's.

375
00:19:34,261 --> 00:19:35,808
I'm sorry.

376
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,355
Why don't we find someplace else?

377
00:19:37,397 --> 00:19:39,331
It's late. Everything's closed.

378
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:41,265
We'll do it again.

379
00:19:41,301 --> 00:19:42,393
No, no, we won't.

380
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,262
We won't?

381
00:19:45,205 --> 00:19:46,399
Come on.

382
00:19:47,207 --> 00:19:48,401
Okay, that's dead, right?

383
00:19:51,278 --> 00:19:53,178
What are we doing?

384
00:19:53,213 --> 00:19:54,845
Do you want Cran-Apple or Cran-Grape?

385
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:56,477
Grape.

386
00:19:59,186 --> 00:20:02,287
Okay, now sit.

387
00:20:06,393 --> 00:20:09,385
Oh, my God!

388
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:11,363
Billions of years ago,

389
00:20:11,363 --> 00:20:13,297
Earth was only--

390
00:20:15,302 --> 00:20:16,291
Sorry.

391
00:20:20,307 --> 00:20:23,308
So what are we looking at?

392
00:20:24,344 --> 00:20:26,323
See that little cluster

393
00:20:26,323 --> 00:20:28,302
of stars next to the big one?

394
00:20:28,348 --> 00:20:31,249
That is Ursa Major.

395
00:20:31,418 --> 00:20:32,931
Really?

396
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,444
I have no idea. Could be.

397
00:20:37,457 --> 00:20:40,255
I'm sorry I had to work tonight.

398
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,428
Oh, that's okay.

399
00:20:42,462 --> 00:20:45,226
You were worth the wait.

400
00:20:45,465 --> 00:20:48,434
And I don't just mean tonight.

401
00:20:57,444 --> 00:20:59,435
You're not laughing.

402
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:02,312
This time it's not so funny.

403
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,293
Loosen the knot.

404
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:36,511
Oh, God!

405
00:21:37,517 --> 00:21:41,317
Honey? That's okay.

406
00:21:41,455 --> 00:21:43,355
What?

407
00:21:43,457 --> 00:21:44,953
Oh, no. You just rolled

408
00:21:44,953 --> 00:21:46,449
over the juice box.

409
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:57,328
Thank God!

410
00:22:25,198 --> 00:22:26,392
Hey.

411
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,191
Hey, you.

412
00:22:34,308 --> 00:22:35,804
I can't believe I'm waking up

413
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:37,300
next to you.

414
00:22:37,444 --> 00:22:39,503
I know. It is pretty unbelieve--

415
00:22:41,415 --> 00:22:42,928
What?

416
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,441
We're not alone.

417
00:23:12,312 --> 00:23:14,371
Is that the fire alarm?

418
00:23:14,481 --> 00:23:16,210
Yeah.

419
00:23:19,386 --> 00:23:20,853
It's not warm yet.

420
00:23:20,853 --> 00:23:22,320
We still have time.

421
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,789
Cool.

422
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:26,188
-Yeah, yeah. Cool!
