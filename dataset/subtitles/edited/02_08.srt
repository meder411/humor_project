1
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,430
Ross kissed me.

2
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:07,872
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

3
00:00:07,872 --> 00:00:09,271
Oh, my God.

4
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,793
It was unbelievable.

5
00:00:11,793 --> 00:00:14,244
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

6
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,343
Let's hear everything.

7
00:00:16,343 --> 00:00:18,339
Get the wine and unplug the phone.

8
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:20,368
Does this end well

9
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:22,285
or do we need to get tissues?

10
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,448
It ended very well.

11
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,375
Do not start without me!

12
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,292
Do not start without me!

13
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,859
Let's hear about the kiss.

14
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:34,356
Was it a soft brush against your lips?

15
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,335
Or was it a ''I gotta have you now''

16
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:38,269
kind of thing?

17
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,401
At first it was really intense,

18
00:00:40,401 --> 00:00:42,397
you know? And then....

19
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,409
Oh, God. And then we just

20
00:00:44,409 --> 00:00:46,309
sort of sunk into it.

21
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,330
Was he holding you?

22
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,281
Or were his hands on your back?

23
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:51,897
No, actually,

24
00:00:51,897 --> 00:00:55,902
first they started out on my waist then they slid up

25
00:00:55,902 --> 00:00:57,517
and they were in my hair.

26
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,443
And then I kissed her.

27
00:01:01,443 --> 00:01:03,360
Tongue?

28
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,442
Yeah.

29
00:01:04,442 --> 00:01:05,454
Cool.

30
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,573
All right, check out this bad boy.

31
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:57,829
1 2 megabytes of RAM, 500-megabyte

32
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:02,337
hard drive, spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits

33
00:02:02,337 --> 00:02:04,254
at over 28,000 bps.

34
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,450
What are you gonna use it for?

35
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:08,455
Games and stuff.

36
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,897
There are no jobs.

37
00:02:11,897 --> 00:02:13,364
There are no jobs for me.

38
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,424
Oh, wait, here's one.

39
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:18,284
Are you willing to cook naked?

40
00:02:18,284 --> 00:02:20,332
There's an ad for a naked chef?

41
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,853
No. But if you'll cook naked, then

42
00:02:22,853 --> 00:02:25,333
you might be willing to dance naked.

43
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,436
And then....

44
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,352
So, how'd you make out last night?

45
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,452
That's funny. That is painfully funny.

46
00:02:38,452 --> 00:02:40,448
No, wait, wait.

47
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:43,354
Yeah, that's just painful.

48
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:44,926
Wait a minute.

49
00:02:44,926 --> 00:02:46,456
I thought last night was great.

50
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,383
It was. But I get home and I see

51
00:02:49,383 --> 00:02:54,498
Julie's saline solution on my table and I think, ''What am I doing?''

52
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,323
Here I am with Julie, this incredible

53
00:02:57,323 --> 00:03:01,329
woman, who I care about and cares about me

54
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:03,246
and I'm throwing it all away?

55
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,443
You got all that from saline solution?

56
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,852
I'm the same way. Show me a bottle

57
00:03:09,852 --> 00:03:12,451
of Visine and I'm like, ''Who am I?''

58
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,326
Wait. We're talking about Rachel.

59
00:03:15,326 --> 00:03:17,226
You and Rachel.

60
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,798
I've dreamed of me and Rachel

61
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:22,266
for 10 years, but now I'm with Julie.

62
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,802
It's like, me and Julie,

63
00:03:23,802 --> 00:03:25,269
me and Rachel.

64
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,362
Me and Julie, me and Rach--

65
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,332
Rachel. Rachel.

66
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:31,438
Hey, you.

67
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:32,433
How are you?

68
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,041
Good. How are you?

69
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,537
Good.

70
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,328
Hi, honey.

71
00:03:37,328 --> 00:03:38,374
Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie?

72
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:40,344
Julie!

73
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,285
How are you?

74
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:43,919
Good.

75
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,482
Good.

76
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,351
So everybody's here.

77
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,485
Everybody's good.

78
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,558
Good and great and here.

79
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:57,265
Were you gonna play something?

80
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,382
Well, actually--

81
00:03:58,382 --> 00:03:59,394
Play it.

82
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:02,399
All right.

83
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,824
Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses.

84
00:04:04,824 --> 00:04:06,405
What?

85
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,408
Okay. Hi.

86
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,343
Hello. Hi. Okay.

87
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:18,887
This is a song about a love triangle between three people

88
00:04:18,887 --> 00:04:20,451
that I made up.

89
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,325
It's called

90
00:04:25,325 --> 00:04:27,321
''Two of Them Kissed Last Night.''

91
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,352
There was a girl

92
00:04:31,352 --> 00:04:33,269
We'll call her Betty

93
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,903
And a guy

94
00:04:34,903 --> 00:04:36,433
Let's call him Neil

95
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,356
Now I can't stress

96
00:04:39,356 --> 00:04:41,335
This point too strongly

97
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:44,373
This story isn't real

98
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,966
Now our Neil must decide

99
00:04:48,966 --> 00:04:51,446
Who will be the girl he casts aside?

100
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:52,941
Will Betty be the one

101
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:54,391
Who he loves truly?

102
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,473
Or will it be the one

103
00:04:56,473 --> 00:04:58,486
Who we'll call Loolie?

104
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,347
He must decide

105
00:05:02,347 --> 00:05:03,393
He must decide

106
00:05:03,436 --> 00:05:05,836
Even though I made him up

107
00:05:05,836 --> 00:05:08,236
He must decide

108
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,707
Well, this is a nice résumé.

109
00:05:13,707 --> 00:05:16,204
Nice, nice, nice.

110
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,408
Muy impressivo.

111
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,253
Shame none of it's true.

112
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:24,314
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

113
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,938
No, it's all true. Just a little

114
00:05:26,938 --> 00:05:29,452
nervous, that's all. I'm fine now.

115
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,743
Mr. Rastatter, what does this job

116
00:05:32,743 --> 00:05:35,257
entail? The ad wasn't too clear.

117
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,785
Mockolate.

118
00:05:36,785 --> 00:05:38,235
I'm sorry?

119
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,301
Mockolate.

120
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:42,331
It's a synthetic chocolate substitute.

121
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,857
Go ahead, try a piece. We think

122
00:05:46,857 --> 00:05:49,337
Mockolate is better than chocolate.

123
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,350
All right.

124
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,188
I love how it crumbles.

125
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,893
Chocolate doesn't do that.

126
00:06:03,893 --> 00:06:05,491
No, ma'am.

127
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,312
We should be getting

128
00:06:08,312 --> 00:06:10,325
our FDA approval any day now.

129
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,301
Hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving.

130
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,822
The way we see it,

131
00:06:14,822 --> 00:06:18,776
chocolate dominates your major food-preparation

132
00:06:18,776 --> 00:06:21,210
holidays: Easter, Christmas.

133
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:25,328
Given the right marketing we can make Thanksgiving

134
00:06:25,328 --> 00:06:27,307
the Mockolate holiday.

135
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,409
Wow.

136
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,448
Aren't you gonna swallow that?

137
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,419
Waiting for it to stop bubbling.

138
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,429
Yeah. Isn't that great?

139
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,944
Anyhow, we're looking for chefs

140
00:06:40,944 --> 00:06:43,424
who can create Thanksgiving recipes.

141
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,261
You interested?

142
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,465
Absolutely.

143
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,907
I love creating new recipes and

144
00:06:52,907 --> 00:06:55,438
Thanksgiving. And now I love Mockolate.

145
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,238
Really?

146
00:06:57,283 --> 00:06:58,380
Especially the aftertaste.

147
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,380
I tell you that'll last you till Christmas.

148
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,226
How about Mockolate mousse?

149
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,386
It's not very Thanksgiving-y.

150
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:14,393
How about Pilgrim Mockolate mousse?

151
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,427
What makes it Pilgrim?

152
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:19,328
We'll put buckles on it.

153
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,308
Did Ross call?

154
00:07:24,308 --> 00:07:26,208
No, I'm sorry.

155
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:28,241
Why didn't he call?

156
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:30,237
He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he?

157
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,381
He'll stay with her and she'll be,

158
00:07:32,381 --> 00:07:34,446
''Hi, I'm Julie. Ross picked me.

159
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:37,353
We'll get married and have kids

160
00:07:37,353 --> 00:07:39,452
and dig up stuff together!''

161
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:42,842
No offense,

162
00:07:42,842 --> 00:07:44,457
but that sounds nothing like her.

163
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,361
What am I gonna do?

164
00:07:48,361 --> 00:07:50,357
This is like a complete nightmare.

165
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,933
I know. This must be so hard.

166
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:55,430
''Oh, no. Two women love me.

167
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:57,840
They're both gorgeous,

168
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,929
my wallet's too small for my 50s and my diamond shoes

169
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:02,379
are too tight.''

170
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,378
Here's a thought--

171
00:08:05,378 --> 00:08:07,374
Don't ever touch the computer.

172
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,805
Ross, listen.

173
00:08:09,805 --> 00:08:11,289
I got two words for you:

174
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,290
Threesome.

175
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:20,297
You still have another word,

176
00:08:20,297 --> 00:08:22,197
if you wanna use it.

177
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,848
Oh, hey. I think I know what it is.

178
00:08:23,848 --> 00:08:25,395
Help.

179
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,354
Let's get logical about this.

180
00:08:27,354 --> 00:08:28,503
Make a list.

181
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,302
Rachel and Julie: Pros and Cons.

182
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,844
We'll put their names

183
00:08:36,844 --> 00:08:38,340
in different fonts.

184
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:41,318
I can use colors for each column.

185
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,305
Can't we just use a pen?

186
00:08:43,305 --> 00:08:45,256
No, Amish boy.

187
00:08:46,492 --> 00:08:48,960
Let's start with the cons because

188
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,428
they're more fun. Rachel first.

189
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,366
I don't know. I mean....

190
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:57,868
All right, I guess you can say

191
00:08:57,868 --> 00:09:00,268
she's a little spoiled sometimes.

192
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,397
You could say that.

193
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,273
I guess, sometimes

194
00:09:06,273 --> 00:09:08,269
she's a little ditsy, you know?

195
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,248
And I've seen her be

196
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:12,182
a little too into her looks.

197
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,782
Julie and I have a lot in common

198
00:09:14,782 --> 00:09:17,279
because we're both paleontologists.

199
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,381
Rachel's just a waitress.

200
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,222
Waitress.

201
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:22,874
Got it.

202
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:24,421
You guys wanna play Doom?

203
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,200
Or we could keep doing this.

204
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,497
What else?

205
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,500
I don't know.

206
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,504
Oh. Her ankles are a little chubby.

207
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,908
Okay, let's do Julie.

208
00:09:40,908 --> 00:09:42,404
What's wrong with her?

209
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:48,412
She's not Rachel.

210
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,790
This is pumpkin pie

211
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,257
with a Mockolate crust.

212
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,277
Mockolate cranberry cake,

213
00:09:55,277 --> 00:09:57,228
and Mockolate chip cookies.

214
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,355
Just like the Indians served.

215
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:03,867
Oh, my God.

216
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:05,266
''Oh, my God'' good?

217
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:07,306
Oh, my God, I can't believe

218
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,274
you let me put this in my mouth.

219
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,857
Sweet Lord!

220
00:10:11,857 --> 00:10:13,438
This is what evil must taste like.

221
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,948
I'm telling you,

222
00:10:20,948 --> 00:10:22,444
this thing won't print.

223
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,486
Yes, I pressed that button 100 times.

224
00:10:25,486 --> 00:10:28,484
For a hot line, you're not so hot.

225
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,253
What's in the background?

226
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,493
Are you watching Star Trek?

227
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,490
So did you break Julie's heart?

228
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,407
Yes.

229
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,429
It was horrible. She cried, I cried.

230
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:50,381
She threw things, they hit me.

231
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:53,382
I did the right thing.

232
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:57,422
So Spock actually hugs his father?

233
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,258
Hey, do you guys have--?

234
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,224
Where you going?

235
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:11,334
I just got back from Julie's.

236
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:16,237
No, no. It's not what you think.

237
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,368
It's the other thing.

238
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,883
Well, what's the other thing?

239
00:11:26,883 --> 00:11:29,283
What do I think?

240
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,382
Well....

241
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,358
He broke up with Julie.

242
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:38,295
Well, go hug her, for God's sakes.

243
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:40,277
Really?

244
00:11:40,277 --> 00:11:41,289
Really.

245
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,383
It's always been you, Rach.

246
00:11:44,383 --> 00:11:46,465
Oh, God.

247
00:11:57,483 --> 00:11:58,950
Oh, this is good.

248
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,417
This is really good.

249
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:03,513
I know, I know. It's almost....

250
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,345
What do you say we take a walk?

251
00:12:11,345 --> 00:12:13,262
Just us. Not them.

252
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:14,845
Let me get my coat.

253
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:16,358
Okay. No, hey.

254
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,268
I'll get your coat.

255
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:28,538
He's going to get my coat, Joey.

256
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:31,361
You guys, I can't believe this.

257
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:33,374
This is unbelievable.

258
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:34,948
What's that?

259
00:12:34,948 --> 00:12:36,444
What? Nothing!

260
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,837
I saw my name. What is it?

261
00:12:39,837 --> 00:12:41,384
No, no. See? See?

262
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,451
Hey, it's printing.

263
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:46,292
Hey, it's printing!

264
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:48,413
Let me see.

265
00:12:48,413 --> 00:12:50,261
Someone order a coat?

266
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,883
He wrote something about me

267
00:12:51,883 --> 00:12:53,464
and won't let me see.

268
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,497
He won't? He won't.

269
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,893
Because isn't that...

270
00:12:59,893 --> 00:13:02,310
the short story you were writing?

271
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,365
Yes, it is a short story

272
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:06,316
that I was writing.

273
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,343
I'm in it? Let me read it.

274
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,251
No!

275
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,340
Come on.

276
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,456
Hey, why don't you read it to her?

277
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,335
All right.

278
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,477
''It was summer.

279
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,477
And it was hot.

280
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,549
Rachel was there.

281
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,261
A lonely gray couch.

282
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,365
'Oh, look!' cried Ned.

283
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,452
And then the kingdom was his forever.

284
00:13:57,452 --> 00:13:59,403
The end.''

285
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,221
That's it?

286
00:14:04,221 --> 00:14:06,234
You're the worst writer in the world.

287
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,246
This isn't funny anymore.

288
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,310
There's something about me

289
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,306
on that paper. I want to see it.

290
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,318
No, you don't.

291
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,234
All right. If you guys want

292
00:14:18,234 --> 00:14:20,213
to be children, that's fine.

293
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,351
I do not need to see it.

294
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:29,930
What is this?

295
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,426
That is....

296
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:33,427
What is this?

297
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:34,905
Thank you.

298
00:14:34,905 --> 00:14:36,338
Good luck.

299
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,411
Okay. Just remember how crazy

300
00:14:40,411 --> 00:14:42,345
I am about you, okay?

301
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:45,361
''Kind of ditsy''? ''Too into her looks''?

302
00:14:45,361 --> 00:14:48,341
''Spoiled''?

303
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,450
That's a little spoiled.

304
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,446
He was supposed to type ''little.''

305
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,393
''Just a waitress''?

306
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:58,486
Now, that was....

307
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,392
I mean, as opposed to....

308
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,199
Okay, is this over yet? Rach?

309
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:09,237
I do not have chubby ankles!

310
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,332
No. I--

311
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,405
Look at the other side.

312
00:15:12,405 --> 00:15:14,401
Look at Julie's column.

313
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,347
''She's not Rachem''?

314
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,213
What's a Rachem?

315
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,769
A stupid paleontology word I wouldn't

316
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:24,220
know because I'm just a waitress.

317
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,414
Rach, come on.

318
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,375
It's ''She's not Rachel''!

319
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,423
She's not....

320
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,233
Rachel?

321
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,432
My diary. Brilliant.

322
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:43,452
If I said it was my diary,

323
00:15:43,452 --> 00:15:45,431
she wouldn't have made me read it.

324
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,759
True. You'd be a great person

325
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:51,273
to have around after an emergency.

326
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,283
I cannot believe Ross made this list.

327
00:15:54,386 --> 00:15:55,870
I know.

328
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:57,354
What a dinkus.

329
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,786
Cut him some slack.

330
00:15:59,786 --> 00:16:01,282
It was Chandler's idea.

331
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,224
What?

332
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,842
Oh, good. I was hoping

333
00:16:04,842 --> 00:16:06,389
that would come up.

334
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:08,297
This was your idea?

335
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,416
Let's get some perspective here.

336
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,498
These things happen for a reason.

337
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,229
Yeah. You.

338
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,289
Pheebs, back me up. You believe

339
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:20,337
in that karma crap, don't you?

340
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,294
Good luck in your next life

341
00:16:23,294 --> 00:16:25,342
as a dung beetle.

342
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,460
Rach.

343
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,431
Open up, please?

344
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,536
When somebody does not buzz you in,

345
00:16:50,536 --> 00:16:55,337
that means, ''go away'' not, ''climb up the fire escape.''

346
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,416
I want to read you your pro list.

347
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,385
Not interested.

348
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,303
''Number one:

349
00:17:03,303 --> 00:17:05,186
the way you cry at game shows.

350
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,258
Number two:

351
00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:09,192
how much you love your friends.

352
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,241
Number three: how you play

353
00:17:11,241 --> 00:17:13,254
with your hair when you're nervous.

354
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,311
Number four: how brave you are

355
00:17:15,311 --> 00:17:17,290
for starting life over.

356
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:18,899
Number five:

357
00:17:18,899 --> 00:17:20,395
how great you are with Ben.

358
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,300
Number six: the way you smell.''

359
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,327
What are you doing?

360
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:29,210
Want to open the window?

361
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:30,441
Oh, yeah.

362
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,214
What are you doing out there?

363
00:17:34,253 --> 00:17:35,737
You must be freezing.

364
00:17:35,737 --> 00:17:37,221
Know what you need?

365
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,837
How about a steaming cup

366
00:17:38,837 --> 00:17:40,418
of hot Mockolate?

367
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,456
Come on, open up.

368
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,728
Come on.

369
00:17:48,728 --> 00:17:50,224
You gotta give me another chance.

370
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,237
No.

371
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,299
No?

372
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:54,294
That's what I said.

373
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,954
We should go.

374
00:17:55,954 --> 00:17:57,535
You don't have to go. We're done.

375
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,824
I know how you must--

376
00:17:59,824 --> 00:18:01,371
No, you don't, Ross.

377
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,215
Imagine the worst things

378
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:06,183
you think about yourself.

379
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,316
How would you feel if the person

380
00:18:08,316 --> 00:18:14,387
you trusted most in the world not only thinks them but actually uses them

381
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:16,383
as reasons not to be with you.

382
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,862
No, but see, I want to be with you

383
00:18:18,862 --> 00:18:21,296
in spite of all those things.

384
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,333
Well, that's mighty big of you, Ross.

385
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,432
I said, don't go.

386
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,204
You know what?

387
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,740
If it were the other way, there

388
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,811
is nothing you could put on a list that would make me

389
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:39,307
not wanna be with you.

390
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,965
Well, I guess that's

391
00:18:40,965 --> 00:18:42,512
the difference between us.

392
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,450
See, I'd never make a list.

393
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,838
I never know how long to wait in this

394
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:06,403
type of situation before you can talk.

395
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,272
Maybe a little longer.

396
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,302
In these recipes,

397
00:19:16,302 --> 00:19:18,185
the quantities may seem unusual.

398
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,757
Like the coconut Mockolate

399
00:19:19,757 --> 00:19:21,224
holiday nut bars?

400
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,822
I said four cups of coconut

401
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:25,943
and four of nuts and only one tablespoon

402
00:19:25,943 --> 00:19:27,490
of Mockolate.

403
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,263
Doesn't matter.

404
00:19:30,263 --> 00:19:31,292
What?

405
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:34,355
Our FDA approval didn't come through.

406
00:19:34,355 --> 00:19:37,307
Something about laboratory rats.

407
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,778
Gosh, I'm sorry.

408
00:19:40,778 --> 00:19:43,246
Yeah. Anyhow, here's your check.

409
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:45,733
Thank you for all the trouble

410
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:47,217
you went through.

411
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,315
You didn't eat a lot of it

412
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:51,311
while you were cooking, did you?

413
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,221
Well, I ate some.

414
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:56,226
Oh, some is fine. Some is not a lot.

415
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,325
So it doesn't burn

416
00:19:59,325 --> 00:20:01,321
when you pee, does it?

417
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,376
Is that him again?

418
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,902
I'd come to the phone,

419
00:20:21,902 --> 00:20:24,353
but my ankles are weighing me down.

420
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:28,357
I don't think this is the best time.

421
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,362
Look, can you do something for me?

422
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,397
Sure. What?

423
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,463
All right.

424
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,373
Music?

425
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,273
Sure.

426
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,879
The next one's dedicated

427
00:20:52,879 --> 00:20:54,375
to Rachel from Ross.

428
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,454
Rachel, he wants you to know

429
00:20:56,454 --> 00:21:02,221
he's deeply sorry and he hopes you can forgive him.

430
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,871
We've just gotten a call from Rachel

431
00:21:34,871 --> 00:21:37,351
and she told us what Ross did.

432
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,892
It's appalling.

433
00:21:38,892 --> 00:21:41,978
Ross, if you're listening I don't wanna play

434
00:21:41,978 --> 00:21:43,491
your song anymore.

435
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:50,341
Let's devote our time

436
00:21:50,341 --> 00:21:52,275
to a couple that stands a chance.

437
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:54,925
Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you.

438
00:21:54,925 --> 00:21:57,473
She hopes you two will work it out.

439
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,374
Thanks for coming in again.

440
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:34,902
Not at all. I have no morals.

441
00:22:34,902 --> 00:22:36,352
I need cash.

442
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,456
Like I'm looking in a mirror.

443
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:43,392
Anyway, they're called Fish-tachios.

444
00:22:43,392 --> 00:22:46,492
They taste exactly like pistachios.

445
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:48,914
But they're made primarily

446
00:22:48,914 --> 00:22:50,563
of reconstituted fish bits.

447
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,400
Here, try one.

448
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,497
All right.

449
00:22:54,306 --> 00:22:55,790
You're not allergic to anything?

450
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,274
Cat hair.

451
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,468
Oh, sorry.
