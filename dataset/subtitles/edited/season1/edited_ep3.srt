1
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:05,832
Hi, guys.

2
00:00:05,832 --> 00:00:06,395
Hey, Phoebe.

3
00:00:07,204 --> 00:00:08,233
How did it go?

4
00:00:08,233 --> 00:00:09,262
Not so good.

5
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:12,399
He walked me home and said, ''Let's do this again.''

6
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:16,380
He said, ''Let's do this again.'' That's good, right?

7
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:22,209
Translated, ''Let's do this again'' means, ''You'll never see me naked.''

8
00:00:23,287 --> 00:00:24,379
Since when?

9
00:00:25,222 --> 00:00:28,282
Since always. It's, like, dating language.

10
00:00:28,326 --> 00:00:31,386
Like, ''It's not you'' means, ''It is you.''

11
00:00:33,197 --> 00:00:39,226
''You're nice'' means, ''I'll be dating alcoholics and complaining about them to you.''

13
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:42,331
''We should see other people'' means:

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,305
''Ha-ha, I already am!''

15
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,302
Everybody knows this?

16
00:00:48,312 --> 00:00:49,336
Cushions the blow.

17
00:00:49,413 --> 00:00:54,342
Like your parents putting the dog to sleep and saying it went to a farm.

19
00:00:54,418 --> 00:01:01,382
That's funny. Because our parents actually did send our dog off to live on a farm.

21
00:01:02,193 --> 00:01:03,353
Ross?

22
00:01:05,196 --> 00:01:07,391
Hello! The Milner's farm in Connecticut?

23
00:01:08,165 --> 00:01:10,292
The Milners had this unbelievable farm.

24
00:01:10,368 --> 00:01:13,201
They had horses and rabbits to chase.

25
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:14,396
And it was....

26
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:20,200
Oh, my God! Chi-Chi!

27
00:02:13,264 --> 00:02:16,199
How does it feel knowing you're about to die?

28
00:02:16,267 --> 00:02:19,361
Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over.

29
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:24,369
But you'll live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.

30
00:02:26,177 --> 00:02:28,202
That was really good!

31
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:30,179
Thanks. Let's keep going.

32
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:34,217
So, what do you want from me, Dimon? Huh?

33
00:02:36,387 --> 00:02:40,380
I just wanna go back to my cell, because in my cell I can smoke.

34
00:02:41,192 --> 00:02:43,183
Smoke away!

35
00:02:55,506 --> 00:02:59,306
I think this is why Dimon smokes in his cell alone.

36
00:03:00,244 --> 00:03:01,256
What?

37
00:03:01,256 --> 00:03:02,268
Relax your hand.

38
00:03:02,346 --> 00:03:04,280
Let your wrist go.

39
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:06,248
Not so much!

40
00:03:07,351 --> 00:03:10,149
All right. Now take a puff.

41
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:12,152
Right.

42
00:03:14,191 --> 00:03:15,721
Give it to me.

43
00:03:15,721 --> 00:03:17,251
I'm not giving you a cigarette.

44
00:03:17,294 --> 00:03:21,253
It's fine. Do you want to get this part or not? Here.

45
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:24,357
Now, don't think of it as a cigarette.

46
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:29,202
Think of it as the thing that has been missing from your hand.

47
00:03:29,373 --> 00:03:31,398
When you hold it, you feel right.

48
00:03:32,276 --> 00:03:33,265
You feel complete.

49
00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:35,275
You miss it?

50
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:36,372
No, not so much.

51
00:03:38,182 --> 00:03:41,174
All right. Now we smoke.

52
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,212
Oh, my God!

53
00:03:46,323 --> 00:03:47,307
Give me that!

54
00:03:47,307 --> 00:03:48,291
No. You've got options.

55
00:03:48,392 --> 00:03:50,223
You can smoke like this:

56
00:03:50,294 --> 00:03:51,340
Chandler--

57
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,386
Or hold it in your mouth.

58
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:54,226
Give me the cigarette!

59
00:03:54,331 --> 00:03:54,911
You try.

60
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:55,491
Thank you.

61
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:58,292
Okay, how's this?

62
00:04:01,138 --> 00:04:03,163
Okay, that's not bad.

63
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,267
All right, when you're finished, it's cool if you flick it.

64
00:04:09,246 --> 00:04:15,250
All right, you keep practicing and I'll go put out the sofa.

66
00:04:19,256 --> 00:04:21,281
I thought it was foot size.

67
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:28,297
No. It's the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.

69
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,361
That's ridiculous.

70
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:39,267
Can I use either thumb?

71
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:42,270
I'd rather go with the foot theory.

72
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:45,371
All right. Don't tell me.

73
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:49,377
Decaf cappuccino for Joey.

74
00:04:51,222 --> 00:04:53,190
Coffee, black.

75
00:04:53,424 --> 00:04:56,188
Latte.

76
00:04:57,228 --> 00:04:58,320
And an iced tea.

77
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,697
I'm getting good at this.

78
00:05:00,697 --> 00:05:02,164
Excellent!

79
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:03,325
Good for me!

80
00:05:17,348 --> 00:05:18,764
You okay, Phoebe?

81
00:05:18,764 --> 00:05:20,180
It's not worth--

82
00:05:20,284 --> 00:05:21,444
It's my bank.

83
00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:23,215
What did they do?

84
00:05:23,215 --> 00:05:24,244
It's nothing--

85
00:05:24,355 --> 00:05:28,189
I get my mail and open their monthly ''statement.''

86
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:30,192
Easy!

87
00:05:31,462 --> 00:05:34,363
And there's $500 extra in my account.

88
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:38,292
Satan's minions at work again!

89
00:05:38,402 --> 00:05:41,269
Now I have to go deal with them--

90
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:43,284
What are you talking about? Keep it!

91
00:05:43,284 --> 00:05:45,263
It's not mine.

92
00:05:45,376 --> 00:05:47,310
If I kept it, I'd be stealing.

93
00:05:47,378 --> 00:05:51,212
But if you spent it, it would be like shopping.

94
00:05:53,284 --> 00:05:55,411
Say I bought a great pair of shoes.

95
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,123
Know what I'd hear with every step? ''Not mine. Not mine. Not mine.''

96
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:04,251
Even if I was happy and skipping, I'd hear:

97
00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:07,263
''Not-not mine. Not-not mine.''

98
00:06:07,331 --> 00:06:09,231
We're with you. We got it.

99
00:06:10,334 --> 00:06:14,327
I'd never be able to enjoy it. It'd be this giant karmic debt.

100
00:06:14,371 --> 00:06:16,362
Chandler, what are you doing?

101
00:06:17,274 --> 00:06:19,265
What are you doing?

102
00:06:21,378 --> 00:06:24,279
Oh, gross!

103
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:25,814
What is this?

104
00:06:25,814 --> 00:06:27,247
I'm smoking!

105
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:30,149
You've been so good for three years!

106
00:06:30,254 --> 00:06:33,246
And this is my reward.

107
00:06:34,258 --> 00:06:37,250
Think about what you went through when you quit.

108
00:06:37,361 --> 00:06:41,195
Forget about you. Think about what we went through!

109
00:06:41,265 --> 00:06:43,358
So this time I won't quit.

110
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,833
Put it out!

111
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,266
I'm putting it out!

112
00:06:47,371 --> 00:06:48,463
Oh, no!

113
00:06:49,206 --> 00:06:51,299
I can't drink this now.

114
00:06:55,312 --> 00:06:57,303
I'm gonna go. I've got a date.

115
00:06:57,414 --> 00:07:00,144
With Alan again? How's it going?

116
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,243
It's going pretty good. It's nice and we're having fun.

117
00:07:04,355 --> 00:07:06,323
When do we get to meet him?

118
00:07:06,357 --> 00:07:08,325
Let's see, it's Monday....

119
00:07:08,425 --> 00:07:09,340
Never.

120
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,255
Come on!

121
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:12,352
Not after what happened with Steve.

122
00:07:13,163 --> 00:07:17,327
What do you mean? We love Steve. Steve was sexy!

123
00:07:20,337 --> 00:07:21,326
Sorry.

124
00:07:21,438 --> 00:07:24,430
I don't know how I feel yet. Let me figure it out.

125
00:07:25,175 --> 00:07:27,143
Then can we meet him?

126
00:07:27,177 --> 00:07:28,166
No.

127
00:07:28,245 --> 00:07:30,145
Sorry.

128
00:07:32,282 --> 00:07:35,342
Joey. Let it go.

129
00:07:39,256 --> 00:07:40,348
Why should they meet him?

130
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:47,355
I bring a guy home and they're like coyotes picking off the weak members of the herd.

132
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:56,401
Listen, as someone who's seen more than her share of bad beef I'll tell you, that is not such a terrible thing.

134
00:07:57,174 --> 00:07:59,301
Your friends are just looking after you.

135
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:03,107
I wish that once I'd date a guy they liked.

136
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:08,732
You realize the odds of that happening are slimmer if they never get to meet the guy.

138
00:08:08,732 --> 00:08:10,313
I know.

139
00:08:10,354 --> 00:08:12,254
Can't I whimper a little bit?

140
00:08:12,254 --> 00:08:14,154
Whimper.

141
00:08:16,126 --> 00:08:17,423
Okay, I'm done.

142
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:20,253
Let it go, Ross.

143
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:23,131
You didn't know Chi-Chi.

144
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:28,303
Do you all promise?

145
00:08:28,303 --> 00:08:29,435
We promise.

146
00:08:30,174 --> 00:08:31,163
We'll be good.

147
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:34,335
Chandler, do you promise to be good?

148
00:08:42,152 --> 00:08:46,248
You can come in, but your filter-tip buddy stays outside!

149
00:08:55,432 --> 00:08:59,163
''Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling.

150
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:12,110
We've credited you $500. We're sorry for the inconvenience and hope you'll accept this football phone...as our gift.'' Do you believe it?

153
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:15,209
Now I have $1000 and a football phone.

154
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,112
What bank is this?

155
00:09:20,224 --> 00:09:22,317
Okay, it's him.

156
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:25,151
-Who is it?
-Alan.

157
00:09:25,229 --> 00:09:27,129
Chandler! He's here!

158
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:31,156
Do I look okay?

159
00:09:32,135 --> 00:09:33,227
One more button.

160
00:09:33,337 --> 00:09:35,271
Closed! How about closed?

161
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,307
I didn't know.

162
00:09:37,307 --> 00:09:38,274
Yeah.

163
00:09:39,443 --> 00:09:41,343
Please be good.

164
00:09:41,378 --> 00:09:44,347
Remember how much you all like me?

165
00:09:46,183 --> 00:09:50,347
Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.

166
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:57,385
I've heard so much about all you guys.

167
00:10:04,368 --> 00:10:07,269
I'll call you tomorrow. Thanks.

168
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:14,268
Let's let the Alan-bashing begin.

169
00:10:14,378 --> 00:10:17,211
Who's gonna take the first shot?

170
00:10:18,282 --> 00:10:19,306
Come on!

171
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:22,285
I'll go.

172
00:10:24,321 --> 00:10:26,414
Let's start with how he kept picking--

173
00:10:27,224 --> 00:10:30,284
I'm sorry, I can't do this. We loved him.

174
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:32,328
We loved him!

175
00:10:32,396 --> 00:10:36,298
Wait! We're talking about someone I'm going out with?

176
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,197
That pimento trick!

177
00:10:38,302 --> 00:10:41,328
I'll never look at an olive the same way again.

178
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:43,303
And did you notice?

179
00:10:48,345 --> 00:10:51,314
Know what was great? His smile was crooked.

180
00:10:51,415 --> 00:10:53,411
Yes! Like the man in the shoe!

181
00:10:53,411 --> 00:10:55,407
What shoe?

182
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,312
From the rhyme.

183
00:10:58,422 --> 00:11:00,287
There was a man With a crooked smile

184
00:11:00,357 --> 00:11:04,191
Who lived in a shoe For a while

185
00:11:06,363 --> 00:11:13,260
So I think Alan is the yardstick by which future boyfriends will be measured.

187
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,359
Future boyfriends?

188
00:11:15,172 --> 00:11:16,719
I think this could be ''it.''

189
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:18,266
Really?

190
00:11:18,308 --> 00:11:22,267
I'd marry him for his David Hasselhoff impression alone.

191
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:25,281
You know I'll be doing that at parties.

192
00:11:29,186 --> 00:11:30,249
Know what I like most?

193
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:31,312
What?

194
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:35,383
The way he makes me feel about myself.

195
00:11:57,447 --> 00:11:59,438
How was the game?

196
00:12:00,183 --> 00:12:01,275
Well....

197
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:04,252
We won!

198
00:12:05,188 --> 00:12:08,157
Fantastic! Question. How is that possible?

199
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,205
Alan.

200
00:12:10,205 --> 00:12:11,251
He was unbelievable!

201
00:12:11,294 --> 00:12:15,196
Like the cartoon where Bugs Bunny plays every position.

202
00:12:15,265 --> 00:12:19,361
It was first base, Alan. Second base, Alan....

203
00:12:23,173 --> 00:12:25,403
It was like he made us into a team.

204
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:31,170
We sure showed those Hasidic jewelers a thing or two about softball.

205
00:12:32,215 --> 00:12:33,477
Can I ask a question?

206
00:12:34,217 --> 00:12:36,310
Do you think Alan is sometimes....

207
00:12:36,386 --> 00:12:37,375
What?

208
00:12:37,487 --> 00:12:40,320
I don't know. A little too ''Alan''?

209
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:44,292
Oh, no. Not possible. You can never be too ''Alan.''

210
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:49,287
It's his innate ''Alan-ness'' that we adore.

211
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:52,324
I, personally, could have a gallon of Alan.

212
00:13:00,177 --> 00:13:01,223
Hey, Lizzy.

213
00:13:01,223 --> 00:13:02,269
Hey, weird girl.

214
00:13:03,246 --> 00:13:04,292
I brought alphabet soup.

215
00:13:04,292 --> 00:13:05,338
Pick out the vowels?

216
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:09,141
I left in the Y's. Because, ''sometimes Y.''

217
00:13:10,253 --> 00:13:11,299
And something else.

218
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:12,345
Saltines?

219
00:13:12,456 --> 00:13:15,186
No, $1000 and a football phone.

220
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,183
What?

221
00:13:18,261 --> 00:13:19,387
Oh, my God!

222
00:13:20,197 --> 00:13:21,294
There's really money in here.

223
00:13:21,294 --> 00:13:22,391
I know.

224
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,360
What are you doing?

225
00:13:25,168 --> 00:13:28,296
I want you to have it. I don't want it.

226
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:29,901
I have to give you something.

227
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:31,397
No, you don't--

228
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:33,790
Do you want my tinfoil hat?

229
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,371
No, you need that.

230
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:36,929
It's okay. Thanks.

231
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:38,379
Let me do something.

232
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:44,210
I'll tell you what. Buy me a soda and we're even. Okay?

233
00:13:45,222 --> 00:13:45,819
Okay.

234
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:46,416
Okay.

235
00:14:48,285 --> 00:14:50,276
Keep the change.

236
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,309
Thanks, Lizzy.

237
00:14:51,388 --> 00:14:52,412
Want a pretzel?

238
00:14:53,223 --> 00:14:54,707
No, I'm fine. Thanks.

239
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:56,191
See you.

240
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:06,226
A thumb?

241
00:15:07,337 --> 00:15:14,240
I know. There it was, just floating like this tiny little hitchhiker.

243
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:19,238
Maybe it's a contest. Like ''collect all five.''

244
00:15:20,283 --> 00:15:21,767
Does anyone wanna see?

245
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:23,251
No, thanks!

246
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:26,381
Don't do that. Come on!

247
00:15:27,157 --> 00:15:29,352
It's worse than the thumb.

248
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:32,258
This is so unfair.

249
00:15:32,258 --> 00:15:33,355
Why is it unfair?

250
00:15:34,164 --> 00:15:36,359
So I have a flaw! Big deal!

251
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:39,362
Joey's knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?

252
00:15:39,402 --> 00:15:42,166
Ross, over-pronouncing every word.

253
00:15:42,205 --> 00:15:47,404
Monica, who snorts when she laughs. I mean, what the hell is that thing?

254
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:53,212
I accept those flaws. Why can't you accept me for this?

255
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:03,248
Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody, or just him?

256
00:16:06,229 --> 00:16:08,163
I could live without it.

257
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:16,162
Is it a little annoying? Or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?

258
00:16:18,341 --> 00:16:21,333
Don't listen to him. I think it's endearing.

259
00:16:22,145 --> 00:16:24,170
Oh, you do, do you?

260
00:16:30,253 --> 00:16:33,279
There's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.

261
00:16:33,456 --> 00:16:36,289
Indeed there isn't.

262
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:40,261
I should get back to work.

263
00:16:40,363 --> 00:16:44,265
Otherwise someone might get what they ordered.

264
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:50,296
The hair comes out and the gloves come off.

265
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:08,313
Ever go out with a guy your friends really like?

266
00:17:08,358 --> 00:17:10,258
No.

267
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:16,160
I'm going out with a guy my friends really like.

268
00:17:16,232 --> 00:17:19,224
Are we talking about the coyotes here?

269
00:17:19,336 --> 00:17:23,238
All right! A cow got through.

270
00:17:24,174 --> 00:17:25,232
Can you believe it?

271
00:17:25,342 --> 00:17:27,207
It's just, you know what?

272
00:17:27,277 --> 00:17:30,212
I just don't feel the ''thing.''

273
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,147
They feel the thing. I don't feel it.

274
00:17:33,249 --> 00:17:38,186
Honey, you should always feel the thing.

275
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:44,190
If that's how you feel about the guy, dump him.

276
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,824
It's gonna be really hard.

277
00:17:45,824 --> 00:17:47,388
He'll get over it.

278
00:17:48,164 --> 00:17:53,158
No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.

279
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:55,265
Don't you respect your body?

280
00:17:55,265 --> 00:17:57,261
Don't you see what you're doing?

281
00:17:57,374 --> 00:18:01,242
I've had it with your cancer, emphysema and heart disease.

282
00:18:02,112 --> 00:18:06,105
The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.

283
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:11,253
Alan wants to speak to you.

284
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:13,346
Really? He does?

285
00:18:14,357 --> 00:18:17,258
Hey, buddy! What's up?

286
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:21,120
She told you about that, huh?

287
00:18:21,364 --> 00:18:26,131
Well, yeah. I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now.

288
00:18:27,137 --> 00:18:28,365
It's not that--

289
00:18:30,373 --> 00:18:32,341
Well, that's true.

290
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:39,172
Gee, you know, no one's ever put it like that before.

291
00:18:39,282 --> 00:18:42,149
Well, okay. Thanks.

292
00:18:51,394 --> 00:18:54,158
God, he's good.

293
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:56,315
If only he were a woman.

294
00:18:56,315 --> 00:18:58,266
Yeah.

295
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:04,295
Lamb Chop!

296
00:19:05,108 --> 00:19:08,134
How old is that sock?

297
00:19:08,244 --> 00:19:12,305
If I had a sock on my hand for 30 years, it'd be talking too.

298
00:19:14,317 --> 00:19:19,152
I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.

299
00:19:22,358 --> 00:19:23,842
Where's Joey?

300
00:19:23,842 --> 00:19:27,352
Joey ate my last stick of gum so I killed him.

302
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:30,256
Do you think that was wrong?

303
00:19:32,135 --> 00:19:33,232
I think he's across the hall.

304
00:19:33,232 --> 00:19:34,329
Thanks.

305
00:19:35,238 --> 00:19:37,229
There you go.

306
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,332
I'm alive with pleasure now.

307
00:19:40,376 --> 00:19:44,278
Pheebs, do you want the rest of that Pop-Tart?

308
00:19:45,381 --> 00:19:48,350
Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?

309
00:19:50,186 --> 00:19:52,154
Hey, I might.

310
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:54,246
I'm sorry.

311
00:19:54,357 --> 00:19:59,158
The soda people gave me $ 7000 for the thumb.

312
00:20:00,296 --> 00:20:03,356
And on my way over here I stepped in gum.

313
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:06,292
What is up with the universe?

314
00:20:06,402 --> 00:20:08,398
What's going on?

315
00:20:08,398 --> 00:20:10,394
It's just nice when we're together.

316
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:14,301
It's nicer when everyone gets to wear underwear.

317
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,184
Please, guys, we have to talk.

318
00:20:27,223 --> 00:20:29,487
Wait! I'm getting a déjà vu.

319
00:20:30,226 --> 00:20:31,284
No, I'm not.

320
00:20:34,197 --> 00:20:35,693
We have to talk.

321
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,189
There it is!

322
00:20:39,402 --> 00:20:41,336
Okay, it's about Alan.

323
00:20:41,404 --> 00:20:46,239
Speaking of which, tell him we're on for the Renaissance Fair.

324
00:20:46,342 --> 00:20:50,403
Before you get into that, there's something you should know.

325
00:20:51,314 --> 00:20:55,250
There's really no easy way to say this.

326
00:20:56,352 --> 00:20:59,412
I've decided to break up with Alan.

327
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:06,160
Is there somebody else?

328
00:21:07,463 --> 00:21:12,464
No, it's just you know, things change. People change.

330
00:21:13,203 --> 00:21:15,296
We didn't change.

331
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:20,399
So that's it? It's over?

332
00:21:21,277 --> 00:21:23,268
Just like that?

333
00:21:24,314 --> 00:21:29,377
You let your guard down. You start to care about someone, and....

334
00:21:32,422 --> 00:21:33,804
I can go on pretending--

335
00:21:33,804 --> 00:21:35,186
Okay!

336
00:21:35,225 --> 00:21:36,283
No.

337
00:21:36,326 --> 00:21:39,386
That wouldn't be fair to me, Alan, or to you.

338
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:41,420
Well, who wants fair?

339
00:21:42,198 --> 00:21:46,225
I just want things back, you know, the way they were.

340
00:21:48,238 --> 00:21:50,268
I'm sorry.

341
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:52,298
Oh, she's sorry. I feel better.

342
00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:55,240
I can't believe this!

343
00:21:55,311 --> 00:22:00,248
With the holidays coming up. I wanted him to meet my family.

344
00:22:01,251 --> 00:22:04,186
I'll meet someone. There'll be other Alans.

345
00:22:04,254 --> 00:22:05,278
Yeah, right!

346
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,211
Are you guys gonna be okay?

347
00:22:12,211 --> 00:22:14,162
We'll be fine.

348
00:22:14,197 --> 00:22:16,358
We're just gonna need a little time.

349
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:19,392
I understand.

350
00:22:24,374 --> 00:22:25,773
Wow.

351
00:22:25,773 --> 00:22:27,172
I'm really sorry.

352
00:22:27,277 --> 00:22:30,269
Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry too.

353
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,893
But I'm a little relieved.

354
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,406
Relieved?

355
00:22:34,217 --> 00:22:37,380
Yeah, well, I mean, I had a great time with you.

356
00:22:38,288 --> 00:22:41,223
I just can't stand your friends.

357
00:22:47,196 --> 00:22:50,427
Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?

358
00:22:52,335 --> 00:22:54,394
That was fun.

359
00:22:55,405 --> 00:22:58,397
He could row like a Viking.

360
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,243
So how'd it go?

361
00:23:09,452 --> 00:23:11,352
You know.

362
00:23:11,387 --> 00:23:14,185
Did he mention us?

363
00:23:18,261 --> 00:23:21,253
He says he's really gonna miss you guys.

364
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,786
Rough day, huh?

365
00:23:28,786 --> 00:23:30,202
You have no idea.

366
00:23:30,273 --> 00:23:32,264
Come here.

367
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:36,341
That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.

368
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:37,404
No!

369
00:23:38,181 --> 00:23:40,274
I don't care! I'm weak!

370
00:23:40,316 --> 00:23:42,284
I've gotta have the smoke!

371
00:23:42,385 --> 00:23:46,287
If you never smoke again, I'll give you $ 7000.

372
00:23:46,322 --> 00:23:48,290
Yeah, all right.
