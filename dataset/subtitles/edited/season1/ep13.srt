1
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:17,848
I'm sorry!

2
00:00:17,848 --> 00:00:19,247
That is it!

3
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:20,398
You barge in here

4
00:00:20,398 --> 00:00:21,444
and you don't knock?

5
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:23,819
You have no respect for privacy.

6
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:25,383
No, you wait!

7
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,857
Can I just say one thing?

8
00:00:26,857 --> 00:00:28,256
What?!

9
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:29,908
That's a relatively open weave.

10
00:00:29,908 --> 00:00:34,296
I can still see...your nippular areas.

12
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,851
Honey, tell them the story

13
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:31,889
about your patient who thinks things are

15
00:01:31,889 --> 00:01:33,288
other things.

16
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,927
When the phone rings

17
00:01:34,927 --> 00:01:36,394
and she takes a shower.

18
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:40,264
That's pretty much it.

19
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:43,852
But you tell it really well, sweetie.

20
00:01:43,852 --> 00:01:46,303
Thanks. Okay.

21
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,839
Now go away so we can

22
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:49,272
talk about you.

23
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,274
Okay. I'll miss you.

24
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,926
Isn't he great?

25
00:01:54,926 --> 00:01:56,473
He's cute. He likes you so much.

26
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,517
I know. He's so sweet.

27
00:01:58,517 --> 00:02:00,451
And so complicated, you know?

28
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,750
And for a shrink,

29
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,246
he's not too shrinky.

30
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:06,416
Think you'll do it on his couch?

31
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,394
I don't know. That's a little weird.

32
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,327
It's vinyl.

33
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:16,460
Okay, you guys want anything else?

34
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,851
Could I have--?

35
00:02:18,851 --> 00:02:20,432
We're all out. Anybody else?

36
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,274
Did I miss something?

37
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:24,906
No, she's still upset

38
00:02:24,906 --> 00:02:26,436
because I saw her boobies.

39
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,864
What were you doing

40
00:02:28,864 --> 00:02:30,348
seeing her boobies?

41
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,368
It was an accident. I wasn't

42
00:02:33,368 --> 00:02:36,286
across the street with a telescope.

43
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:39,291
Can we change the subject, please?

44
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:41,372
These aren't her ''boobies.''

45
00:02:41,372 --> 00:02:43,385
These are her breasts.

46
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,332
Pheebs, I was hoping

47
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,300
for more of a change.

48
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,360
I always liked ''Bazoombas.''

49
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,302
Gives them a Latin spin.

50
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:57,509
Can we drop this already, please?

51
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,395
Why are you embarrassed?

52
00:03:00,395 --> 00:03:02,312
They were very nice boobies.

53
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,249
''Nice''? They were ''nice''?

54
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,802
That's it?

55
00:03:07,802 --> 00:03:09,252
I mean, mittens are ''nice.''

56
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,418
Okay. Rock, hard place. Me.

57
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:22,458
You're so funny!

58
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,464
He's really funny.

59
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,289
I wouldn't wanna be there

60
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:29,240
when the laughter stops.

61
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:32,342
Whoa, back up there, sparky.

62
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,347
What did you mean by that?

63
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,011
It seems that maybe

64
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:41,264
you have intimacy issues that you use your humor

66
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:43,243
to keep people at a distance.

67
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,409
I mean, I just met you.

68
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:49,360
I don't know you from Adam.

69
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,352
Only child, right?

70
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:53,948
Parents divorced

71
00:03:53,948 --> 00:03:55,398
before you hit puberty.

72
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,903
How did you know that?

73
00:03:58,903 --> 00:04:00,336
It's textbook.

74
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,905
Hey, you guys.

75
00:04:04,905 --> 00:04:06,401
You all know my dad, right?

76
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,877
How long are you in the city?

77
00:04:08,877 --> 00:04:10,441
Two days. I got a job.

78
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,786
I'm better off staying with Joey than going back and forth

80
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:16,219
on the ferry.

81
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,818
I don't know this one.

82
00:04:17,818 --> 00:04:19,314
This is my friend Roger.

83
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,375
Good to meet you.

84
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,325
You too.

85
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,378
What happened to the puppet guy?

86
00:04:23,378 --> 00:04:25,329
Dad.

87
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:27,931
Oh, excuse me.

88
00:04:27,931 --> 00:04:30,331
So, Ross, how's the wife?

89
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,337
0 for 2, huh?

90
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,266
Chandler, say something funny.

91
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,285
I gotta go. Miss you too.

92
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,368
I love you, but it's getting late--

93
00:04:51,368 --> 00:04:53,347
Say hi. Hey, Ma.

94
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,410
I made the appointment

95
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,361
with Dr. Bassida and--

96
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:59,456
Excuse me?

97
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,328
Did you know this isn't Ma?

98
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,215
Her name's Ronni.

99
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,250
She's a pet mortician.

100
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,311
Sure.

101
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,325
So, how long you been...?

102
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,241
Remember when you were a kid,

103
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:33,254
I'd take you to the navy yard?

104
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,284
Since then?

105
00:05:35,284 --> 00:05:37,235
No, it's only been six years.

106
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,851
I wanted you to think of a nice memory

107
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:42,365
so you'd know I'm not a terrible guy.

108
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,390
What are you doing?

109
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,436
Chopping garlic.

110
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,344
You don't crush it?

111
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,848
You're having an affair,

112
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:53,248
I chop garlic. It's a wacky world.

113
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,379
Joe, you ever been in love?

114
00:05:58,391 --> 00:05:59,841
I don't know.

115
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:01,291
Then you haven't.

116
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,691
You're burning tomatoes.

117
00:06:03,691 --> 00:06:05,187
You're one to talk.

118
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,897
Your dad's in love. The worst part is,

119
00:06:09,897 --> 00:06:12,394
it's with two different women.

120
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,972
Oh, man! Please tell me

121
00:06:13,972 --> 00:06:15,439
one of them is Ma.

122
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,238
Of course one of them's Ma.

123
00:06:18,238 --> 00:06:20,234
What's the matter with you?

124
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,836
It's like if you woke up

125
00:06:28,836 --> 00:06:32,415
and found out your dad leads this double life.

127
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:34,454
He's like actually some spy

128
00:06:34,454 --> 00:06:36,450
working for the CIA.

129
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,455
That'd be cool.

130
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,229
This blows!

131
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,461
Do you think Dad cheated?

132
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,350
I don't think so.

133
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,430
That would involve sex.

134
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,787
I'd like to think that our parents

135
00:06:48,787 --> 00:06:50,334
don't do that.

136
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,843
I know. Why can't parents

137
00:06:55,843 --> 00:06:57,339
just stay parents?

138
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,418
Why do they have to become people?

139
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,386
Why do they have--?

140
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:06,838
Why...can't you stop staring

142
00:07:06,838 --> 00:07:08,385
at my breasts?

143
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,287
What?

144
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,424
What?

145
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:18,302
Didn't you get a good enough look?

146
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,452
We're all adults here.

147
00:07:20,452 --> 00:07:22,500
There's only one way to resolve this.

148
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,290
Since you saw her boobies you have

149
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,338
to show her your pee-pee.

150
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,320
You know,

151
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,417
I don't see that happening.

152
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,452
Come on. He's right. Tit for tat.

153
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:50,266
Well, I'm not showing you my tat!

154
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,403
-It's Phoebe.

155
00:07:55,403 --> 00:07:56,466
-And Rog!

156
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,333
Come on up.

157
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:02,278
Oh, good! Rog is here.

158
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,283
What's the matter with Rog?

159
00:08:06,283 --> 00:08:09,184
It's a little thing. I hate that guy!

160
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,339
So he was a little analytical.

161
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:13,290
That's what he does.

162
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,292
Come on, he's not that bad.

163
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:19,847
You're wrong! Why would I marry her if I thought that she was

165
00:08:19,847 --> 00:08:21,297
a lesbian?

166
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,848
I don't know. Maybe you wanted

167
00:08:23,848 --> 00:08:25,395
your marriage to fail.

168
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,212
Why? Why would I--? Why?

169
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:39,207
I don't know. Maybe low self-esteem?

170
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,383
Maybe to compensate

171
00:08:41,383 --> 00:08:43,448
for overshadowing a sibling. Maybe--

172
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:46,418
Wait! Go back to that ''sibling'' thing.

173
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:49,257
Well, I don't know.

174
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:50,841
You could've sabotaged

175
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:54,399
your marriage so the sibling would feel like

177
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,333
less of a failure.

178
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,185
That's ridiculous!

179
00:09:02,185 --> 00:09:04,164
I don't feel guilty for her failures.

180
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:08,276
You think I'm a failure?

181
00:09:08,276 --> 00:09:09,373
Isn't he good?

182
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:11,298
Yeah. No, that's not

183
00:09:11,298 --> 00:09:13,181
what I was saying.

184
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:15,220
I thought you were on my side.

185
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:17,272
But maybe you sucked up

186
00:09:17,272 --> 00:09:19,223
to them so they'd favor you.

187
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,243
I married a lesbian

188
00:09:21,243 --> 00:09:23,194
to make you look good!

189
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,401
You're right. I mean, you're right.

190
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,414
It wasn't just the Weebles,

191
00:09:31,414 --> 00:09:40,423
but the Weeble Play Palace...and the Weeble's Cruise Ship with this lifeboat

194
00:09:40,423 --> 00:09:42,402
for the Weebles to wobble in.

195
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,310
And Mom just gave them all away.

196
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:50,354
That's tough, tough stuff.

197
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,339
Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie,

198
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:54,222
we gotta go.

199
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,278
Feel better.

200
00:09:56,278 --> 00:09:58,229
We're gonna be late, sweetie.

201
00:09:58,264 --> 00:09:59,748
Thanks for everything, Mon.

202
00:09:59,748 --> 00:10:01,232
No problem.

203
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,359
Listen, it was great seeing you again.

204
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:08,468
Mon, easy on those cookies, okay?

205
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:10,839
Remember, they're just food,

206
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:12,437
they're not love.

207
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,544
I hate that guy!

208
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,479
Good night, you guys.

209
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:29,386
Oh, look. It's the woman we ordered.

210
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,491
Hey, can we help you?

211
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,865
No, thanks. I'm just waiting

212
00:10:37,865 --> 00:10:39,361
for Joey Tribbiani.

213
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:42,365
I'm Joey Tribbiani.

214
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:47,402
Oh, no, not you. Big Joey. Oh, my God!

215
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,930
You're so much cuter than

216
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,380
your pictures.

217
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,382
I'm Ronni.

218
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,514
Cheese Nip?

219
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,323
Joey's having an embolism,

220
00:11:03,323 --> 00:11:05,319
but I'd go for a nip.

221
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:12,853
Most people,

222
00:11:12,853 --> 00:11:17,241
when their pets pass on want them like they're sleeping.

224
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,339
Occasionally you get a person

225
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:21,335
who wants them in a pose.

226
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,439
Like chasing their tail.

227
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:27,480
Or jumping to catch a Frisbee.

228
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,422
Joey, if I go first,

229
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:32,390
I wanna be looking for my keys.

230
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,457
That's a good one!

231
00:11:34,457 --> 00:11:35,355
Hey.

232
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,486
Hey, Dad. Ronni's here.

233
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,292
Hi.

234
00:11:39,292 --> 00:11:40,287
Hey.

235
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:45,269
Hello, babe! What are you doing here?

236
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:48,272
Oh, you left your hair at my place.

237
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,467
I thought you'd need it tomorrow.

238
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,379
Thank you.

239
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:57,865
So, who's up for a big

240
00:11:57,865 --> 00:11:59,315
game of IKerplunk?

241
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,414
Look, I shouldn't have come.

242
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,257
I better go. I'll miss the train.

243
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,341
I don't want you taking that thing.

244
00:12:11,341 --> 00:12:13,354
Where do I stay? Here?

245
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,425
We'll go to a hotel.

246
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,238
We'll go to a hotel.

247
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:21,457
No, you won't.

248
00:12:21,457 --> 00:12:22,441
No, we won't.

249
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:24,372
If you go to a hotel,

250
00:12:24,372 --> 00:12:25,469
you'll be doing stuff.

251
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:27,410
I want you here so I can

252
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,542
keep an eye on you.

253
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,777
You're gonna keep an eye on us?

254
00:12:30,777 --> 00:12:32,273
Right.

255
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:37,380
As long as you are under my roof you're gonna live by my rules.

257
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,425
That means no sleeping

258
00:12:42,425 --> 00:12:43,557
with your girlfriend.

259
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:47,364
Wow, he's strict.

260
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,479
Dad, you'll be in my room.

261
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:51,458
You can stay in Chandler's room.

262
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,472
And Chandler will be?

263
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:56,364
Out here with me, bunking up.

264
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,841
Oh, bunking up. If you smell s'mores,

265
00:12:58,841 --> 00:13:01,207
don't be alarmed.

266
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,408
Thanks. You're a good kid.

267
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,440
I'll show you to my room.

268
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,387
That sounds weird not followed by,

269
00:13:09,387 --> 00:13:11,355
''No, it's late.''

270
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,924
This is just for tonight.

271
00:13:17,924 --> 00:13:20,421
Tomorrow you gotta change.

272
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,455
Change?

273
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,252
Break up with Ronni--

274
00:13:23,252 --> 00:13:24,236
I can't!

275
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:25,832
Then come clean with Ma!

276
00:13:25,832 --> 00:13:27,328
This is not right!

277
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:28,855
I don't wanna hear it!

278
00:13:28,855 --> 00:13:30,271
Now go to my room!

279
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,482
Hey, kickie!

280
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,827
What are you doing?

281
00:13:49,827 --> 00:13:51,260
Getting comfortable.

282
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:52,910
I can't sleep in my underwear.

283
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,457
Well, you're gonna.

284
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,721
I was thinking about how I'm always

285
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:06,235
seeing girls on top of girls....

286
00:14:08,447 --> 00:14:10,330
Are they end-to-end,

287
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,213
or tall, like pancakes?

288
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,410
You know, how I date all these women.

289
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,718
I always figured, when the right one

290
00:14:17,718 --> 00:14:22,317
comes along I'll be able to go the distance.

292
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,228
Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking--

293
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,356
You're not him, you're you.

294
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,346
When they wanted you in

295
00:14:30,346 --> 00:14:32,325
your father's business, did you cave?

296
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:32,932
No.

297
00:14:32,932 --> 00:14:33,426
No.

298
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:35,406
You chose

299
00:14:35,406 --> 00:14:37,340
the out-of-work-actor business.

300
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,370
That wasn't easy, but you did it.

301
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,764
I believe when the right woman

302
00:14:42,764 --> 00:14:46,818
comes along you'll have the guts to say,

304
00:14:46,818 --> 00:14:49,286
''No, thanks, I'm married.''

305
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,411
You really think so?

306
00:14:56,411 --> 00:14:58,362
Yeah, I really do.

307
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,364
Thanks, Chandler.

308
00:14:59,364 --> 00:15:00,331
Get off!

309
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:14,279
Hi.

310
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,246
Hi. May I help you?

311
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,811
Joey said I could use your shower

312
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:20,308
since Chandler's in ours.

313
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,216
Okay. Who are you?

314
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,416
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rapalono.

315
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,259
The mistress?

316
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:30,859
Come on in.

317
00:15:30,859 --> 00:15:31,456
Thanks.

318
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,232
I'm Rachel. Bathroom's there.

319
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,880
Ronni, how long has Chandler

320
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,427
been in the shower?

321
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,437
Oh, like five minutes.

322
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:42,235
Perfect.

323
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,306
Fasten your seat belts,

324
00:15:46,306 --> 00:15:48,336
it's pee-pee time.

325
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,965
Hey, Mr. Trib.

326
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:56,478
Hey, good morning, dear.

327
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,391
Chandler Bing,

328
00:16:00,391 --> 00:16:02,325
it's time to see your thing.

329
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,887
What's with you?

330
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:17,434
I thought it was Chandler!

331
00:16:18,243 --> 00:16:19,841
You were supposed to be in there

332
00:16:19,841 --> 00:16:21,439
so I'd see your thing!

333
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:26,250
Sorry, my thing was in there with me.

334
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,255
How's it going?

335
00:16:36,255 --> 00:16:37,250
Good.

336
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,394
Roger's having a dinner thing.

337
00:16:39,394 --> 00:16:41,459
He wanted me to invite you guys.

338
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,352
So, what's going on?

339
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:47,467
Nothing.

340
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,262
It's just....

341
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,367
It's Roger, you know?

342
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,378
There's something about--

343
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,471
We just feel that he's....

344
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,346
We hate that guy!

345
00:16:58,346 --> 00:16:59,443
We hate him!

346
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,299
We're sorry, Pheebs.

347
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:02,379
Okay.

348
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,338
Don't you think it's just that

349
00:17:04,338 --> 00:17:08,223
he's so perceptive it freaked you out?

351
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,227
No, we hate him!

352
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,387
I'm sorry.

353
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,741
Ma! What are you doing here?

354
00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:30,272
I came to give you this and this!

355
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,281
Big ring!

356
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,898
Why'd you fill your father's head

357
00:17:33,898 --> 00:17:38,246
with garbage about making things right?

359
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:40,415
Things were fine this way!

360
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,421
There's chicken in there. Put it away.

361
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,424
For God's sake, Joey! Really.

362
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:51,398
Hold on. You knew?

363
00:17:51,398 --> 00:17:53,428
Of course I knew. What do you think?

364
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,530
Your father is no James Bond.

365
00:17:56,308 --> 00:17:58,299
You should've heard his stories.

366
00:17:58,444 --> 00:17:59,809
''I'm sleeping over

367
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:01,174
at my accountant's.''

368
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,226
What is that? Please!

369
00:18:03,226 --> 00:18:05,239
So then, how could you--?

370
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,767
Do you remember

371
00:18:06,767 --> 00:18:08,217
how your father used to be?

372
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:09,834
Always yelling.

373
00:18:09,834 --> 00:18:11,381
Nothing made him happy.

374
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,874
Not that wood shop, not those

375
00:18:13,874 --> 00:18:16,325
stupid little ships in the bottle.

376
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,811
Now he's happy. I mean, it's nice.

377
00:18:18,811 --> 00:18:21,194
He has a hobby.

378
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,898
Ma, I don't mean

379
00:18:24,898 --> 00:18:28,756
to be disrespectful but what the hell

381
00:18:28,756 --> 00:18:30,206
are you talking about?

382
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,293
I mean, what about you?

383
00:18:32,293 --> 00:18:34,244
Me? I'm fine.

384
00:18:34,313 --> 00:18:40,398
Look, honey, in an ideal world there'd be no her and your father

386
00:18:40,398 --> 00:18:42,446
would look like Sting.

387
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,355
And something else:

388
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,341
Ever since that

389
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:51,393
poodle-stuffer came along he's so ashamed of himself

391
00:18:51,393 --> 00:18:53,458
that he's been more attentive.

392
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,298
He's been more loving. It's like

393
00:18:56,298 --> 00:18:58,363
every day is our anniversary.

394
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,351
I'm happy for you?

395
00:19:00,351 --> 00:19:02,165
Well, don't be!

396
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,276
Now everything's screwed up.

397
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:11,177
I just want it the way it was.

398
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:14,218
Ma, I'm sorry.

399
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,849
I just did what

400
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:17,379
I thought you'd want.

401
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,258
I know you did, cookie.

402
00:19:20,258 --> 00:19:22,226
I know you did.

403
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:29,223
So tell me. Did you see her?

404
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:31,494
Yeah.

405
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,400
You're 10 times prettier than she is.

406
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,396
That's sweet.

407
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,337
Could I take her?

408
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:44,211
With this ring, no contest.

409
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:57,418
Oh, no! Don't ever do that!

410
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:58,343
What?

411
00:19:58,343 --> 00:19:59,224
I'm sorry.

412
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,878
I have a thing,

413
00:20:00,878 --> 00:20:02,425
which means you can't ever do that!

414
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,884
What's wrong, sweetie?

415
00:20:06,884 --> 00:20:08,431
Nothing.

416
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,338
No, what's wrong? Come on.

417
00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:11,435
Okay.

418
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,260
It's nothing. I'm fine.

419
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,239
It's just-- It's my friends.

420
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:26,256
They have a liking problem with you in that they don't.

422
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:30,483
They don't?

423
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,277
But they don't see all

424
00:20:34,277 --> 00:20:36,290
the wonderfulness that I see.

425
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,335
They don't see all the good

426
00:20:38,335 --> 00:20:40,269
and sweet stuff.

427
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:41,919
They think you're a little--

428
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,466
What?

429
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,305
Intense and creepy.

430
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,895
Oh.

431
00:20:49,895 --> 00:20:51,510
But I don't. Me, Phoebe.

432
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,402
I'm not at all surprised about that.

433
00:20:56,402 --> 00:20:58,518
That's why you're so great.

434
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:03,422
It's quite typical behavior when you have this kind

436
00:21:03,422 --> 00:21:05,418
of dysfunctional group dynamic.

437
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,296
You know, this kind of codependent,

438
00:21:08,296 --> 00:21:13,353
emotionally stunted sitting in your stupid coffeehouse,

440
00:21:13,353 --> 00:21:17,888
with your stupid big cups which might as well

442
00:21:17,888 --> 00:21:19,435
have nipples on them.

443
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,913
And you're all like,

444
00:21:22,913 --> 00:21:25,347
''Oh, define me! Define me!

445
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,351
Love me! I need love!''

446
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,388
You talked to your dad?

447
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,969
He's gonna keep cheating on Ma

448
00:21:32,969 --> 00:21:34,482
like she wanted.

449
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,357
Ma will keep pretending

450
00:21:36,357 --> 00:21:37,454
she doesn't know.

451
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,012
And my sister, Tina,

452
00:21:39,012 --> 00:21:40,462
can't see her husband.

453
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,490
He got a restraining order.

454
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,419
Which has nothing to do with it.

455
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:47,370
I found out today.

456
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,954
Things have changed here

457
00:21:49,954 --> 00:21:51,501
on Waltons' mountain.

458
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:54,874
So, Joey, are you okay?

459
00:21:54,874 --> 00:21:56,370
Yeah, I guess.

460
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,508
It's just-- You know, they're parents.

461
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,381
After a certain point,

462
00:22:00,381 --> 00:22:01,444
you gotta let go.

463
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,317
You gotta let them

464
00:22:04,317 --> 00:22:06,313
make their own mistakes.

465
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,358
And think, in a few years,

466
00:22:08,358 --> 00:22:10,258
we'll turn into them.

467
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,421
Oh, please.

468
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,896
If I turn into my parents, I'll be

469
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:19,428
an alcoholic blond chasing men or I'll end up like my mom!

471
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,271
Hey.

472
00:22:25,271 --> 00:22:26,266
Hey, Pheebs.

473
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,245
How's it going?

474
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,248
Okay, except I broke up with Roger.

475
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,415
Yeah, right.

476
00:22:34,415 --> 00:22:35,478
No, no, really.

477
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,888
What happened?

478
00:22:39,888 --> 00:22:43,875
I don't know. I mean he's a good person,

480
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:45,456
and he can be really sweet.

481
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,861
In some ways,

482
00:22:47,861 --> 00:22:49,357
I think he is so right for me.

483
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,494
It's just.... I hate that guy!

484
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:02,242
Hi, Joey. What's going on?

485
00:23:02,347 --> 00:23:03,780
Clear the tracks

486
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,213
for the boobie payback.

487
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,410
Next stop, Rachel Greene.

488
00:23:13,358 --> 00:23:15,417
Joey, what the hell were you doing?

489
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:18,421
Sorry, wrong boobies!

490
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,239
Hello, Joey!

491
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:35,437
Hello, dear!
