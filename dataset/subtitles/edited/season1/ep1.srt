1
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,486
There's nothing to tell. It's just some guy I work with.

2
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,228
You're going out with the guy.

3
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,455
There has to be something wrong with him.

4
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,256
All right, Joey. Be nice.

5
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,460
So does he have a hump and a hairpiece?

6
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,271
Wait, does he eat chalk?

7
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,434
I don't want her to go through what I did with Carl.

8
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:21,470
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date.

9
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:26,344
It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.

10
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:29,445
Sounds like a date to me.

11
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:37,354
I'm in high school, in the cafeteria and I realize I'm totally naked.

13
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,364
I've had that dream.

14
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:46,462
Then I look down and I realize there is a phone...there.

16
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:49,358
Instead of--

17
00:01:49,358 --> 00:01:50,308
That's right!

18
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,274
Never had that one.

19
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:56,476
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.

20
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,581
What do I do? Everyone starts looking at me.

21
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,414
They weren't looking at you before?

22
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:07,325
Finally, I figure I'd better answer it.

23
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:11,329
And it turns out it's my mother.

24
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:15,390
Which is very, very weird because she never calls me.

25
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,271
Hi.

26
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,246
He says, ''Hello,'' I want to kill myself.

27
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,271
You okay?

28
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:38,304
I feel like someone pulled my intestine out of my mouth and tied it around my neck.

30
00:02:38,304 --> 00:02:40,352
Cookie?

31
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,394
Carol moved her stuff out today.

32
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,976
Let me get you some coffee.

33
00:02:44,976 --> 00:02:46,489
Thanks.

34
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,364
No, don't! Stop cleansing my aura.

35
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,858
Just leave my aura alone, okay?

36
00:02:57,858 --> 00:03:00,241
Fine, be murky.

37
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,330
I'll be fine. I hope she'll be happy.

38
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,247
No, you don't.

39
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,445
No, I don't. To hell with her. She left me!

40
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,416
You never knew she was a lesbian?

41
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,228
No! Okay?

42
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,321
Why does everyone keep fixating on that?

43
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:24,334
She didn't know. How should I know?

44
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:29,330
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

45
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,268
Did I say that out loud?

46
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,282
I told Mom and Dad last night. They took it pretty well.

47
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,373
Oh, really?

48
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:48,292
So that hysterical phone call from a woman sobbing ''I'll never have grandchildren,'' was what? A wrong number?

50
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,350
Sorry.

51
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:53,364
Look, you're feeling a lot of pain right now.

52
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:56,299
You're angry. You're hurting.

53
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,462
Can I tell you what the answer is?

54
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,233
Strip joints!

55
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,401
Hey, you're single. Have some hormones.

56
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,209
But I don't want to be single, okay?

57
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:11,408
I just want to be married again.

58
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:19,419
And I just want a million dollars!

59
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,927
Rachel?

60
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:26,525
Oh, Monica! Thank God!

61
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:33,237
I went to your building and a guy with a hammer said you'd be here, and you are.

63
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,307
Can I get you some coffee?

64
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:37,275
Decaf.

65
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:41,345
Everybody, this is Rachel, a Lincoln High survivor.

66
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:46,341
This is everybody. Chandler and Phoebe Joey. Remember my brother, Ross?

68
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,476
Sure!

69
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:02,298
You want to tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

70
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:08,306
Well, it started about a half-hour before the wedding.

71
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:17,249
I was in the room with all the presents and I was looking at this really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.

73
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,217
When all of a sudden--

74
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,308
Sweet 'N Low?

75
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:26,414
I realized I was more turned on by this gravy boat than Barry.

76
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,427
I got freaked out, and it hit me:

77
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,424
How much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head.

78
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,460
I always knew he looked familiar, but....

79
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:46,377
I had to get out of there, and I started wondering ''Why am I doing this,'' and ''Who am I doing it for?''

81
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:54,252
I didn't know where to go, and I know we've drifted apart but you're the only person I know here.

83
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,902
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.

84
00:05:56,902 --> 00:05:59,450
I hoped that wouldn't be an issue.

85
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:21,202
I guess he bought her the pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.

86
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:24,315
''Tuna or egg salad! Decide!''

87
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:30,354
''I'll have whatever Christina's having.''

88
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:34,223
Daddy, I just-- I can't marry him.

89
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,320
I'm sorry. I just don't love him.

90
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:43,425
Well, it matters to me!

91
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:50,469
''If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.''

92
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:55,345
She should not be wearing those pants.

93
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,281
Push her down the stairs!

94
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,317
Push her! Push her down the stairs!

95
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,325
Come on, Daddy, listen!

96
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:12,290
All my life, everyone's always told me, ''You're a shoe!''

97
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:14,492
''You're a shoe!''

98
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:18,226
What if I don't want to be a shoe?

99
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:21,296
What if I want to be a purse?

100
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:24,240
Or a hat?

101
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,208
No, I don't want you to buy me a hat!

102
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:30,339
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

103
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,413
You can see where he'd have trouble.

104
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,255
Look, Daddy, it's my life.

105
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:43,259
Well, maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.

106
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,425
I guess we've established she's staying with Monica.

107
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:52,328
Well, maybe that's my decision.

108
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,463
Maybe I don't need your money.

109
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,276
Wait! I said maybe!

110
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,287
Just breathe. That's it.

111
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,188
Try to think of nice, calm things.

112
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,384
Raindrops on roses And whiskers on kittens

113
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:19,289
Doorbells and sleigh bells And something with mittens

114
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,430
La la la something And noodles with string

115
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,237
I'm all better now.

116
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,402
I helped.

117
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:34,242
This is probably for the best.

118
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:39,412
Independence. Controlling your life. The whole hat thing.

119
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:43,479
You can always come to Joey.

120
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,420
Me and Chandler live across the hall. He's away a lot.

121
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,261
Stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day.

122
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,423
Like there's a rule, or something?

123
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:00,199
I got it.

124
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,434
Please don't do that again. It's a horrible sound.

125
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,369
It's Paul.

126
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:09,272
Oh, God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in.

127
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,781
Who's Paul?

128
00:09:10,781 --> 00:09:12,180
Paul, the wine guy?

129
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,274
Maybe.

130
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:16,413
Your ''not a real date'' is with Paul, the wine guy?

131
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,252
He finally asked you out?

132
00:09:18,252 --> 00:09:19,315
Yes!

133
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,225
It's a ''Dear Diary'' moment.

134
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,842
Rach, I can cancel.

135
00:09:23,842 --> 00:09:25,389
Please, go, I'll be fine.

136
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,327
Ross, are you okay? Do you want me to stay?

137
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,337
That'd be good.

138
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,403
Really?

139
00:09:36,403 --> 00:09:38,399
Go on! It's Paul, the wine guy!

140
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,337
Does he sell it, drink it?

141
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,349
Or he just complains a lot?

142
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:50,414
Hi, come in! Paul, this is...everybody. Everybody, this is Paul.

144
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,337
The wine guy.

145
00:09:54,337 --> 00:09:56,316
I didn't catch your name. Paul?

146
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,256
I'll be right back. I've just gotta go--

147
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,427
A-wandering?

148
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,260
Change.

149
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,464
Sit down. Two seconds.

150
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:16,244
I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.

151
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,352
Hey, Paul, here's a tip.

152
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:30,261
She really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot until it starts to get red.

154
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,457
Shut up, Joey!

155
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,291
What are you up to tonight?

156
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:43,366
I was supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon so, nothing.

158
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,503
Right. You're not even getting your honeymoon.

159
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,510
Although, Aruba. This time of year?

160
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:57,285
Talk about your big lizards.

162
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:06,262
If you don't want to be alone tonight Joey and Chandler are helping me with my furniture.

164
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,459
We're very excited about it.

165
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:12,261
Thanks. But I'm just going to hang out here.

166
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,366
It's been a long day.

167
00:11:13,366 --> 00:11:14,361
Oh, sure.

168
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,236
Pheebs, wanna help?

169
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:20,277
I wish I could, but I don't want to.

170
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:34,293
Love is sweet as summer showers Love is a wondrous work of art

171
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:40,296
But your love Oh, your love, your love

172
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:44,462
Is like a giant pigeon

173
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,468
Crapping on my heart

174
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,278
Thank you.

175
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:08,455
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y thing to the side things using a bunch of these little worm guys.

177
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:17,464
I have no bracket-y thing. I see no worm guys whatsoever and I cannot feel my legs.

179
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,291
We got a bookcase.

180
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,242
It's beautiful.

181
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,241
What's this?

182
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,273
I would have to say that is an L-shaped bracket.

183
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,447
Which goes where?

184
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:36,443
I have no idea.

185
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:39,970
Done with the bookcase.

186
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,483
All finished.

187
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,290
This was Carol's favorite beer.

188
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:53,260
She always drank it out of the can. I should have known.

189
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,905
Start with that, we're out of here.

190
00:12:58,905 --> 00:13:01,402
Please don't spoil all this fun.

191
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,311
Let me ask you.

192
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:07,445
She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV.

193
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,448
What did you get?

194
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,735
You guys.

195
00:13:11,735 --> 00:13:13,248
You got screwed.

196
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,424
Oh, my God.

197
00:13:15,424 --> 00:13:17,523
I know. I'm such an idiot.

198
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:22,428
I should've known when she went to the dentist five times a week.

199
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,265
I mean, how clean can teeth get?

200
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,430
My brother's going through that.

201
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,366
How did you get over it?

202
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:33,275
He might accidentally break something valuable of hers.

203
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,311
Say her--

204
00:13:34,311 --> 00:13:35,243
Leg?

205
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:39,283
That's one way of doing it. I went for the watch.

206
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,352
You actually broke her watch?

207
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:46,449
The worst I ever did was shred my old boyfriend's favorite towel.

208
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,823
Steer clear of you.

209
00:13:48,823 --> 00:13:50,387
That's right.

210
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:54,266
Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

211
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:59,463
You probably think it's about making love with your socks on, but it isn't.

212
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,400
It's about me. And I just--

213
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:12,307
The machine cut me off again. Anyway....

214
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:22,250
I know that some lucky girl is going to become Mrs. Barry Finkel.

215
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:26,230
But it isn't me. It's not me.

216
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:30,428
Not that I have any idea who ''me'' is right now, but you just--

217
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,431
I'm divorced.

218
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,256
I'm only 26, and I'm divorced!

219
00:14:38,256 --> 00:14:41,271
Shut up!

220
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:48,282
That only took me an hour.

221
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:55,352
We haven't had a relationship that's lasted longer than a Mento.

222
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:00,322
You have had the love of a woman for four years.

223
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:06,201
Four years of closeness and sharing, after which she ripped your heart out.

224
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,230
That is why we don't do it!

225
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,336
I don't think that was my point!

226
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:17,439
Know what's scary? What if there's only one woman for everybody?

227
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,243
I mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it?

228
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,314
Unfortunately, in my case, there was only one woman for her.

229
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:31,421
What are you talking about? One woman.

230
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,459
That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream.

231
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:40,262
Let me tell you something. There's lots of flavors out there.

232
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:44,332
Rocky road and cookie dough and bing cherry vanilla.

233
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:49,371
You can get them with jimmies or nuts or whipped cream.

234
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,376
It's the best thing to happen to you!

235
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:56,443
You got married. You were like, what, 8?

236
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:01,291
Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon!

237
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,810
I don't know if I'm hungry or horny.

238
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,193
Then stay out of my freezer.

239
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,295
Ever since she walked out on me....

240
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,407
What?

241
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,301
You wanna spell it out with noodles?

242
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:23,313
It's more of a fifth date kind of revelation.

243
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:28,218
So there's going to be a fifth date?

244
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:29,447
Isn't there?

245
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,315
Yeah, yeah. I think there is.

246
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:37,252
What were you going to say?

247
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:49,339
Ever since she left me I haven't been able to perform sexually.

250
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:54,435
Oh, God! I'm so sorry.

251
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,281
Being spit on is probably not what you need right now.

252
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,216
How long?

253
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,817
Two years.

254
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:05,313
Wow.

255
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:09,384
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

256
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:15,323
So you still think you might want that fifth date?

257
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:21,229
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

258
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:37,217
We are gathered here to join Joanie Louise Cunningham and Charles. Chachi, Chachi, Chachi in the bonds of holy matrimony.

261
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,278
See!

262
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:44,353
But Joanie loved Chachi. That's the difference.

263
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,264
''Grab a spoon.''

264
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:50,426
Do you know how long it's been since I grabbed a spoon?

265
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:55,366
Do the words, ''Billy, don't be a hero,'' mean anything to you?

266
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,213
Great story. But I gotta go.

267
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:07,218
I got a date with Andrea. Angela. No, Andrea.

268
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:10,414
Andrea's the screamer. Angela has cats.

269
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,388
Right, thanks. It's Julie. I'm out of here.

270
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:26,236
Here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to ask a woman out who am I going to ask?

273
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:54,264
Isn't this amazing? I've never made coffee in my life.

274
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:55,412
That is amazing.

275
00:18:55,412 --> 00:18:56,458
Congratulations.

276
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:00,466
If I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.

277
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:06,367
I think it's, ''If I can invade Poland, there's nothing I can't do.''

278
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:11,314
If you feel like you have to make a Western omelet or something....

279
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,482
Although, actually I'm really not that hungry.

280
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:22,318
Oh, good. Lenny and Squiggy are here.

281
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,207
Good morning.

282
00:19:24,207 --> 00:19:25,219
Good morning.

283
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:28,216
Morning.

284
00:19:28,216 --> 00:19:29,200
Morning, Paul.

285
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,768
Hello, Paul.

286
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:32,235
Hi. Paul, is it?

287
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,778
Thank you so much.

288
00:19:40,778 --> 00:19:42,245
Stop.

289
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:49,413
Last night was like all my birthdays, both graduations plus the barn-raising scene in Witness.

291
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,520
We'll talk later.

292
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,528
Thank you.

293
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:14,337
That wasn't a real date.

294
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,439
What the hell do you do on a real date?

295
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,475
Shut up and put my table back.

296
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,355
I've got to get to work.

297
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:30,259
If I don't input those numbers, it doesn't make much of a difference.

298
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,459
So, like, you guys all have jobs?

299
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:41,399
Yeah, we all have jobs. That's how we buy stuff.

300
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,488
Yeah, I'm an actor.

301
00:20:45,488 --> 00:20:47,501
Have I seen you in anything?

302
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,373
I doubt it. Mostly regional work.

303
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:57,288
Unless you saw the Wee One's production of Pinocchio at the little theater in the park?

305
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,481
It was a job!

306
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,417
''Look, Geppetto. I'm a real live boy.''

307
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,342
I will not take this abuse.

308
00:21:06,342 --> 00:21:08,321
You're right, I'm sorry.

309
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,268
Once I was a wooden boy A little wooden boy

310
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:17,465
You should both know that he's a dead man.

311
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,234
Oh, Chandler!

312
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,440
How are you doing today? Sleep okay?

313
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:28,485
Did you talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.

314
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:33,384
I see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.

315
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:41,355
I know. He's just so....

316
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,984
Remember you and Tony Demarco?

317
00:21:42,984 --> 00:21:44,468
Oh, yeah.

318
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:48,405
Well, it's like that. With feelings.

319
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,892
Wow, are you in trouble!

320
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,376
Big time!

321
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:56,308
Want a wedding dress? Hardly used.

322
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:59,509
I think we're getting a little ahead of ourselves.

323
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:04,416
I'm going to get up, go to work, and not think about him all day.

324
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:08,416
Or else I'm going to get up and go to work.

325
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,410
Wish me luck!

326
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,360
What for?

327
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:15,230
I'm gonna go get one of those job things.

328
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,390
Hi, Monica.

329
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,436
Franny, welcome back.

330
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,394
How was Florida?

331
00:22:29,394 --> 00:22:31,242
You had sex, didn't you?

332
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,314
How do you do that?

333
00:22:34,314 --> 00:22:35,343
I hate you.

334
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:39,380
I'm pushing my aunt through Parrot Jungle, you're having sex.

335
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,484
So, who?

336
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,454
You know Paul?

337
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:48,357
Paul, the wine guy? Yeah, I know Paul.

338
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:53,367
You mean, you know Paul like I know Paul?

339
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,463
What? I take credit for Paul.

340
00:22:56,274 --> 00:23:00,233
Before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years.

341
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,215
Of course it was a line.

342
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:09,219
Why would anybody do something like that?

343
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:12,347
I assume we want an answer more sophisticated than:

344
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:15,416
''To get you into bed.''

345
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,258
I hate men.

346
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,357
Don't hate. You don't want to put that out into the universe.

347
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,264
Is it me?

348
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:30,467
Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with emotional problems can hear?

350
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:34,336
Come here. Give me your feet.

351
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,444
I just thought he was nice, you know?

352
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:50,552
I can't believe you didn't know it was a line.

353
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,333
Guess what?

354
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,300
You got a job?

355
00:23:56,368 --> 00:24:00,395
Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing.

356
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,821
I was laughed out of 1 2 interviews.

357
00:24:02,821 --> 00:24:04,436
You're surprisingly upbeat.

358
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:10,347
You'd be too, if you found these boots on sale 50% off.

360
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:13,407
How well you know me.

361
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,413
They're my ''I don't need a job I've got great boots'' boots.

363
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,288
How did you pay?

364
00:24:22,288 --> 00:24:23,317
Credit card.

365
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,363
And who pays for that?

366
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,366
My father.

367
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:35,465
Is this really necessary? I can stop charging any time.

368
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,334
You can't live off your parents.

369
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:42,278
I know that. That's why I was getting married.

370
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:46,244
Give her a break. It's hard being on your own.

371
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:47,340
Thank you.

372
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:50,548
I remember when I first came to this city, I was 1 4.

373
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:54,258
Mom had killed herself, stepdad was in jail.

374
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,293
I didn't know anybody here.

375
00:24:56,394 --> 00:25:01,195
I ended up living with this albino guy who was cleaning windshields.

376
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:03,199
And then he killed himself.

377
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:07,499
Then I found aromatherapy. So I know exactly how you feel.

378
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,436
The word you're looking for is:

379
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,213
''Anyway....''

380
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:22,817
You ready?

381
00:25:22,817 --> 00:25:24,415
No, how can I be ready?

382
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,458
''Ready to jump out of the plane with no parachute?''

383
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:29,238
I can't do this.

384
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:30,250
I know you can.

385
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:31,841
No.

386
00:25:31,841 --> 00:25:33,354
You made coffee, you can do anything.

387
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:39,226
Cut. Cut. Cut.

388
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:47,439
You know what? I think we can leave it at that.

389
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,542
Kind of a symbolic gesture.

390
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:51,538
Rachel, that was a library card.

391
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:03,325
If you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.

392
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,298
Welcome to the real world!

393
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,426
It sucks. You're gonna love it.

394
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,437
That's it. Are you going to crash on the couch?

395
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:25,210
No, I gotta go home sometime.

396
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,206
Are you gonna be okay?

397
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,314
Look what I just found on the floor.

398
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,418
What?

399
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:38,428
That's Paul's watch. Just put it back where you found it.

400
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,357
Oh, boy! All right.

401
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,399
Good night, everybody.

402
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:46,264
Good night.

403
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,782
I'm sorry. Have it, I don't want it.

404
00:26:58,782 --> 00:27:01,216
Split it?

405
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:11,387
You probably didn't know this, but in high school I had a major crush on you.

407
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,290
I knew.

408
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:17,391
You did?

409
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:21,331
I figured you thought I was Monica's geeky brother.

410
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,397
I did.

411
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,213
Listen, do you think...?

412
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:35,242
Try not to let my vulnerability become a factor here.

413
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:39,514
Do you think it would be okay if I asked you out sometime?

414
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:43,222
Yeah.

415
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,352
Maybe.

416
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:48,423
Okay.

417
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,261
Okay, maybe I will.

418
00:27:58,376 --> 00:27:59,889
Good night.

419
00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:01,402
Good night.

420
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,218
See you.

421
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:21,196
Wait, wait. What's with you?

422
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:27,428
I just grabbed a spoon.

423
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:38,239
-I can't believe what I'm hearing.
-Can't believe what I'm hearing

424
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:40,341
-What? I said--
-What? I said

425
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,818
Would you stop?

426
00:28:42,818 --> 00:28:44,217
Was I doing it again?

427
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:46,347
Yes!

428
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:51,327
I said you had a nice butt. It's just not a great butt.

429
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,392
You won't know a butt if it bit you.

430
00:28:53,392 --> 00:28:55,422
There's an image.

431
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:01,261
Would anybody like more coffee?

432
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,366
You made it, or you're serving it?

433
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,360
I'm just serving it.

434
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,311
I'll have a cup of coffee.

435
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:10,210
Kids, new dream.

436
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,305
I'm in Las Vegas.

437
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:14,283
Miss, more coffee?

438
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:18,321
Could you give this to that guy over there?

439
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,420
Go ahead. Thank you.

440
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:24,388
Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas.

441
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:27,187
I'm in Las Vegas.

442
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,292
I'm Liza Minnelli....
