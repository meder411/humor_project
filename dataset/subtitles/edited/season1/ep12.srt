1
00:00:57,431 --> 00:00:59,228
No, no, we're done!

2
00:01:47,415 --> 00:01:50,213
Aunt Silv, stop yelling!

3
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:55,447
If you'd told me vegetarian lasagna l would've made vegetarian lasagna.

5
00:01:57,324 --> 00:02:00,452
The meat's only every third layer. Maybe you could scrape.

6
00:02:01,462 --> 00:02:04,397
Ross, did you really read all these baby books?

7
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:12,332
You could plunk me down in any woman's uterus, no compass and l could find my way out like that!

9
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,364
This is cool.

10
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:19,272
It says in some parts of the world people eat the placenta.

11
00:02:21,215 --> 00:02:23,274
And we're done with the yogurt.

12
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,175
Sorry.

13
00:02:26,387 --> 00:02:30,187
l did this as a favor. l am not a caterer.

14
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:33,385
What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas?

15
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:36,388
Nice talk, Aunt Silv.

16
00:02:37,298 --> 00:02:39,425
You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?

17
00:02:40,434 --> 00:02:45,428
Ross, listen. Do you know that right now your baby is only this big?

18
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,198
This is your baby. ''Hi, Daddy.''

19
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:49,398
Hello.

20
00:02:50,244 --> 00:02:53,213
''How come you don't live with Mommy?''

21
00:02:54,415 --> 00:02:57,407
''How come Mommy lives with that other lady?''

22
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:04,280
''What's a lesbian?''

23
00:03:09,296 --> 00:03:11,355
Honey, you can say it. Poconos.

24
00:03:11,465 --> 00:03:16,266
Poconos. It's like ''poke a nose.''

25
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:21,264
Poke a nose.

26
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:30,799
So did l hear Poconos?

27
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,215
Yes.

28
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,379
My sister's giving us her place for the weekend.

29
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,384
First weekend together.

30
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:38,823
It's a big step.

31
00:03:38,823 --> 00:03:40,222
l know.

32
00:03:41,228 --> 00:03:43,276
It's just a weekend. Big deal.

33
00:03:43,276 --> 00:03:45,324
Wasn't this supposed to be a fling?

34
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:49,334
Shouldn't it be flung by now?

36
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:52,295
We are way past a ''fling.''

37
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:56,399
I'm feeling things I've read about in Danielle Steel books.

38
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,411
When I'm with him, I'm just totally....

39
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:02,342
Nauseous. I'm physically nauseous.

40
00:04:03,384 --> 00:04:07,184
What am l supposed to do? Call Immigration?

41
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:09,451
l could call Immigration.

42
00:04:15,162 --> 00:04:16,254
What?

43
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,199
Ugly Naked Guy is making shadow puppets.

44
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:23,466
Look, it's Abraham Lincoln.

45
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,398
Oh, right!

46
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,369
Go. Go!

47
00:04:35,182 --> 00:04:42,412
l love babies with their little baby shoes and their little baby toes and their little hands....

49
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,318
Okay, you're gonna have to stop that. Forever.

50
00:04:56,403 --> 00:04:58,200
Need a new table.

51
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,168
You think?

52
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:08,276
Come on in.

53
00:05:08,276 --> 00:05:09,271
Hello.

54
00:05:09,383 --> 00:05:15,185
l brought the books and Monica sends her love along with this lasagna.

56
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:19,249
Great! ls it vegetarian? Because Susan doesn't eat meat.

57
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:23,354
I'm pretty sure that it is.

58
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:32,171
Nineteen weeks, the breasts are starting to swell.

59
00:05:33,274 --> 00:05:35,299
According to the literature.

60
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:37,327
l got the results of the amnio.

61
00:05:37,327 --> 00:05:39,278
Tell me. ls everything...?

62
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,376
Totally and completely healthy.

63
00:05:41,376 --> 00:05:43,372
That is great!

64
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:51,384
When did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?

65
00:05:52,192 --> 00:05:54,183
That's our friend Tanya.

66
00:06:03,337 --> 00:06:06,135
Of course, it's your friend Tanya.

67
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,210
Don't you wanna know about the sex?

68
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:12,178
The sex?

69
00:06:13,347 --> 00:06:18,148
I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together.

70
00:06:18,185 --> 00:06:20,244
But when you throw in Tanya....

71
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,283
The sex of the baby, Ross.

72
00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:29,352
You know the sex of the baby?

73
00:06:31,198 --> 00:06:31,778
Want to know?

74
00:06:31,778 --> 00:06:32,358
No.

75
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,192
l don't want to. Absolutely not.

76
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:40,306
You shouldn't know until you look down there and see, ''Oh, there it is.''

78
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,368
Or isn't.

79
00:06:45,312 --> 00:06:46,358
Hello, Ross.

80
00:06:46,358 --> 00:06:47,404
Susan.

81
00:06:48,215 --> 00:06:49,182
So?

82
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,179
So did you hear?

83
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,276
Yes, we did. Everything's A-Okay.

84
00:06:53,387 --> 00:06:56,185
Oh, that's so cool!

85
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,383
It really is.

86
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:00,158
Do we know?

87
00:07:00,327 --> 00:07:03,262
We certainly do. It's going to be a--

88
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,319
Hello?

89
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:08,265
A guy who doesn't wanna know is standing here.

90
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,362
Well, is it what we thought it would be?

91
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:21,177
What--?

92
00:07:21,348 --> 00:07:23,282
What did we think it'd be?

93
00:07:24,251 --> 00:07:26,378
l don't wanna know. Don't wanna know.

94
00:07:27,187 --> 00:07:28,381
l should probably just go.

95
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:30,820
Well, thanks for the books.

96
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,384
No problem. Okay.

97
00:07:36,163 --> 00:07:37,187
Susan.

98
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:47,170
Who should we call first? Your folks or Deb and Rhona?

99
00:07:50,477 --> 00:07:52,206
Hello?

100
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:56,306
Never mind. I don't wanna know.

101
00:07:57,384 --> 00:08:01,150
Because it was my table, l have to buy a new one?

102
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:03,189
That's the rule.

103
00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:05,157
What rule? There's no rule.

104
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:06,789
You owe me a table.

105
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:08,353
How did you get there?

106
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:14,123
It was fine until your breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecio.

107
00:08:14,268 --> 00:08:16,133
You knew about that?

108
00:08:16,236 --> 00:08:20,263
The impressions in the butter left little to the imagination.

109
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:23,175
How about if we split it?

110
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:25,674
What do you mean, buy it together?

111
00:08:25,674 --> 00:08:27,170
Yeah.

112
00:08:27,347 --> 00:08:29,360
Do you think we're ready for that?

113
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,373
Why not?

114
00:08:32,152 --> 00:08:36,145
It's a big commitment. What if one of us wants to move out?

115
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,185
You're moving out?

116
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:38,180
I'm not.

117
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:39,338
You'd tell me if you were, right?

118
00:08:39,338 --> 00:08:40,384
Yes.

119
00:08:41,161 --> 00:08:43,226
It's just, with my last roommate--

120
00:08:43,226 --> 00:08:45,291
l know all about Kip.

121
00:08:45,365 --> 00:08:50,359
We bought a hibachi, then he ran off and got married. Things got ugly.

122
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:55,369
Let me ask you something. Was Kip a better roommate than me?

123
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:57,404
Oh, don't do that.

124
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,114
There's changes in your schedule.

125
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:09,213
Your 4:00 herbal massage is at 4:0.

126
00:09:09,256 --> 00:09:12,248
And Miss Summerfield canceled her 5:0 shiatsu.

127
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:13,348
Thanks.

128
00:09:14,228 --> 00:09:16,128
Oh, here comes your :00.

129
00:09:16,263 --> 00:09:20,165
l don't mean to sound unprofessional, but-- Yum!

130
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:27,230
Paolo! Hi! What are you doing here?

131
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:34,247
Rachella tell me you massage?

133
00:09:35,148 --> 00:09:37,173
Well, Rachella's right.

134
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:43,179
Oh, okay.

135
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,350
l don't know what you just said, so let's start.

136
00:09:48,262 --> 00:09:52,255
l am...being naked?

138
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,267
That's your decision. Some people prefer to take off--

139
00:09:58,305 --> 00:09:59,363
Being naked!

140
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:05,201
l can't believe you don't wanna know. l couldn't not know.

141
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,214
If the doctor knows, Carol and Susan know--

142
00:10:08,382 --> 00:10:10,179
And Monica knows.

143
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:13,183
How? l don't even know.

144
00:10:13,287 --> 00:10:16,381
Carol called to thank me for the lasagna. She told me.

145
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,418
So what's it gonna be?

146
00:10:22,195 --> 00:10:24,260
Oh, great! Now he knows.

147
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,325
I'm just excited about being an aunt.

148
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,233
Or an uncle.

149
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,369
Hey, Phoebe.

150
00:10:34,369 --> 00:10:35,398
Hey, Pheebs.

151
00:10:35,442 --> 00:10:36,431
Fine!

152
00:10:40,213 --> 00:10:41,811
What's the matter?

153
00:10:41,811 --> 00:10:43,409
Nothing. I'm just out of sorts.

154
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:47,419
Well, you can use some of my sorts. l rarely use them.

155
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:50,348
Can we get some cappuccino over here?

156
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:53,419
Oh, right! That's me!

157
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:58,321
That table place closes at 7. Come on.

158
00:10:58,432 --> 00:10:59,456
Fine.

159
00:11:01,368 --> 00:11:02,392
What is it?

160
00:11:04,204 --> 00:11:06,183
All right. You know Paolo?

161
00:11:06,183 --> 00:11:08,162
I'm familiar with his work.

162
00:11:09,276 --> 00:11:11,176
He made a move on me.

163
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:12,842
The store will be open tomorrow.

164
00:11:12,842 --> 00:11:14,406
More coffee, please.

165
00:11:16,383 --> 00:11:18,180
Well, what happened?

166
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:22,278
He came in for a massage, and everything was fine until....

167
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:27,360
Oh, my God.

168
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,327
Are you sure?

169
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,221
Oh, yeah. I'm sure.

170
00:11:36,203 --> 00:11:40,196
And all of a sudden, his hands weren't the problem anymore.

171
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:45,300
Was it...?

172
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:48,404
Boy Scouts could've camped under there.

173
00:11:52,352 --> 00:11:53,341
Wow.

174
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:55,387
What did you do?

175
00:11:55,387 --> 00:11:57,321
l dealt with it like a professional.

176
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:05,262
''Ooh,'' what?

177
00:12:05,365 --> 00:12:06,354
--ma Thurman.

178
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:07,814
The actress!

179
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:09,162
Uma Thurman!

180
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,259
Thanks, Rach.

181
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:15,320
What'll you do?

182
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,366
You have to tell her.

183
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:21,313
It's your moral obligation as a friend, as a woman. It's a feminist issue.

184
00:12:21,381 --> 00:12:22,370
Guys?

185
00:12:23,183 --> 00:12:24,730
You have to.

186
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,277
Feminist issue? That's where l went.

187
00:12:28,321 --> 00:12:29,805
She is gonna hate me!

188
00:12:29,805 --> 00:12:31,289
Yeah, well....

189
00:12:38,398 --> 00:12:41,196
Will you pick one? Just pick one.

190
00:12:41,234 --> 00:12:43,230
Here, how about that one?

191
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,226
That's patio furniture.

192
00:12:45,405 --> 00:12:50,240
So what? Like people will come in and think, ''Oh, I'm outside again.''

193
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,299
Fine.

194
00:12:52,212 --> 00:12:53,338
What about the birds?

195
00:12:54,514 --> 00:12:59,417
l don't know. They don't say, ''Hello, sit here. Eat something.''

196
00:13:00,387 --> 00:13:01,883
You pick one.

197
00:13:01,883 --> 00:13:03,379
Okay. How about the ladybugs?

198
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:08,252
Forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining.

199
00:13:08,361 --> 00:13:10,409
Fine! Want the birds? Get the birds!

200
00:13:10,409 --> 00:13:12,457
Not like that, l won't.

201
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:18,262
Kip would have liked the birds.

202
00:13:29,216 --> 00:13:30,211
Hi, Pheebs.

203
00:13:30,211 --> 00:13:31,206
What's going on?

204
00:13:31,284 --> 00:13:33,235
Are you moving out?

205
00:13:33,235 --> 00:13:35,186
I'm getting ready for the weekend.

206
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:39,290
Are your weekends longer than two days?

207
00:13:40,227 --> 00:13:42,195
These aren't all my suitcases.

208
00:13:42,295 --> 00:13:43,387
This one's Paolo's.

209
00:13:47,234 --> 00:13:49,213
Rachel, can we talk for a sec?

210
00:13:49,213 --> 00:13:51,192
Well, sure.

211
00:13:51,238 --> 00:13:53,399
Just for a sec, Paolo's on his way.

212
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:08,348
We haven't known each other that long.

213
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:11,289
There are three things you should know:

214
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:16,192
One, my friends are the most important thing in my life.

215
00:14:16,296 --> 00:14:18,264
Two, l never lie.

216
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,260
And three, l make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world.

217
00:14:25,372 --> 00:14:28,307
Okay. Thanks, Pheebs.

218
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,796
Oh, my God!

219
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:36,212
l know.

220
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:38,375
Why have l never tasted these?

221
00:14:38,418 --> 00:14:43,378
l don't make them a lot, because it's not fair to the other cookies.

222
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:52,421
These are the best oatmeal raisin cookies.

223
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:54,814
Which proves that l never lie.

224
00:14:54,814 --> 00:14:56,395
l guess you don't.

225
00:14:57,304 --> 00:14:59,397
Paolo made a pass at me.

226
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:03,234
What do you think?

227
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:06,245
It's the most beautiful table I've seen.

228
00:15:06,346 --> 00:15:07,335
l know.

229
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:10,343
Will you balance plates on these heads?

230
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:13,346
Who cares? We'll eat at the sink. Come on!

231
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:17,248
Heads up, Ross.

232
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:19,450
Score! You suck!

233
00:15:23,196 --> 00:15:24,254
Are you okay?

234
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,392
l need some milk.

235
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,361
Okay. I've got milk.

236
00:15:37,377 --> 00:15:39,174
Here you go.

237
00:15:47,387 --> 00:15:49,184
Better?

238
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,414
No.

239
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:59,391
l feel so stupid! l think about the other day with you guys.

240
00:15:59,432 --> 00:16:03,232
And l was all, ''Oh, Paolo! He's so great!

241
00:16:03,336 --> 00:16:05,236
He makes me feel so--''

242
00:16:06,172 --> 00:16:07,230
God!

243
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:09,267
I'm so embarrassed!

244
00:16:09,376 --> 00:16:11,241
I'm so embarrassed.

245
00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:13,244
I'm the one he hit on.

246
00:16:13,244 --> 00:16:15,144
l unleashed him on you.

247
00:16:15,181 --> 00:16:17,149
If l had never met him--

248
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,245
I'm so sorry.

249
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:19,240
No, I'm sorry.

250
00:16:19,352 --> 00:16:20,364
I'm sorry.

251
00:16:20,364 --> 00:16:21,376
I'm sorry. Wait.

252
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:23,268
What are we sorry about?

253
00:16:23,268 --> 00:16:24,348
l don't know.

254
00:16:24,457 --> 00:16:26,391
Right. He's the pig.

255
00:16:27,193 --> 00:16:28,290
Such a pig!

256
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,387
Oh, God, he's such a pig!

257
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:33,291
He's like a big disgusting pig....

258
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,782
Pig man!

259
00:16:34,782 --> 00:16:36,164
Yes, good!

260
00:16:40,273 --> 00:16:43,265
But he was my pig man!

261
00:16:44,377 --> 00:16:46,368
How did l not see this?

262
00:16:48,281 --> 00:16:49,305
Oh, l know!

263
00:16:52,385 --> 00:16:56,184
Because he's gorgeous.

265
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:57,415
And he's charming.

266
00:16:58,224 --> 00:16:59,287
And when he looks--

267
00:16:59,287 --> 00:17:00,350
Okay, Pheebs.

268
00:17:01,127 --> 00:17:02,253
The end.

269
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:06,120
God.

270
00:17:08,134 --> 00:17:10,125
Should l not have told you?

271
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:14,170
Trust me, it's much better that l know.

272
00:17:17,277 --> 00:17:21,236
But l just liked it better before. It was better.

273
00:17:38,198 --> 00:17:42,157
She took it pretty well. Paolo's over there now, so....

274
00:17:42,302 --> 00:17:46,363
We should go and see if she's okay. Just one second.

275
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,254
Score!

276
00:17:49,254 --> 00:17:50,300
Game! Nice!

277
00:17:52,412 --> 00:17:54,175
Come on, Pheebs.

278
00:17:55,382 --> 00:17:58,374
Well, it looks like we kicked your butts.

279
00:17:58,418 --> 00:18:03,117
She did. You could be on the Olympic ''Standing There'' team.

280
00:18:03,156 --> 00:18:04,248
Come on. Two on one.

281
00:18:04,357 --> 00:18:07,224
Why are you here? She just broke up with him.

282
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:09,420
It's time for you to swoop in.

283
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:11,780
What, now?

284
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,230
Yes. Now is when you swoop.

285
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:17,225
When Paolo walks out, you gotta be the first guy she sees.

286
00:18:17,337 --> 00:18:22,240
She's gotta know you're everything he's not. You're the anti-Paolo.

287
00:18:24,177 --> 00:18:26,145
My Catholic friend is right.

288
00:18:26,246 --> 00:18:28,373
She's distraught. You're there for her.

289
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:34,382
You pick up the pieces and then you usher in ''The Age of Ross.''

290
00:18:41,361 --> 00:18:42,811
See this? See?

291
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:44,261
Hold it! Ascolta!

292
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:48,362
How's it going?

293
00:18:48,362 --> 00:18:49,357
Don't stare.

294
00:18:49,402 --> 00:18:54,362
She threw his clothes off the balcony. Now there's gesturing and arm-waving.

295
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:58,303
That is, ''How could you?'' or ''Enormous breasts!''

296
00:19:00,313 --> 00:19:02,213
Here he comes.

297
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:16,158
l am to say goodbye.

299
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:18,160
Okay, bye-bye.

300
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:30,142
Paolo, l really hate you for what you did, but l still have five of these so heat it at 75 until the cheese bubbles.

302
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,374
l just wanna tell you, and l think I'd speak for everyone when l say....

303
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:48,193
Oh, just look at her.

304
00:19:48,294 --> 00:19:52,243
Guys, l think only one of us should go so she's not overwhelmed.

306
00:19:52,243 --> 00:19:53,289
Right.

307
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:56,199
And l really think it should be me.

308
00:20:13,186 --> 00:20:14,278
You all right?

309
00:20:15,288 --> 00:20:17,222
I've been better.

310
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:20,292
l don't believe this.

311
00:20:21,227 --> 00:20:24,219
l wasn't supposed to care about this guy.

312
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:29,200
It was just supposed to be this big, fun, ltalian thing.

313
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:34,395
Someday l could look back and say, ''That was a big, fun, ltalian thing.''

314
00:20:36,242 --> 00:20:39,439
It wasn't supposed to feel like this when it was over.

315
00:20:42,315 --> 00:20:43,339
Come here.

316
00:20:50,423 --> 00:20:55,317
Listen you deserve so much better than him.

318
00:20:55,428 --> 00:21:02,167
l mean, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.

320
00:21:05,405 --> 00:21:06,394
What?

321
00:21:07,407 --> 00:21:10,308
I'm so sick of guys!

322
00:21:11,277 --> 00:21:15,407
l don't want to look at or think about another guy.

323
00:21:16,216 --> 00:21:19,208
l don't even want to be near another guy.

324
00:21:26,226 --> 00:21:28,421
Ross, you're so great.

325
00:21:40,306 --> 00:21:41,352
Are you all right?

326
00:21:41,352 --> 00:21:42,398
Are you okay?

327
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:44,807
Medium. Any cookies left?

328
00:21:44,807 --> 00:21:46,405
Yeah.

329
00:21:49,449 --> 00:21:55,413
See, Rach l don't think swearing off guys altogether is the answer.

331
00:21:56,222 --> 00:22:00,249
What you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.

332
00:22:02,262 --> 00:22:04,457
l just need to be by myself for a while.

333
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,779
l just gotta figure out what l want.

334
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:08,360
No, no.

335
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:13,305
See, because not all guys out there are gonna be a Paolo.

336
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,364
No, l know. l know.

337
00:22:15,408 --> 00:22:20,175
And I'm sure your little boy's not gonna grow up to be one.

338
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,175
What?

339
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:23,170
What?

340
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,182
I'm having a boy?

341
00:22:28,187 --> 00:22:29,313
No.

342
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:33,384
No. In fact, you're not having a boy.

343
00:22:34,294 --> 00:22:36,194
I'm having a boy.

344
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:39,348
Huh? Am l having a boy?

345
00:22:39,348 --> 00:22:41,299
You're having a boy!

346
00:22:41,434 --> 00:22:43,197
I'm having a boy!

347
00:22:43,303 --> 00:22:44,298
I'm having a boy!

348
00:22:44,298 --> 00:22:45,293
What is it?

349
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:48,238
I'm having a boy! I'm having a boy!

350
00:22:52,211 --> 00:22:53,405
We already knew that!

351
00:22:57,216 --> 00:22:58,410
I'm having a son.

352
00:23:06,392 --> 00:23:09,293
Yes! And that would be a shutdown!

353
00:23:09,362 --> 00:23:10,386
Shutout!

354
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:17,168
Where you going? One more game!

355
00:23:17,203 --> 00:23:18,733
It's 2:0 in the morning.

356
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:20,263
Yeah, get out!

357
00:23:20,473 --> 00:23:23,408
You guys always hang out in my apartment.

358
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,303
l'll only use my left hand.

359
00:23:26,412 --> 00:23:28,380
Come on, wussies!

360
00:23:32,385 --> 00:23:34,410
All right! Okay! l gotta go!

361
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,312
I'm going.

362
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,282
And I'm gone.

363
00:23:41,227 --> 00:23:42,211
One more game?

364
00:23:42,211 --> 00:23:43,195
Oh, yeah.
