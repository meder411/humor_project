1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,359
Okay, I checked.

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:06,405
We have Earl Grey, English Breakfast,

3
00:00:06,405 --> 00:00:10,392
Cinnamon Stick Chamomile, Mint Medley,

5
00:00:10,392 --> 00:00:12,343
Blackberry and--

6
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:13,895
Wait, there's one more.

7
00:00:13,895 --> 00:00:15,345
Lemon Soother!

8
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:18,830
You're not the guy that asked

9
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,377
for tea, are you?

10
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:13,805
Mail call!

11
00:01:13,805 --> 00:01:15,238
Rachel Greene, bunk seven.

12
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:16,467
Thank you.

13
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,791
Oh, cool!

14
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:21,338
A free sample of coffee.

15
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,360
Oh, good. Because where else

16
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,339
would we get any?

17
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:28,252
Oh, right.

18
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:30,855
Oh, great.

19
00:01:30,855 --> 00:01:32,254
What is it?

20
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,260
Country club newsletter.

21
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,811
My mother sends me the engagement

22
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:39,262
notices for inspiration.

23
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,463
Oh, my God! It's Barry and Mindy!

24
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,498
Barry, who you almost--

25
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,466
And Mindy, your maid of--

26
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,374
Let me see. That's Mindy?

27
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:51,501
She is pretty!

28
00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:00,343
Lucky...to have had a friend like you.

30
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,448
Now it's quiet time.

31
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:12,331
Marcel, bring me the rice. Come on.

32
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,332
Good boy. Give me the rice.

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,265
Thank you. Good boy.

34
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,916
He's mastered the difference between

35
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:21,430
''bring me the'' and ''pee in the.''

36
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:25,794
''Bring me the'' and--

37
00:02:25,794 --> 00:02:27,244
Rach?

38
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,475
Oh, I'm sorry.

39
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,384
This is so stupid!

40
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,477
I mean, I gave Barry up, right?

41
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,280
I should be happy for them.

42
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,258
I am. I'm happy for them.

43
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,859
Really?

44
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:43,258
No.

45
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,414
I guess it would be different

46
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:47,365
if I were with somebody.

47
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,492
Whoa, what....

48
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,333
What happened to ''Forget

49
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,363
relationships! I'm done with men!''

50
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,376
The whole penis embargo?

51
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,436
I don't know.

52
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:05,279
It's not about no guys.

53
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:07,309
It's about the right guy.

54
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,416
With Barry it was safe and easy,

55
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,412
but there was no heat.

56
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,319
With Paolo, all there was, was heat.

57
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,895
It was this raw, animal, sexual--

58
00:03:17,895 --> 00:03:20,329
Right. I got it.

59
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,326
I was there.

60
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,327
Do you think you can have both?

61
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,889
Someone who's your best friend

62
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:30,340
but also can make your toes curl.

63
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,434
Yes.

64
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,343
Yes, I do. I really do.

65
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,546
In fact, it's funny.

66
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,780
Often, someone

67
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:49,257
you wouldn't think could curl your toes might just be the one who...gets interrupted.

71
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,488
How was the movie?

72
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:51,861
Wonderful!

73
00:03:51,861 --> 00:03:52,458
So good!

74
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,381
Suck fest.

75
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:55,496
Total chick flick.

76
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,336
I'm sorry it wasn't one of those

77
00:04:00,336 --> 00:04:05,206
movies with guns and bombs and buses going really fast!

79
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,763
I don't need violence

80
00:04:08,763 --> 00:04:11,379
in a movie as long as

82
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:12,442
there's a little nudity.

83
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,866
There was nudity.

84
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:16,413
I meant female nudity.

85
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,387
I don't need to see

86
00:04:18,387 --> 00:04:20,252
Lou Grant frolicking.

87
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,328
Hugh! Hugh Grant!

88
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,332
All right, I've got to go.

89
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,229
Come on, Marcel.

90
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,285
We're gonna go take a bath.

91
00:04:30,285 --> 00:04:32,236
Yes, we are, aren't we?

92
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,364
They're still just friends, right?

93
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,537
And I will see you tomorrow.

94
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,777
You're gonna spend

95
00:04:42,777 --> 00:04:44,273
tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's.

96
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,285
Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?

97
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,351
Please, Aunt Monica, please?

98
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,937
Unclench. You're not even

99
00:04:51,937 --> 00:04:53,484
gonna be here.

100
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:02,300
I can't believe we're discussing this.

101
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,235
I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief.

102
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,338
If it was gonna happen,

103
00:05:07,338 --> 00:05:09,238
wouldn't it have happened already?

104
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,809
She said she wants a relationship

105
00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:14,209
with someone exactly like me.

106
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,338
She said that?

107
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:19,214
I added the ''exactly like me'' part.

108
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,434
But she's looking for someone.

109
00:05:21,434 --> 00:05:23,516
And someone will be there tonight.

110
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,349
''Tonight'' tonight?

111
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,908
It's perfect.

112
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:28,358
It'll just be the two of us.

113
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,379
She spent all day

114
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:32,330
taking care of my monkey.

115
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,330
I can't remember the last time

116
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,326
a girl took care of my monkey.

117
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,338
Anyway, I figured after work,

118
00:05:44,338 --> 00:05:50,348
I'd pick up some wine go over there and try to woo her.

120
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,349
Know what you should do?

121
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,466
Take her back to the 1890s

122
00:05:55,466 --> 00:05:57,479
when that phrase was last used.

123
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,390
If you keep this up, you'll be

124
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:05,386
finished by the weekend.

125
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,762
The one in the feathered boa

126
00:06:07,762 --> 00:06:09,292
is Dr. Francis.

127
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:11,428
Now, she used to be a man.

128
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,429
Look, there's Raven.

129
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,334
We hate her. We're glad she's dying.

130
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:18,842
And then--

131
00:06:18,842 --> 00:06:20,241
What? Marcel!

132
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,381
Are you playing with Monica's shoes?

133
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,349
You're not supposed to--

134
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:30,320
Marcel, did you poo in the shoe?

135
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:33,257
Oh, Marcel! Bad monkey!

136
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,327
Oh, God!

137
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,367
Sorry, Barry.

138
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,227
A little engagement gift.

139
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:46,834
I'm sure you didn't

140
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:48,330
register for that.

141
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,279
Who died? Who died?

142
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,767
Roll him over!

143
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:01,183
Come on, roll him over!

144
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,251
Well, we know it wasn't Dexter,

145
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:06,281
right, Marcel? Because--

146
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:07,324
Marcel?

147
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,796
How could you lose him?

148
00:07:12,796 --> 00:07:14,195
I don't know!

149
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,814
We were watching TV,

150
00:07:15,814 --> 00:07:17,395
he pooped in Monica's shoe....

151
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,921
Wait. He pooped in my shoe?

152
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:20,405
Which one?

153
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,437
I don't know. The left one!

154
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,199
Which ones?

155
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,359
Those little clunky Amish things

156
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:29,407
you think go with everything.

157
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,345
Why is the air in here so negative?

158
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,256
Rachel lost Marcel.

159
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,347
Oh, no! How?

160
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:41,421
He pooped in my shoe.

161
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:42,416
Which one?

162
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,254
The cute black ones I always wear.

163
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,355
No, which one?

164
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:50,266
The right or left?

165
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,427
Because the left one is lucky.

166
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:53,836
Come on!

167
00:07:53,836 --> 00:07:54,433
What am I gonna do?

168
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,805
All right. You're a monkey.

169
00:07:56,805 --> 00:07:58,369
You're loose in the city.

170
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,378
Where do you go?

171
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,795
It's his first time out,

172
00:08:02,795 --> 00:08:04,410
so he'll do touristy things.

173
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,802
I'll go to Cats.

174
00:08:09,802 --> 00:08:11,417
You go to the Russian Tea Room.

175
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,741
Oh, my God!

176
00:08:13,741 --> 00:08:15,191
Come on, you guys!

177
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,340
He'll be home any minute.

178
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,386
He's gonna kill me!

179
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,210
Search the building. Take the first

180
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,223
floor. We'll take the rest.

181
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,393
What am I gonna do?

182
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:25,266
You stay here

183
00:08:25,266 --> 00:08:26,329
and wait by the phone.

184
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:28,322
Spray Lysol in my shoe

185
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:30,239
and wait for Ross to kill you.

186
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,436
Does anybody want to trade?

187
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,413
What do you want?

188
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:45,254
Mr. Heckles, have you seen a monkey?

189
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:46,871
I left a Belgian waffle out here.

190
00:08:46,871 --> 00:08:48,418
Did you take it?

191
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,324
Why'd you leave it in the hall?

192
00:08:51,324 --> 00:08:53,320
I wasn't ready for it.

193
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,434
Have you seen a monkey?

194
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,430
I saw Regis Philbin once.

195
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,372
Thank you, Mr. Heckles.

196
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,309
You owe me a waffle.

197
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,826
He's a black capuchin monkey

198
00:09:07,826 --> 00:09:12,679
with a white face with Russian dressing

200
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,176
and pickles on the side.

201
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:16,277
Thanks.

202
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,316
How did it go today?

203
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:20,909
Oh, great!

204
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:22,393
It went great. Really great.

205
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,224
Is that wine?

206
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:26,323
You want some?

207
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,299
Oh, I would love some.

208
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,199
But let's not drink it here.

209
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,868
I'm feeling crazy.

210
00:09:32,868 --> 00:09:34,432
You wanna go to Newark?

211
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:41,345
Okay, but before we head off to

212
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:45,913
the murder capital of the Northeast I kind of wanted

214
00:09:45,913 --> 00:09:47,409
to run something by you.

215
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,283
You know how we

216
00:09:49,283 --> 00:09:53,357
were talking before about relationships, and stuff.

218
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,859
Oh, God, Ross, I cannot do this!

219
00:09:55,859 --> 00:09:58,259
Okay, quick and painful.

220
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,463
Oh, God!

221
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,808
Okay, all right.

222
00:10:09,808 --> 00:10:11,275
All right, okay.

223
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,368
Please don't hate me.

224
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,435
What?

225
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,350
You know Marcel?

226
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,349
I kind of lost him.

227
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:44,272
I can't believe this.

228
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,873
All I asked you to do was

229
00:10:45,873 --> 00:10:47,369
keep him in here!

230
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,469
I know. I'm sorry.

231
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,515
It's partially my fault.

232
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,380
I shouldn't have had you

233
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,477
start with a monkey.

234
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,782
You should have started

235
00:10:55,782 --> 00:10:57,278
with a pencil.

236
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,807
I'm doing everything I can.

237
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:02,224
Everyone's looking for him and I got--

238
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,297
Who is it?

239
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:06,264
-Animal Control.

240
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,845
I've even got Animal Control.

241
00:11:08,845 --> 00:11:11,325
You called Animal Control?

242
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,240
Why? Do you not like them?

243
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:22,437
Marcel is an illegal exotic animal.

244
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,048
I'm not allowed to have him. If they

245
00:11:28,048 --> 00:11:30,545
find him, they'll take him away.

246
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,837
Well, now, see,

247
00:11:32,837 --> 00:11:34,384
you never ever told us that.

248
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,357
Because I never expected you

249
00:11:37,357 --> 00:11:39,353
to invite them to the apartment!

250
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,267
Thanks for coming.

251
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,363
Somebody called about a monkey?

252
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,391
You know, that was

253
00:11:50,391 --> 00:11:52,308
a complete misunderstanding.

254
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,828
We thought we had a monkey,

255
00:11:53,828 --> 00:11:55,278
but we didn't.

256
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:56,298
Turned out it was a hat.

257
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,282
Cat!

258
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,218
We checked, no one's seen Marcel.

259
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,302
My uncle Marcel.

260
00:12:04,302 --> 00:12:06,350
Is that who the monkey's named after?

261
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:08,855
Possession of an illegal exotic

262
00:12:08,855 --> 00:12:12,346
is punishable by two years in prison

264
00:12:12,346 --> 00:12:14,263
and confiscation of the animal.

265
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,322
Oh, my God!

266
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:17,798
You'd put that poor

267
00:12:17,798 --> 00:12:19,328
little creature in jail?

268
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,757
Remember how we talked about saying

269
00:12:26,757 --> 00:12:29,271
things quietly to yourself first?

270
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:33,249
Yes, but there isn't always time.

271
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:37,805
I'm sure there's some friendly way

272
00:12:37,805 --> 00:12:40,256
to reconcile this. Have a seat.

273
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,452
We haven't met. I'm Monica Geller.

274
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,456
Oh, my God, you are!

275
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,391
And you're Rachel Greene!

276
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,495
Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High?

277
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:55,398
I sat behind you guys in homeroom.

278
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:59,368
Luisa! Oh, my God!

279
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,412
Monica! It's Luisa!

280
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,408
I went there too!

281
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:07,515
Luisa! From homeroom!

282
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,452
You have no idea who I am, do you?

283
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:13,788
No.

284
00:13:13,788 --> 00:13:14,351
Not at all.

285
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,944
Well, maybe that's because

286
00:13:16,944 --> 00:13:19,361
you spent four years ignoring me.

287
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:21,399
Would it have been hard to say,

288
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:26,233
''Morning, Luisa'' or ''Nice overalls''?

290
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,273
Oh, I'm so sorry!

291
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:34,392
It's not so much you. You were fat.

292
00:13:34,392 --> 00:13:36,440
You had your own problems.

293
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,475
But you. What a bitch!

294
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,251
What?

295
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:48,522
You know what? Be that as it may could you help us with the

297
00:13:48,522 --> 00:13:50,552
monkey thing, for old times' sake?

298
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,265
Go, Bobcats!

299
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,457
I could. But I won't.

300
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:00,233
If I find that monkey, he's mine.

301
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,245
Sorry.

302
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,338
Marcel?

303
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:13,307
Marcel?

304
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,428
Hi, can I help you?

305
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,849
We're having an emergency,

306
00:14:29,849 --> 00:14:32,232
and we were looking for something.

307
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,369
A monkey.

308
00:14:34,369 --> 00:14:35,466
Yes, have you seen any?

309
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,369
No, I haven't seen a monkey.

310
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,435
Can you fix radiators?

311
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,413
Sure! Did you try turning the knob

312
00:14:42,413 --> 00:14:44,347
back the other way?

313
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,900
Of course!

314
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,350
Oh. Then, no.

315
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,453
Taste this. Is there too much rum?

316
00:14:53,453 --> 00:14:55,449
Just a second.

317
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:56,927
Hope you find your monkey.

318
00:14:56,927 --> 00:14:58,360
No, wait!

319
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:04,831
We may not know about radiators but we do have expertise

321
00:15:04,831 --> 00:15:07,328
in the heating and cooling milieu.

322
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,303
Aren't we in the middle of something?

323
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,363
But these women are very hot,

324
00:15:15,363 --> 00:15:17,314
and they need our help.

325
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,309
And they're very hot!

326
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,252
We can't, all right?

327
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,448
We're sorry.

328
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,874
You don't know how sorry.

329
00:15:27,874 --> 00:15:29,523
We promised to find this monkey.

330
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,792
He's this high

331
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:33,322
and answers to the name Marcel.

332
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,413
So if we could get pictures of you,

333
00:15:35,413 --> 00:15:37,461
it'd help us out.

334
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,428
From now on, you don't get

335
00:15:47,428 --> 00:15:49,379
to talk to other people.

336
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:58,751
Oh, my God!

337
00:15:58,751 --> 00:15:59,245
What?

338
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,825
Something brushed up

339
00:16:00,825 --> 00:16:02,292
against my right leg.

340
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:04,791
Oh, it's okay.

341
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,287
It was just my left leg.

342
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,427
Look, Phoebe!

343
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,392
Oh, Marcel! Come here!

344
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:13,330
Step aside, ladies.

345
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,736
What are you gonna do?

346
00:16:16,736 --> 00:16:18,232
Just a tranquilizer.

347
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,227
Run, Marcel, run!

348
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,317
Damn!

349
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:38,942
Are you okay?

350
00:16:38,942 --> 00:16:40,455
I think so.

351
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,330
Oh, gosh!

352
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,399
We've been all over the neighborhood!

353
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:05,378
He's just gone!

354
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,307
You don't know that.

355
00:17:07,307 --> 00:17:09,190
It's cold, it's dark.

356
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,287
He doesn't know the Village!

357
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,865
And now I have a broken foot.

358
00:17:13,865 --> 00:17:16,333
I have no monkey and a broken foot!

359
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,198
Thank you very much!

360
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,205
I've said I'm sorry a million times.

361
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,206
What do you want me to do?

362
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,276
You want me to break my foot too?

363
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:27,244
I'll break it right now.

364
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:28,876
Oh, my God!

365
00:17:28,876 --> 00:17:30,440
There, are you happy now?

366
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:38,348
Yeah, now that you kicked the sign I don't miss Marcel anymore!

368
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,908
It's not like

369
00:17:40,908 --> 00:17:42,358
I did this on purpose.

370
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,453
No, this is just vintage Rachel.

371
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,460
Things just sort of happen around you!

372
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,831
You're off in ''Rachel Land,''

373
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:54,267
doing your ''Rachel Thing'' oblivious to people's monkeys

375
00:17:54,267 --> 00:17:56,297
or to people's feelings and--

376
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,905
I don't want to hear it!

377
00:17:57,905 --> 00:17:59,435
Forget it, okay?

378
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,370
What?

379
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,411
Hey, banana man!

380
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,222
This is so intense!

381
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,791
One side of my butt is totally asleep

382
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:20,288
and the other side has no idea.

383
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,851
What's with Phoebe?

384
00:18:24,851 --> 00:18:26,500
Tranquilizer dart.

385
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,399
Hi! Did you order some bananas?

386
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,256
What about it?

387
00:18:32,256 --> 00:18:33,302
Give me my monkey back!

388
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:35,312
I don't have a monkey.

389
00:18:35,312 --> 00:18:37,212
Then what's with the bananas?

390
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,240
Potassium.

391
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,450
Okay, where is he?

392
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,451
You're wasting your time.

393
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,421
What?

394
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,369
What have you done to him?

395
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:05,365
That's my monkey. That's Patty.

396
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,280
Are you insane? Come here, Marcel.

397
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,374
Come here, Patty.

398
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,282
Come here, Marcel.

399
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:15,408
Come here, Patty.

400
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,416
Here, monkey.

401
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,279
Here, monkey!

402
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:21,291
Gotcha!

403
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:23,291
Give me my monkey back!

404
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,388
It's mine.

405
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,420
Take this up with the judge.

406
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,264
That's not my monkey. The dress

407
00:19:29,264 --> 00:19:31,329
is mine. Send it back whenever.

408
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,404
All right, I want my monkey!

409
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,972
Oh, come on, Luisa.

410
00:19:34,972 --> 00:19:36,439
Sorry, prom queen.

411
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:38,772
You had to be a bitch in school,

412
00:19:38,772 --> 00:19:40,302
instead of fat.

413
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:50,518
In high school, I was prom queen and the homecoming queen and you were also there.

416
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,435
But this isn't high school.

417
00:19:53,435 --> 00:19:55,414
We're all adults here!

418
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,458
Heckles! Can I have this?

419
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,262
For the most part.

420
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,398
If you take this monkey, I'll lose

421
00:20:03,398 --> 00:20:05,463
an important person in my life.

422
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,267
You can hate me if you want,

423
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:10,263
but please do not punish him.

424
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,905
You have a chance

425
00:20:11,905 --> 00:20:13,435
to be the bigger person here.

426
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,446
Take it!

427
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:19,472
No.

428
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,819
All right. Then I'll call

429
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:28,258
your supervisor and tell her you shot my friend with a dart!

431
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:36,817
It'll be nice to get this off,

432
00:20:36,817 --> 00:20:38,267
won't it?

433
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,362
Or we can leave it on. That's fine.

434
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,454
With the right pumps,

435
00:20:43,454 --> 00:20:45,502
that would be a great little outfit.

436
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,429
Listen, I'm sorry I was so hard

437
00:20:51,429 --> 00:20:53,477
on you before--

438
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,433
No, it was my fault.

439
00:20:55,433 --> 00:20:57,281
I almost lost your--

440
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,953
Yeah, but you got him back.

441
00:20:58,953 --> 00:21:00,517
You were great.

442
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,527
We still have that bottle of wine.

443
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,247
Are you in the mood

444
00:21:11,247 --> 00:21:13,226
for something grape?

445
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,851
Sure, that would be good.

446
00:21:14,851 --> 00:21:16,364
All right.

447
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,443
The neighbors must be vacuuming.

448
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:43,268
Well, as long as we're here...and not on the subject....

450
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:50,770
I was thinking about...how mad we got

452
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,266
at each other before.

453
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,397
And maybe it was partially

454
00:21:57,397 --> 00:21:59,280
because of how we--

455
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:00,433
Rachel?

456
00:22:00,433 --> 00:22:01,348
Barry?

457
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,920
I can't do it.

458
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,320
I can't marry Mindy.

459
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,223
I think I'm still in love with you.

460
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,245
We have got to start

461
00:22:16,245 --> 00:22:18,224
locking that door!

462
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:27,336
Show us! Come on!

463
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,414
It was such a long time ago.

464
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,382
Okay, fine. All right.

465
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,463
This is me in The Sound of Music.

466
00:22:33,463 --> 00:22:35,476
See the von Trapp kids?

467
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,256
That's because I'm in front of them.

468
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,258
Big nun!

469
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,257
I thought that was an alp.

470
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:45,325
High school wasn't

471
00:22:45,325 --> 00:22:46,354
my favorite time.

472
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,490
I loved high school.

473
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:50,865
It was four years of parties,

474
00:22:50,865 --> 00:22:52,463
dating and sex and--

475
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:54,818
Well, I went to boarding school

476
00:22:54,818 --> 00:22:56,365
with 400 boys.

477
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:58,841
Any sex I had would've involved

478
00:22:58,841 --> 00:23:01,207
a major lifestyle choice.

479
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,330
Doesn't it seem like

480
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:06,213
a million years ago?

481
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:13,257
My butt cheek is waking up!
