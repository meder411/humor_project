1
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:05,431
I can't believe you'd actually say that.

2
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:09,333
I'd much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.

3
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:12,343
No way. Mr. Salty is a sailor.

4
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:15,348
He's gotta be the toughest snack there is.

5
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:20,351
I don't know. You don't wanna mess with Cornnuts.

6
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,352
They're crazy.

7
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:27,258
Oh, my God. You gotta come see this.

8
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:30,387
There's some creep out there with a telescope.

9
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,460
I can't believe it. He's looking right at us.

10
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:36,462
Oh, that is so sick.

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,464
I feel violated.

12
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,466
And not in a good way.

13
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,374
How can people do that?

14
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:48,576
You guys, look. Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots.

15
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:45,461
Years from now, school children will study it as one of the greatest first dates ever.

17
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,390
Yeah.

18
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,374
I'll say, yeah.

19
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,299
It was unbelievable.

20
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,402
We could be ourselves. We didn't have to play games.

21
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,476
Have you called her?

22
00:01:55,476 --> 00:01:57,472
She'd know I like her. That's crazy.

23
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,308
Guys. It's gross.

24
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:02,252
It's the next day. How needy do I wanna seem?

25
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,818
I'm right. Right?

26
00:02:03,818 --> 00:02:05,314
Yeah, let her dangle.

27
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,526
I can't believe my parents are pushing me to find one of you people.

28
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,358
Come on. Just do it.

29
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:18,234
Call her. Stop being so testosterone-y.

30
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,432
Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.

31
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,475
Her machine.

32
00:02:28,475 --> 00:02:29,470
Answering machine?

33
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:33,446
No, interestingly, her leaf blower picked up.

34
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,281
So, why didn't you say anything?

35
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:45,363
No. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase, ''Yes, indeed-io.''

37
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:49,459
Look, it's Rachel and Barry. Don't everybody look.

38
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,496
What's going on?

39
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,768
They're just talking.

40
00:02:53,768 --> 00:02:55,264
Does he look upset?

41
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,469
Does he look like he was told to shove anything?

42
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,314
No. Actually, he's smiling.

43
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,406
Oh, my God. Don't do that.

44
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:05,513
What? What? What?

45
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,449
That man across the street just kicked that pigeon.

46
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:16,525
And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.

47
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:21,262
See? Hey, Rach.

48
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,359
How'd it go?

49
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,433
You know, it was actually really great.

50
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,435
Lunch at the Russian Tea Room.

51
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,474
I had that chicken, where you poke it and butter squirts out.

52
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,475
Not a good day for birds.

53
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,443
Then we went to Bendel's.

54
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:41,448
And I told him not to, but he got me a bottle of Chanel.

55
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:51,261
That's nice. Now was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending flowers and to leave you alone?

57
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:55,300
Right. Well, we never actually got to that.

58
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,370
It was just so nice to see him again.

59
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:02,237
It was comfortable and it was familiar.

60
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,205
It was just nice.

61
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,210
That's nice twice.

62
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:11,340
Isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?

63
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,311
Where have you been?

64
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,312
It was different with him today.

65
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,258
He wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy.

66
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,229
I mean, we had fun. Is there anything wrong with that?

67
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:28,800
Why?

68
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,267
I have my reasons.

69
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:38,344
He's engaged to another woman who happens to be your ex-best friend?

71
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,242
All right. I know it's stupid.

72
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:44,373
I'll see him this afternoon and put an end to it.

73
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:55,291
I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that.

74
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,395
No, it wasn't.

75
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,429
It was so nice having this little sink here.

76
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:14,236
Then with authority, hang up.

77
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,442
Will you just leave her the message?

78
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,219
Okay. All right, fine.

79
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,315
''Oh, Danielle, I wasn't expecting the machine.

80
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,455
Give me a call when you get a chance.

81
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,457
Bye-bye.''

82
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,459
Oh, God.

83
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:42,332
That's what you've been working on for two hours?

84
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,470
Hey, I've been honing.

85
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,845
What was with the dishes?

86
00:05:47,845 --> 00:05:50,245
She might think I'm in a restaurant.

87
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:56,479
I might have a life. Like I haven't been sitting here honing for the last two hours?

89
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,286
The telescope guy's doing it again.

90
00:05:59,286 --> 00:06:01,282
Oh, my God.

91
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:06,426
Go away. Stop looking in here.

92
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,326
Great. Now he's waving back.

93
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,398
We gotta do something.

94
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:17,499
I caught him looking into our place. I feel like I can't do stuff.

95
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,412
What kind of stuff?

96
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:29,311
Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff but, like, when I'm cooking naked.

98
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,219
You cook naked?

99
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:35,419
Yeah, toast, oatmeal. Nothing that spatters.

100
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,360
What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.

101
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,363
What's the matter?

102
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,433
I just-- Oh, Barry, this was not good.

103
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,540
No, it was. It was very, very good.

104
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:53,941
What about Mindy?

105
00:06:53,941 --> 00:06:55,437
Way better than Mindy.

106
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,378
I mean, what about you and Mindy?

107
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,289
If you want, I'll break it off with her.

108
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,285
No, don't do that. Not for me.

109
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:12,228
Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment.

110
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,232
Thanks, Bernice.

111
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,334
Let's go away this weekend.

112
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,883
This is all way too--

113
00:07:18,883 --> 00:07:20,430
No, we can go to Aruba.

114
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:29,247
When I went there on what would've been our honeymoon it was really nice. You would've liked it.

116
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:31,442
I had a bra.

117
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,418
Hey, Dr. Farber.

118
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,366
All right, Miss Greene, everything looks fine.

119
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,430
We're starting to see some real progress.

120
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:56,870
What?

121
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,366
I'm 1 2, I'm not stupid.

122
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,319
Can I use your phone?

123
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:16,218
For future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.

125
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,333
Yes, it's working.

126
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,287
Why isn't she calling?

127
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:27,238
Maybe she never got your message.

128
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:33,235
Call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps that means she didn't get her messages yet.

130
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,278
Doesn't that make me seem--?

131
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:38,343
Desperate? Needy? Pathetic?

132
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:41,318
You obviously saw my personal ad.

133
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,255
How many beeps?

134
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:46,450
She answered.

135
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:52,227
This is where you'd use that ''hello'' word.

136
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:59,461
I won't talk to her. She got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed.

138
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,365
God, I miss just being needy.

139
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,471
So how'd he take it?

140
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,373
Pretty well, actually.

141
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,377
How come you have dental floss in your hair?

142
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,281
Oh, do I?

143
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,326
We ended up having sex in his chair.

144
00:09:23,326 --> 00:09:25,425
You had sex in his chair?

145
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,305
I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?

146
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,238
You had what?

147
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,334
Sex in his chair.

148
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:45,206
What...? What were you thinking?

149
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,311
I don't know. We still care about each other.

150
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,346
There's a history there. It's like you and Carol.

151
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,318
It's nothing like me and Carol.

152
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:04,361
If she said to you, ''Ross, I want you on this couch right here, right now,'' what would you say?

154
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,430
If it helps, I could slide over.

155
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:14,440
It's a totally different situation. It's apples and oranges.

156
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,444
It's orthodontists and lesbians-- I gotta go.

157
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,331
Where are you going?

158
00:10:20,331 --> 00:10:21,377
I just have to go.

159
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:25,253
I have things to do with my life.

160
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,384
I have a jam-packed schedule.

161
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,362
And I am late for keeping up with it, okay?

162
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,403
Mindy.

163
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,474
How are you?

164
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:54,309
Yes, I heard. Congratulations. That is so great.

165
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,388
Really, oh, God--

166
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:04,228
I'm working tomorrow, but if you want, you can come by if you'd like.

167
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,262
Great.

168
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,459
Great.

169
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,269
So I'll see you tomorrow.

170
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,534
Okay. Bye.

171
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,437
Oh, God. Oh, God.

172
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,541
So how's Mindy?

173
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:30,253
She wants to see me tomorrow. She sounded weird. I gotta call Barry.

174
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,260
It's me. I just-- Mindy.

175
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:41,264
Mindy. No, I figured that's where you'd be.

176
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,444
Hell is filled with people like you.

177
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,418
He's back. The peeper's back.

178
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:07,475
Get down.

179
00:12:07,475 --> 00:12:08,425
Get down?

180
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:10,319
And boogie.

181
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:15,459
I gotta go and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy.

182
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,429
She may not even know.

183
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:23,368
I haven't heard from her in seven months, what else is it about?

184
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,433
She was my best friend.

185
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,442
We went to camp together, she taught me how to kiss....

186
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,443
Now, you know, I'm, like, the other woman.

187
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:36,972
I feel so--

188
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:38,456
Naughty.

189
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,909
See you later.

190
00:12:41,909 --> 00:12:43,359
I'll walk with you.

191
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:49,265
When she taught you to kiss, were you wearing any kind of little uniform--?

192
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,464
That's fine, yeah.

193
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,299
I'm going to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?

194
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:58,843
Take it with you.

195
00:12:58,843 --> 00:13:02,280
We haven't had a second date she needs to hear me pee?

197
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,214
Why don't you call her?

198
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:07,308
I can't. I left a message. I have some pride.

199
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,414
Do you?

200
00:13:08,414 --> 00:13:09,409
No.

201
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,354
Danielle, hi.

202
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,420
It's Chandler.

203
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,329
I'm fine.

204
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:23,462
Listen....

205
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:30,470
I don't know if you tried to call me because I accidentally shut off my phone.

207
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,539
That's fine. That's great. Okay.

208
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:41,251
She's on the other line. She's gonna call me back.

209
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:45,289
She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back.

210
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,370
Don't you have to pee?

211
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,349
That's why I'm dancing.

212
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:54,311
Mindy.

213
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:55,357
Hey, you.

214
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,468
Hey, you.

215
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,398
So what's up?

216
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,235
We should really be sitting for this.

217
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,311
Sure we should.

218
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:22,419
I'm gonna ask once, and I want a straight answer.

219
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:27,421
Not like when I asked if those red pants made my ass look big.

220
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:39,344
I know things have been weird but you're my oldest friend, except for Laurie who's bitter because she lost weight and it turns out, she doesn't have a pretty face.

224
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,874
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

225
00:14:40,874 --> 00:14:42,370
Okay.

226
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,351
Will you be my maid of honor?

227
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,373
Of course.

228
00:14:51,373 --> 00:14:52,357
That's so great.

229
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,350
It is. It is. It is.

230
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,445
That's all you wanted to ask?

231
00:14:57,445 --> 00:14:59,396
That's all.

232
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,718
What?

233
00:15:03,718 --> 00:15:05,202
That's not all.

234
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,901
Oh, sure it is.

235
00:15:07,901 --> 00:15:09,397
Oh, no, it isn't.

236
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,438
I think Barry's seeing someone in the city.

237
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,305
What would make you think that?

238
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,351
Since the engagement, he's acted weird.

239
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:25,412
And then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel.

240
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,416
Really?

241
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:35,425
If it'll make you feel any better when Barry and I got engaged, he was weird too.

243
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,328
Oh, God. That's what I was afraid of.

244
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,237
What's what you were afraid of?

245
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:51,338
When Barry was engaged to you, he and I kind of had a little thing on the side.

247
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:53,346
What?

248
00:15:53,346 --> 00:15:54,341
I know, I know.

249
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:59,447
When he proposed, people said, ''He'll do to you what he did to Rachel.''

250
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:02,220
And now I feel so stupid.

251
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,195
You are so stupid.

252
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,336
We are both so stupid.

253
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,338
What do you mean?

254
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,205
Smell familiar?

255
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,405
Oh, I'm so sorry.

256
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,408
Oh, no, me. I am so sorry.

257
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:27,515
No, I am sorry. I'm sorry.

258
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:43,360
Oh, my.

259
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,335
Four letters, ''circle or hoop.''

260
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,890
Ring, damn it, ring.

261
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,340
Thanks.

262
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:56,442
You know our phone's not working?

263
00:16:56,442 --> 00:16:58,438
What?

264
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,476
I called and there was no answer.

265
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,381
I turned it off.

266
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,180
Mother of God, I turned it off.

267
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,326
Just like you told her you did.

268
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,390
Just pointing out the irony.

269
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:16,197
I went across the street to the doorman.

270
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:20,227
I got the peeper's name. Can I use the phone?

271
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,207
Can I use your phone?

272
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:29,313
The number for a Sidney Marks, please.

273
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,440
''Heating device.''

274
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,409
Radiator.

275
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,208
Five letters.

276
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,219
''Rdtor.''

277
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,360
Yeah, is Sidney there?

278
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,365
Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman.

279
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,298
So she's a woman, so what?

280
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,463
Yeah, so what?

281
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:56,264
I live across the street, and I know about your telescope.

282
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,307
And I don't appreciate it.

283
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,242
Yeah, I can see you right now. Hello?

284
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:06,373
If I wanna walk around in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel--

285
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,316
Thank you.

286
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:14,223
That's not really the point. The point is, that--

287
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:17,319
Mostly free-weights, but occasionally--

288
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:22,198
Yeah, my neighbor. Yeah, the brunette.

289
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:27,236
She said you looked pretty that day in the green dress.

290
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,500
The green dress? Really?

291
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:33,302
She said you looked like Ingrid Bergman.

292
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,442
Did she mention me?

293
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:46,357
She wants to know why you tie the towel around your head.

294
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:50,252
It's a leave-in conditioner, okay?

295
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,425
It's a leave-in conditioner.

296
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,237
You got a second?

297
00:18:59,237 --> 00:19:00,204
Sure, sure.

298
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:03,271
Come on in.

300
00:19:03,271 --> 00:19:04,368
Hello, sweetheart.

301
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,278
What you guys doing here?

302
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,213
We are here to break up with you.

303
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,374
Both of you?

304
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:18,281
We think you're a horrible person, and bad things should happen to you.

305
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,415
I'm sorry. God, I am so sorry.

306
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,320
I was weak. I couldn't help myself.

307
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:28,490
Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much.

308
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:33,396
Which one of us are you talking to there?

309
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:36,396
Mindy.

310
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,336
Of course, Mindy. It was always Mindy.

311
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:42,242
When we were having sex in that chair?

312
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:46,214
I swear, whatever I was doing, I was thinking of you.

313
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:51,415
Please. That second time, you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup.

314
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,418
You did it twice?

315
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:58,225
The first time didn't really count. You know, it was Barry.

316
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:02,365
Honey, sweetheart, look. Just give me another chance.

317
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:05,368
We'll start over. We'll go back to Aruba.

318
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:10,430
What is it with you and Aruba? Do you have a deal with the airlines?

319
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:12,467
What do you say?

320
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,473
Dr. Farber, we've got an emergency here.

321
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,442
Jason Castalano's choking on his retainer.

322
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,446
Oh, God. I'll be right there, Bernice.

323
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,245
Look, please don't go anywhere.

324
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,290
I'll be right back.

325
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,484
Okay, and we'll be here, hating you.

326
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:34,455
See how he was sweating when he walked out?

327
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:41,270
If I'm hogging the ball, you jump right in there and take some punches. This feels great.

329
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,570
I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.

330
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,369
What are you talking about?

331
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,381
Mindy, the guy is the devil.

332
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,474
He is Satan in a smock.

333
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,387
I know he's not perfect.

334
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:11,325
But the truth is at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber D.D.S.

337
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,226
Oh, God.

338
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:17,265
I hope you can find a way to be happy for me.

339
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:20,470
And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor.

340
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,341
And I hope Barry doesn't kill you and eat you in Aruba.

341
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,550
You okay?

342
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,552
Really?

343
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:45,461
Since I ran out on Barry at the wedding I've wondered whether I made the right choice.

345
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:47,363
And now I know.

346
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,304
I'm so glad.

347
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:55,573
Big day.

348
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,417
I'll give you this: Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.

349
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,461
He's got the monocle, he's got the top hat....

350
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:12,423
Did you know he's gay?

351
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:20,227
I just wanna clarify this. Are you outing Mr. Peanut?

352
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,272
Danielle, hi.

353
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,369
Everybody, this is Danielle. Danielle, everybody.

354
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,371
Why are you here?

355
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,474
I've been calling, but I had your number wrong.

356
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,345
When I got the right one, there was no answer.

357
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:41,256
So I thought I'd come down here and make sure you were okay.

358
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,282
I'm okay.

359
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:45,295
Maybe we could get together later?

360
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:50,265
That sounds good. I'll call you. Or you call me, whatever.

361
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,360
You got it.

362
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,437
Bye, everybody.

363
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:53,404
Bye.

364
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:57,792
There you go.

365
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,276
Second date.

366
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,402
I don't know.

367
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,302
You don't know?

368
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:06,248
She seems nice, but her coming all the way here...

369
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:11,221
...just to see if I was okay? I mean, how needy is that?
