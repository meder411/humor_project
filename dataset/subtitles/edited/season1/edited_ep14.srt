1
00:00:02,451 --> 00:00:04,442
Ross, she wants you.

2
00:00:05,253 --> 00:00:07,414
We just live in the same building.

3
00:00:08,256 --> 00:00:09,302
Any contact?

4
00:00:09,302 --> 00:00:10,348
She lent me an egg.

5
00:00:10,425 --> 00:00:12,393
You're in!

6
00:00:12,393 --> 00:00:14,361
Right.

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,422
Hey, Ross.

8
00:00:22,437 --> 00:00:25,338
Come on. Get back in the game.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,343
The Rachel thing isn't happening, your ex-wife's a lesbian....

10
00:00:30,445 --> 00:00:32,436
I don't think we need a third.

11
00:00:33,248 --> 00:00:36,240
Could we get an egg, still in the shell?

12
00:00:36,351 --> 00:00:37,340
An egg?

13
00:00:37,386 --> 00:00:42,346
Go up to her and say, ''I'm returning your egg.''

14
00:00:43,258 --> 00:00:45,351
I think it's winning.

15
00:00:45,394 --> 00:00:46,924
It's insane.

16
00:00:46,924 --> 00:00:48,454
She'll love it.

17
00:00:49,297 --> 00:00:51,293
Thank you.

18
00:00:51,293 --> 00:00:53,289
Thank you. Here.

19
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,262
Go with the egg, my friend.

20
00:00:59,374 --> 00:01:01,399
Go, go, go!

21
00:01:03,412 --> 00:01:04,925
Think it'll work?

22
00:01:04,925 --> 00:01:06,438
No way. It's suicide.

23
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:58,294
You can't do this.

24
00:01:58,294 --> 00:01:59,289
Do what?

25
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:01,852
Roger wants to take her out.

26
00:02:01,852 --> 00:02:04,303
No! Remember why you dumped him?

27
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,237
Because he was creepy.

28
00:02:07,342 --> 00:02:09,310
And mean. And frightening.

29
00:02:09,344 --> 00:02:14,213
Still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!

30
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:17,249
You can go out with a creep any night.

31
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,414
I know I do.

32
00:02:22,424 --> 00:02:24,938
What are you doing tomorrow night?

33
00:02:24,938 --> 00:02:27,452
That depends on how tonight goes.

34
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,743
About tonight--

35
00:02:29,743 --> 00:02:31,256
Don't you bail on me!

36
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:35,235
I said I'd bring a friend for her friend.

37
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,300
But her friend sounds like a--

38
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,330
Pathetic mess. I know, but....

39
00:02:40,242 --> 00:02:42,437
Come on. She's needy, vulnerable.

40
00:02:42,477 --> 00:02:45,446
I'm thinking....

41
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:51,285
Thanks.

42
00:02:51,353 --> 00:02:55,449
You haven't been out with a woman since Janice. You're doing this.

43
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,373
She said yes.

44
00:03:00,373 --> 00:03:02,386
Way to go, man!

45
00:03:03,231 --> 00:03:05,324
Still got the egg, huh?

46
00:03:18,413 --> 00:03:20,404
How do I look?

47
00:03:21,249 --> 00:03:23,410
I don't care.

48
00:03:26,421 --> 00:03:28,412
There's Lorraine.

49
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:32,256
No trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.

50
00:03:32,427 --> 00:03:34,418
Hi, Joey.

51
00:03:37,265 --> 00:03:40,325
Well, well! Look what you brought!

52
00:03:40,468 --> 00:03:43,232
Very nice.

53
00:03:43,338 --> 00:03:46,364
And what did you bring?

54
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,441
She's checking her coat.

55
00:03:49,244 --> 00:03:52,338
I'm gonna wash the cab smell off of my hands.

56
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,476
Get me a white zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice.

57
00:04:01,223 --> 00:04:03,282
Janice?

58
00:04:04,226 --> 00:04:06,285
Janice!?

59
00:04:06,428 --> 00:04:11,331
Oh my God!

62
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:17,433
Hey, it's Janice!

63
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:25,438
Okay, I'm making a break for it!

64
00:04:26,214 --> 00:04:30,412
I've been waiting for, like, forever to go out with Lorraine.

65
00:04:31,219 --> 00:04:32,231
Just calm down.

66
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,243
Calm down?

67
00:04:33,321 --> 00:04:37,451
You set me up with a woman I've dumped twice in the last five months!

68
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,521
Can you stop yelling? You're making me nervous and....

69
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:48,234
I can't go when I'm nervous.

70
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:50,463
I'm sorry, you're right.

71
00:04:54,342 --> 00:04:57,334
Come on! Do it, do it!

72
00:04:59,347 --> 00:05:03,181
Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete.

73
00:05:03,285 --> 00:05:04,252
Who?

74
00:05:04,252 --> 00:05:05,219
Pete the Weeper.

75
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,279
The guy that used to cry every time we had sex?

76
00:05:09,324 --> 00:05:13,226
''Was it good for you?''

77
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:18,290
I'd take crying any day over Howard, the ''I win'' guy!

78
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,392
''I win! I win!''

79
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:26,196
We went out for two months. I didn't win once.

80
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:29,404
How do we end up with these jerks?

81
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:32,413
We're some kind of magnets.

82
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:36,440
I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.

83
00:05:39,354 --> 00:05:42,221
There's more beer, right?

84
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:47,260
You know my friend who shaves her head?

85
00:05:47,429 --> 00:05:48,418
No.

86
00:05:48,463 --> 00:05:52,229
I have this friend who shaves her head.

87
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:58,363
She says to break the bad boyfriend cycle you can do a cleansing ritual.

89
00:06:00,275 --> 00:06:04,371
Pheebs, this woman is voluntarily bald.

90
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,406
Yeah.

91
00:06:07,282 --> 00:06:09,409
We can do it tomorrow night.

92
00:06:10,218 --> 00:06:12,277
It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.

93
00:06:12,387 --> 00:06:14,412
Okay, what kind of ritual?

94
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,320
We can burn the stuff they gave us.

95
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:21,287
Or...?

96
00:06:21,396 --> 00:06:27,392
Or we can chant and dance around naked with sticks.

97
00:06:29,437 --> 00:06:32,406
Burning's good.

98
00:06:41,316 --> 00:06:47,348
You know I can pick up quarters with my toes.

100
00:06:47,455 --> 00:06:51,357
Yeah? Good for you.

101
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:56,354
Quarters or rolls of quarters?

102
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:05,405
By the way, I cut you out of all of my pictures.

103
00:07:06,174 --> 00:07:10,474
So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads.

104
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:12,406
That's okay.

105
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:16,478
You could make little puppets out of them.

106
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:21,382
And you could use them in your Theater of Cruelty!

107
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:25,775
We can't do that!

108
00:07:25,775 --> 00:07:28,226
What? What can't you do?

109
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:35,200
Can I talk to you for a second? Over there?

110
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:43,437
We might be leaving now.

111
00:07:44,212 --> 00:07:47,204
Tell me it's you and me ''we.''

112
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:51,241
She wants to slather my body with stuff and lick it off.

113
00:07:51,352 --> 00:07:54,344
I'm not even sure what slathering is!

114
00:07:54,422 --> 00:07:58,256
But I definitely want to be a part of it!

115
00:07:58,426 --> 00:08:02,260
Okay, you cannot do this to me.

116
00:08:02,397 --> 00:08:05,161
You're right. I'm sorry.

117
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:09,464
Can we have three chocolate mousses to go?

118
00:08:10,271 --> 00:08:12,398
I'm out of here.

119
00:08:13,374 --> 00:08:17,208
Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me.

120
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:20,213
I hope she throws up on you.

121
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:24,174
Thanks.

122
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,804
So....

123
00:08:26,804 --> 00:08:28,288
Just us.

124
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:31,187
What a crappy night!

125
00:08:31,292 --> 00:08:38,291
I have enjoyed the fact that your shirt's been sticking out of your zipper.

127
00:08:43,404 --> 00:08:46,237
Excuse me.

128
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:51,301
How you doing?

129
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:58,350
So do we have the best friends, or what?

130
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:07,253
Joey's not a friend. He's a stupid man who left us his credit card.

132
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:11,264
Another drink? Dessert? A big-screen TV?

133
00:09:11,366 --> 00:09:12,862
I'll have a drink.

134
00:09:12,862 --> 00:09:14,358
Got it. Good woman!

135
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,922
A bottle of overpriced champagne.

136
00:09:21,922 --> 00:09:23,469
Each.

137
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:27,477
That's right, each. And a rob roy.

138
00:09:28,216 --> 00:09:30,184
I've always wanted to know.

139
00:09:48,202 --> 00:09:53,333
Happy Valentine's Day!

140
00:09:59,414 --> 00:10:03,407
Oh, I miss you already.

141
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:04,947
Can you believe this happened?

142
00:10:04,947 --> 00:10:06,443
No, no!

143
00:10:08,423 --> 00:10:10,516
And yet it did.

144
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:12,755
Goodbye, Janice.

145
00:10:12,755 --> 00:10:14,251
Kiss me!

146
00:10:16,264 --> 00:10:18,323
Oh, Chandler. Sorry.

147
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:21,527
Oh, Chandler. Sorry!

148
00:10:23,271 --> 00:10:24,300
Hey, Janice.

149
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,329
Hi, Monica.

150
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,433
Well, this was very special.

151
00:10:29,477 --> 00:10:32,537
Rach, come see who's out here!

152
00:10:33,281 --> 00:10:36,250
What's going on? Oh, my God!

153
00:10:36,351 --> 00:10:38,444
Janice! Hi!

154
00:10:38,553 --> 00:10:42,489
Janice is gonna go away now!

155
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:46,393
I'll be right back.

156
00:10:46,494 --> 00:10:49,486
Joey! Look who it is!

157
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:54,393
Good. Joey's home.

158
00:10:54,469 --> 00:10:57,302
This is so much fun!

159
00:10:57,372 --> 00:11:01,240
This is like a reunion in the hall!

160
00:11:02,343 --> 00:11:06,336
Ross, there's someone I want you to say hi to.

161
00:11:07,515 --> 00:11:09,312
He happened to call.

162
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:14,310
Hi, Ross. That's right, it's me! How did you know?

163
00:11:29,437 --> 00:11:46,443
So, if dogs experience jet lag because of the seven dog years to one human year thing when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses a week and a half.

167
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,282
That's funny!

168
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,233
They should be cooking the food soon.

169
00:12:02,336 --> 00:12:03,496
Oh, good.

170
00:12:14,215 --> 00:12:15,307
Who are they?

171
00:12:15,349 --> 00:12:24,348
The blond is my ex-wife. The woman touching her is her close, personal friend.

173
00:12:26,227 --> 00:12:28,724
They're lovers?

174
00:12:28,724 --> 00:12:31,221
If you want to put a label on it.

175
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:35,318
Anything else I should know?

176
00:12:35,318 --> 00:12:37,269
Nope. That's it.

177
00:12:37,472 --> 00:12:41,431
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby.

178
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:48,271
I always forget that part.

179
00:12:48,349 --> 00:12:50,476
Hello!

180
00:12:56,257 --> 00:13:02,196
Now we need sage branches and the sacramental wine.

181
00:13:03,197 --> 00:13:06,223
All I had is oregano and a Fresca.

182
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,393
That's okay!

183
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:17,300
Now we need the semen of a righteous man.

184
00:13:22,216 --> 00:13:27,347
If we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.

185
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:29,838
Can we start throwing things in?

186
00:13:29,838 --> 00:13:32,255
Yeah, okay!

187
00:13:35,229 --> 00:13:37,424
Okay. Barry's letters.

188
00:13:37,532 --> 00:13:40,365
Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.

189
00:13:40,434 --> 00:13:46,236
And I have the receipt from my dinner with....

190
00:13:48,476 --> 00:13:50,410
A picture of Scotty Jared naked!

191
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:52,344
Let me see!

192
00:13:52,446 --> 00:13:54,346
He's wearing a sweater.

193
00:13:54,346 --> 00:13:56,246
No.

194
00:14:00,421 --> 00:14:01,905
Whose MCI card is that?

195
00:14:01,905 --> 00:14:03,389
Mine. Shoot!

196
00:14:04,192 --> 00:14:08,390
Remember this number: Nine, seven, four....

197
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:13,429
Okay, and here we have the last of Paolo's grappa.

198
00:14:14,202 --> 00:14:16,397
Wait, isn't it almost pure--

199
00:14:20,508 --> 00:14:24,410
How can I dump this woman on Valentine's Day?

200
00:14:24,512 --> 00:14:28,346
I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.

201
00:14:29,217 --> 00:14:33,313
In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.

202
00:14:34,455 --> 00:14:38,255
Hello, funny valentine!

203
00:14:38,326 --> 00:14:40,453
Hi, just Janice.

204
00:14:41,262 --> 00:14:44,231
Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker.

205
00:14:44,265 --> 00:14:47,359
I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna.

206
00:14:52,373 --> 00:14:56,332
If you don't do it, I will.

207
00:15:15,196 --> 00:15:17,761
So are you actually from New York?

208
00:15:17,761 --> 00:15:20,326
Not originally. I'm from--

209
00:15:20,434 --> 00:15:22,430
You said they'd shoot it without you.

210
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,426
I thought they could.

211
00:15:25,206 --> 00:15:31,202
The maxi-pads were a piece of cake. Mini-pads should be that much easier.

212
00:15:31,245 --> 00:15:33,241
It's Valentine's Day.

213
00:15:33,241 --> 00:15:35,237
I know, but it's my job.

214
00:15:35,316 --> 00:15:38,342
I'll try to get back as soon as I can.

215
00:15:38,452 --> 00:15:46,455
I'm spending most of my time teaching science which is funny because that wasn't even my major.

217
00:15:58,239 --> 00:16:01,174
Now, that is funny!

218
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:08,307
Do you think it would be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?

219
00:16:08,382 --> 00:16:14,287
Because she's alone now. And pregnant. And sad.

220
00:16:14,322 --> 00:16:16,301
I guess.

221
00:16:16,301 --> 00:16:18,280
Are you sure? Carol!

222
00:16:18,392 --> 00:16:19,859
Wanna join us?

223
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:21,326
No, I'm fine.

224
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:24,489
Come on. These people will scooch down.

225
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:31,331
You guys will scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on!

226
00:16:31,405 --> 00:16:32,918
Come on.

227
00:16:32,918 --> 00:16:34,431
Thank you.

228
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:40,237
Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristen.

229
00:16:40,348 --> 00:16:42,299
How do you do?

230
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:44,250
Carol teaches sixth grade.

231
00:16:44,418 --> 00:16:47,251
And Kristen....

232
00:16:50,324 --> 00:17:01,197
Kristen does something that, funnily enough wasn't even her major!

235
00:17:03,204 --> 00:17:05,286
Thanks for coming over.

236
00:17:05,286 --> 00:17:07,368
Not at all. It's pretty much our job.

237
00:17:07,408 --> 00:17:10,377
That's why we get the cool hats.

238
00:17:10,411 --> 00:17:12,828
What do we got there?

239
00:17:12,828 --> 00:17:15,245
A piece of silk boxer shorts.

240
00:17:15,316 --> 00:17:17,409
Some greeting cards.

241
00:17:18,386 --> 00:17:21,253
A half-charred picture of....

242
00:17:21,322 --> 00:17:24,382
That guy's hairier than the chief!

243
00:17:27,395 --> 00:17:31,297
It's a really funny story how this happened.

244
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:37,201
I was taking out the trash, and Phoebe was burning incense--

245
00:17:37,238 --> 00:17:38,330
It's all right.

246
00:17:38,406 --> 00:17:43,434
This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire we've seen get out of control.

247
00:17:44,345 --> 00:17:45,391
Third one tonight.

248
00:17:45,391 --> 00:17:46,437
Really?

249
00:17:47,214 --> 00:17:51,241
Valentine's is our busiest night of the year.

250
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:56,415
Next time you're burning your ex-boyfriend's stuff:

251
00:17:56,457 --> 00:17:59,426
One, do it in a well-ventilated area.

252
00:17:59,527 --> 00:18:05,159
Two, if you wanna burn his clothing, stay away from synthetic fabrics.

253
00:18:05,199 --> 00:18:10,398
Three, try to let go of the anger, and learn to love yourself.

254
00:18:13,174 --> 00:18:14,789
I brought you something.

255
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:16,404
Is it loaded?

256
00:18:20,281 --> 00:18:26,277
Oh, little candy hearts. ''Chan and Jan Forever.''

257
00:18:27,188 --> 00:18:29,383
I had them made special.

258
00:18:32,426 --> 00:18:35,395
Okay, Janice.

259
00:18:37,431 --> 00:18:40,332
Hey, Janice.

260
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,396
There's no way to tell you this.

261
00:18:44,438 --> 00:18:47,305
At least, there's no new way.

262
00:18:50,311 --> 00:18:54,338
I just don't think things are gonna work out.

263
00:18:55,516 --> 00:18:59,350
That's fine.

264
00:19:01,155 --> 00:19:02,383
It is?

265
00:19:03,157 --> 00:19:07,457
Because I know that this isn't the end.

266
00:19:08,362 --> 00:19:11,160
You see, actually, it is.

267
00:19:11,198 --> 00:19:14,167
No, because you won't let that happen.

268
00:19:14,268 --> 00:19:16,168
Don't you know it yet?

269
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:20,366
You love me, Chandler Bing!

270
00:19:23,277 --> 00:19:25,302
Oh, no, I don't.

271
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:30,373
Why do we keep ending up together? New Year's, who invited who?

272
00:19:30,484 --> 00:19:32,452
Valentine's, who asked who into bed?

273
00:19:32,452 --> 00:19:34,420
I did, but--

274
00:19:35,222 --> 00:19:36,382
You seek me out!

275
00:19:36,423 --> 00:19:41,417
Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn!

276
00:19:42,229 --> 00:19:45,426
Janice! Janice!

277
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:50,226
You push me away, you pull me back!

278
00:19:50,404 --> 00:19:53,237
You want me. You need me.

279
00:19:53,307 --> 00:19:58,301
You can't live without me. And you know it.

280
00:19:58,412 --> 00:20:04,248
You just don't know you know it.

281
00:20:07,254 --> 00:20:09,313
See?

282
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:17,424
Call me!

283
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:28,531
It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.

284
00:20:29,276 --> 00:20:32,370
You did so, I swear to--

285
00:20:35,382 --> 00:20:38,442
How long has she been in the bathroom?

286
00:20:38,552 --> 00:20:42,283
She isn't in the bathroom. Her coat's gone.

287
00:20:42,356 --> 00:20:46,258
Well, maybe it's cold in there.

288
00:20:46,493 --> 00:20:50,259
I screwed up my first date in nine years.

289
00:20:50,297 --> 00:20:51,895
That could be it.

290
00:20:51,895 --> 00:20:53,493
Oh, God.

291
00:20:54,268 --> 00:20:57,567
You know, this is still pretty hot.

292
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,301
Mushroom.

293
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,401
Smile.

294
00:21:05,512 --> 00:21:10,313
They won't all be like this. Some might stay through dinner.

295
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:11,930
I'm sorry. That's not funny.

296
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,443
It's just....

297
00:21:14,221 --> 00:21:17,418
You know the whole ''get on with your life'' thing?

298
00:21:17,458 --> 00:21:20,256
Well, do I have to?

299
00:21:20,327 --> 00:21:32,462
I'm sitting here with this cute woman and she's perfectly nice, but that...that's it.

302
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:38,234
Then I'm here talking to you, and it's easy and it's fun.

303
00:21:38,345 --> 00:21:40,438
And I don't have to....

304
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,311
I know.

305
00:21:42,311 --> 00:21:43,374
You know?

306
00:21:46,487 --> 00:21:49,479
Here's a wacky thought.

307
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:53,488
Let's say you and I give it another shot.

308
00:21:54,261 --> 00:21:57,389
I know what you're gonna say. You're a lesbian.

309
00:21:58,465 --> 00:22:03,300
But what do you say we just put that aside for now.

310
00:22:03,404 --> 00:22:06,305
Let's just stick a pin in it.

311
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:12,301
Because we're great together. You can't deny it.

312
00:22:12,446 --> 00:22:16,405
I've got a ring at home that fits you.

313
00:22:16,517 --> 00:22:21,420
I've got lots of pictures with both of us in them.

314
00:22:22,222 --> 00:22:26,249
And best of all, you're carrying my baby.

315
00:22:26,327 --> 00:22:27,777
I mean, how perfect is that?

316
00:22:27,777 --> 00:22:29,227
Ross--

317
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:34,461
You keep saying that, but there's something right here. I love you.

318
00:22:41,442 --> 00:22:44,434
I love you too.

319
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,325
But--

320
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:47,371
No ''but.''

321
00:22:48,449 --> 00:22:53,443
You know that thing we put over here with the pin in it?

322
00:22:55,255 --> 00:22:59,351
It's time to take the pin out.

323
00:23:04,198 --> 00:23:07,429
You'll find someone. The right woman is waiting for you.

324
00:23:08,235 --> 00:23:12,399
It's easy for you to say. You found one already.

325
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:17,333
All you need is a woman who likes men, and you'll be set.

326
00:23:20,414 --> 00:23:23,349
Not her.

327
00:23:34,361 --> 00:23:38,354
So, you guys really slide down a pole?

328
00:23:41,235 --> 00:23:43,231
Absolutely.

329
00:23:43,231 --> 00:23:45,227
That's so cool.

330
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:48,272
How do you get back up?

331
00:23:50,277 --> 00:23:54,475
Well, we rarely have to return from a fire as quickly.

332
00:23:57,484 --> 00:24:00,282
So, would you guys....

333
00:24:00,387 --> 00:24:05,324
Would you like to, sometime, maybe....

334
00:24:05,392 --> 00:24:07,383
Go for a drink sometime?

335
00:24:07,428 --> 00:24:09,225
Sure, sounds good.

336
00:24:09,296 --> 00:24:12,390
We get off at midnight. We'll pick you up then.

337
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,394
Okay. Great!

338
00:24:15,402 --> 00:24:19,304
So will you bring the truck?

339
00:24:20,407 --> 00:24:23,308
I'll even let you ring the bell.

340
00:24:23,343 --> 00:24:25,322
We'll see you later.

341
00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:27,301
Bye! See you later!

342
00:24:28,348 --> 00:24:29,406
Oh, my God!

343
00:24:31,218 --> 00:24:33,413
See? There you go. The cleansing worked.

344
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,512
You're right. They're nice guys!

345
00:24:37,257 --> 00:24:41,216
They're firemen guys!

346
00:24:41,261 --> 00:24:43,309
Tell them you're married?

347
00:24:43,309 --> 00:24:45,357
No. My girlfriend doesn't even know.
