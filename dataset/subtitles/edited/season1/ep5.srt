1
00:00:02,235 --> 00:00:04,328
Let it go. It's not a big deal.

2
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:09,374
Not a big deal? It's amazing. You reach in, there's one maneuver and bam!

3
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,535
A bra. Right out the sleeve.

4
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:17,282
As far as I know, guys don't do anything that comes close. Right?

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,342
Come on! You guys can pee standing up.

6
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:23,286
We can? Okay, I'm trying that.

7
00:00:24,457 --> 00:00:26,288
Know what blows my mind?

8
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:29,453
Women can see breasts anytime they want.

9
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:34,262
You look down, and there they are.

10
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,302
How you get any work done is beyond me.

11
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:44,368
I don't get how guys can do so many mean things and not even care.

13
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:51,846
Multiple orgasms!

14
00:00:51,846 --> 00:00:53,376
There you go.

15
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,274
Saturday night. The big night!

16
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:52,267
Date night! Saturday night. Saturday night!

17
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:54,442
No plans, huh?

18
00:01:54,442 --> 00:01:55,471
Not a one!

19
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,474
Not even breaking up with Janice?

20
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:02,248
Right, right. Shut up.

21
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:06,225
Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone.

22
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:10,262
Except for Kevin Millmore, may he rot in hell.

23
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,314
You just gotta do it.

24
00:02:12,314 --> 00:02:14,265
I know. But it's just so hard.

25
00:02:14,334 --> 00:02:17,326
You're sitting there with her. She has no idea.

26
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,237
You finally get up the courage to do it.

27
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,470
There's that awkward moment when you've handed her the note.

28
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:31,349
You try to run out of the restaurant before she's finished the note.

29
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:37,445
Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man. Just stop calling.

30
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,283
If you want, I'll do it with you.

31
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:45,262
She'd feel like we're ganging up on her.

32
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,493
You dump Janice, I'll dump Tony.

33
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,383
You're breaking up with Tony?

34
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:52,465
He's sweet, but it's not fun anymore.

35
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:57,306
I don't know if it's me or his hunger strike, I don't know.

36
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,243
Do you want anything else?

37
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:04,409
You had a nutty, chocolate-y, kind of cake-y, pie thing that--

38
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,221
Nothing. I'm fine.

39
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,449
What's wrong? Why so scrunchie?

40
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:17,218
My father wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.

41
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,356
That guy, he burns me up.

42
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,459
Yeah, it's a Mercedes if I move back home.

43
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,239
It was horrible! He called me ''young lady.''

44
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,275
I hate when my father calls me that.

45
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:34,242
Did he say ''You're not up to this'' again?

46
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:40,444
I got the extended version with choruses of ''You'll Never Make it on Your Own.''

48
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,483
Hi, Joey.

49
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,352
Oh, my God! Angela!

50
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,454
Wow! Being dumped by you agrees with her.

51
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,032
Are you gonna go over there?

52
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:56,500
No. Yeah. No.

53
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,396
Okay, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager.

54
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:09,406
One Mississippi, two Mississippi three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool.

56
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,834
Hey, Angela.

57
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:15,250
Joey.

58
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:16,413
You look good.

59
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:21,353
That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.

60
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,231
You don't say.

61
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,371
So, Rachel, what are you doing tonight?

62
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,466
Big glamour night. Me and Monica at Launderama.

63
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:44,280
You wanna hear a freakish coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?

64
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,479
Who?

65
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:46,474
Me!

66
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,244
Was that not clear?

67
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:53,450
Why don't...?

68
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:57,259
Why don't I just join you both there?

69
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,289
Don't you have a laundry room in your building?

70
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,292
Yes.

71
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:07,203
I do have a laundry room in my building.

72
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,433
But there's a rat problem.

73
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,405
Apparently, they're attracted to dryer sheets.

74
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:19,407
They're going in fine, but they're coming out all fluffy.

75
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,788
Anyway, 7-ish?

76
00:05:23,788 --> 00:05:25,221
Sure.

77
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:30,394
Forget it. I'm with Bob now.

78
00:05:30,394 --> 00:05:32,527
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?

79
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:37,464
Bob is great. He's smart, sophisticated, and he has a real job.

80
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,536
You go on three auditions a month and you're an actor. Bob--

81
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:45,335
Come on! We were great together.

82
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:50,338
And not just at the fun stuff, but, like, talking too.

83
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:57,449
Sorry, Joey. You said, ''Let's be friends.'' So guess what?

84
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,241
What?

85
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:00,225
We're just friends.

86
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,190
Fine. Fine.

87
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:06,197
Why don't the four of us have dinner tonight? As friends.

88
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,391
What ''four of us''?

89
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:14,238
You and Bob, and me and my girlfriend...Monica.

91
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,241
I'm telling you, this guy's perfect for you.

92
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:21,302
Forget it! Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.

93
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:31,422
Come on, this guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated and he has a real job.

96
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:35,517
I go on three auditions a month and say I'm an actor, but he's--

97
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:36,842
God help us.

98
00:06:36,842 --> 00:06:37,422
What?

99
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,364
Ugly Naked Guy is laying kitchen tile.

100
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,431
Look, I'm asking a favor here.

101
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:51,375
If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.

102
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:54,538
What's going on? You go out with tons of girls.

103
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:58,273
I know, but Angela's different.

104
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:03,481
She's like one of a kind, like a snowflake or....

105
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:07,291
Something else like a snowflake?

106
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,191
Yeah, yeah.

107
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:13,493
Look, I made a huge mistake. I never should've broke up with her.

108
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:16,292
Will you help me? Please?

109
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:28,304
Hold on a sec. You need to not touch any of those.

110
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:30,341
Okay, bye.

111
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:35,253
Monica's not coming. It's just gonna be me and Rachel.

112
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:40,248
Hold on, camper. You've thought this through?

113
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:44,227
It's laundry. The thinking-through is minimal.

114
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,455
Just you and Rachel? Just you two?

115
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:50,429
This is a date. You're going on a date.

116
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,851
Uh-uh.

117
00:07:53,851 --> 00:07:56,365
Uh-huh.

118
00:07:57,243 --> 00:07:59,711
I haven't done that in a while.

119
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:02,179
Is it a date if she doesn't know?

120
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:07,184
Yes, absolutely. Saturday night, all rules apply.

121
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:11,222
What are you saying? I should shave again? Pick up some wine?

122
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,192
Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear.

123
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:20,393
It's the first time she'll see your underwear. You want it dirty?

124
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,328
No.

125
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,297
And the fabric softener?

126
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:33,401
Okay, now what is wrong with my Snuggles?

127
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:37,341
What? It says I'm a sensitive, warm kind of guy.

128
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,442
You know, like a little fuzzy bear.

129
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,885
I'll pick something else up.

130
00:08:43,885 --> 00:08:45,415
There you go.

131
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,417
Thank you.

132
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:54,229
What does Bob look like? Is he tall, short?

133
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,424
Yep.

134
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:58,399
Which?

135
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,462
Which what?

136
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:02,821
You've never met Bob, have you?

137
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:04,368
No, but--

138
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:06,826
For all we know, he's horribly--

139
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:09,209
Hey, Joey!

140
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:13,309
Horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.

141
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,188
Where are they? Where are they?

142
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,490
This is nice. We never do anything, just the two of us.

143
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,394
Great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car, run over some puppies.

144
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:31,301
I don't wanna do that.

145
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,921
Here we go.

146
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:35,337
Have a good breakup.

147
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,261
Hey, Janice.

148
00:09:39,261 --> 00:09:41,212
My God, I am so glad you called me.

149
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:45,240
I had the most supremely awful day.

150
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,216
That's not good.

151
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,346
Can I get an espresso and a latte over here?

152
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:55,451
We got the proofs from the shoot with the vegetables. They sucked.

153
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,254
I blew off the afternoon. I went shopping.

154
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,267
And I got you....

155
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:05,337
I'm looking. I'm looking.

156
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:08,371
I'm looking.

157
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,339
I got you--

158
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:10,237
What?

159
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,941
What?

160
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:13,539
What did you get me there?

161
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:19,274
I got you these.

163
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,343
Bullwinkle socks.

164
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:22,820
That's sweet.

165
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,253
I knew you had Rockys.

166
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:29,455
You can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle or Rocky and Rocky, or you can mix.

167
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:34,364
Moose and squirrel. Whatever you want.

168
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:42,270
I'm gonna get another espresso. More latte?

169
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,570
No, I'm still working on mine.

170
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:52,850
That's it?

171
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,283
Yeah, it was really hard.

172
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,871
Yeah, the hug looked pretty brutal.

173
00:10:56,871 --> 00:10:59,322
You weren't there.

174
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,778
Sorry.

175
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:05,228
How are things going?

176
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:08,324
Going? Things are not going. She got me socks.

177
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:13,462
These go with your Rockys. She really cares about you-- I'm sorry.

178
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,477
Coming through. Move. Move!

179
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,488
Excuse me! I was kind of using that machine.

180
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,357
Yeah, well, now you're kind of not.

181
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,402
But I saved it. I put my basket on top.

182
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:47,370
I'm sorry. Is that your basket?

183
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:51,570
It's pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds!

184
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,268
What?

185
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:58,374
No suds, no save, okay?

186
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,412
What's going on?

187
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:06,423
Nothing. This horrible woman just took my machine.

188
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,318
Was your basket on top?

189
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:09,439
Yeah, but there were no suds.

190
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:10,451
So?

191
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,861
You know, no suds, no save.

192
00:12:12,861 --> 00:12:14,459
No suds, no-- Excuse me.

193
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:19,226
Hold on a second! This is my friend's machine.

194
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,363
Hey, hey, hey! Her stuff wasn't in it!

195
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:25,433
Hey, hey, hey! That's not the rule, and you know it!

196
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:37,481
All right. Show's over.

197
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:43,357
Nothing to see here.

198
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,388
Okay. Let's do laundry.

199
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,459
That was amazing! I can't even send back soup.

200
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:57,306
Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle....

201
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:02,413
Do you--? Do you--? Oh, hey. You must need detergent.

202
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:07,785
What's that?

203
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:09,218
Überweiss.

204
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:12,415
It's new. It's German. It's extra tough!

205
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:18,260
Rach, are you gonna separate those?

206
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:23,233
Oh, God. Am I being a total laundry spaz?

207
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:28,363
Am I supposed to use one machine for shirts and another for pants?

208
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,468
Have you never done this before?

209
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:38,342
Well, not myself. But I know other people that have.

210
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,448
Okay. You caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.

211
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:48,290
Don't worry. I'll use the gentle cycle.

212
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:56,266
Basically, you wanna use one machine for all your whites.

213
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,495
A whole other machine for your colors.

214
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:10,213
And a third for your delicates. That would be your bras and your underpanty things.

217
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:15,243
These are white cotton panties.

218
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:18,313
Would they go with whites or with delicates?

219
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,258
That would be a judgment call.

220
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,432
He's so cute!

221
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,233
Where did you grow up?

222
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,450
Brooklyn Heights.

223
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,530
Cleveland.

224
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:35,905
How'd that happen?

225
00:14:35,905 --> 00:14:36,536
My God!

226
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:38,435
What?

227
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:43,441
I suddenly had the feeling I was falling.

228
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,441
But I'm not.

229
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,385
So, you and Angela, huh?

230
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:58,430
Yep. Pretty much.

231
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,398
You're a lucky man.

232
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,493
Know what I miss most about her?

233
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:08,195
That cute nibbly noise she makes when she eats.

234
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:13,244
Like a happy little squirrel or a weasel.

236
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,325
I never really noticed.

237
00:15:16,325 --> 00:15:18,304
Oh, yeah, yeah. Listen for it.

238
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:21,252
Monica. Monica is great.

239
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:23,412
Yeah, she is.

240
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:27,420
But it's not gonna last.

241
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:31,225
She's too much for me in bed.

242
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,331
Sexually.

243
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,463
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.

244
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:40,364
Yeah, isn't he?

245
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:46,344
It's great to meet a smart, funny guy who's emotionally older than 8.

246
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:51,338
You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed!

247
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:58,382
My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.

248
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:02,385
That's nice.

249
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:09,433
You can. It's like pulling off a Band-Aid.

250
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:14,194
Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.

251
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,297
Go! Go!

252
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,445
Hi, Janice.

253
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:35,259
Here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore.

254
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,325
All right.

255
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,431
Well, there you go.

256
00:16:51,243 --> 00:16:54,269
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

257
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,474
This isn't about you.

258
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,309
I know! It's about your fear of commitment.

259
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,287
I'm not afraid.

260
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,287
Please.

261
00:17:04,287 --> 00:17:05,185
I don't!

262
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,237
I don't! I'm ready to commit anytime.

263
00:17:07,237 --> 00:17:09,250
Really?

264
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:21,399
I know this is gonna sound stupid but I feel that if I can do this if I can actually do my own laundry there isn't anything I can't do.

268
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,267
That does not sound stupid to me.

269
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:29,405
The first time I had to cook for myself after Carol left me--

270
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:34,248
I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross....

271
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:35,900
Uh-oh.

272
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,446
What?

273
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,246
Uh-oh....

274
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:41,417
Uh-oh, the laundry's done.

275
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,361
It's a song.

276
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,364
The laundry song we sing.

277
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:51,233
Uh-oh! The laundry's done

278
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,869
What's the matter?

279
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:54,268
Nothing.

280
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:55,431
The laundry's done

281
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,230
Come on, show me.

282
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:07,185
It's just that you left a red sock with your whites, and now...everything's kind of pink.

284
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,217
Everything's pink?

285
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,223
Except for the red sock, which is still red.

286
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,226
Don't be upset. It can happen to anyone.

287
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,285
But it happened to me.

288
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:21,197
God, I'm gonna look like a big Marshmallow Peep!

289
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,200
What am I doing?

290
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:26,328
My father's right! I can't live on my own.

291
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:29,407
I can't even do laundry!

292
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:46,220
Something went wrong with Underdog and they couldn't inflate his head.

293
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:53,230
So anyway...his head is flopping down Broadway, right?

295
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:58,328
And I'm thinking how inappropriate this is.

296
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:03,170
Something's in my eye. Could we check it in the light, please?

297
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,375
Oh, my God!

298
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,273
What?

299
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:13,283
Were we at the same table? It's like cocktails in Appalachia.

301
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,285
They're close.

302
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:21,281
Close? Her tongue's in his ear.

303
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:26,287
Like you've never got a little rambunctious with Ross.

304
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:33,398
Joey, this is sick. It's disgusting. It's not really true, is it?

306
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,400
Who's to say what's true?

307
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,475
What were you thinking?

308
00:19:37,475 --> 00:19:39,443
I'm not proud of this, okay?

309
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:43,204
Well, maybe I am a little.

310
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,332
I'm out of here!

311
00:19:44,332 --> 00:19:45,316
Wait!

312
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:49,251
You like him. I want her. He likes you.

313
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:50,836
Really?

314
00:19:50,836 --> 00:19:51,450
Yeah.

315
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:58,355
If we put our heads together, between the two of us we can break them up.

317
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,330
I'm sorry. I can't believe I did this.

318
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:07,428
I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.

319
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:17,247
Waiter? One more plate of chicken wings over here.

320
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:25,280
Here's the thing. We're different.

321
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,451
I'm bing, bing, bing. You're boom, boom, boom.

322
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,388
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry!

323
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,289
Are you okay?

324
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:37,299
It's just my lens. It's my lens.

325
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,394
I'll be right back.

326
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:43,466
I hit her in the eye! In the eye!

327
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,370
This is the worst breakup in the history of the world!

328
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:50,312
Oh, my God!

329
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,434
How many have you had?

330
00:20:53,434 --> 00:20:55,385
I don't know. A million!

331
00:20:56,388 --> 00:21:00,347
Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place.

332
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,308
I'm fine, I'm fine.

333
00:21:04,308 --> 00:21:05,354
All right.

334
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,927
I'm not fine. Here she is.

335
00:21:07,927 --> 00:21:10,424
Wait here, okay? Breathe.

336
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,370
How do you do that?

337
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,287
It's like a gift.

338
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:37,291
We should always break up together.

339
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,455
I'd like that!

340
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,457
The clothes are clean. That's the important part.

341
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:48,501
I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.

342
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:57,473
I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.

343
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,410
I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things.

344
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,250
Now, come on. Get out of my way.

345
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:07,224
I'm sorry. Maybe I wasn't being clear. This was our cart.

346
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,260
There weren't clothes in it!

347
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,262
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Quit making up rules!

348
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,323
Let go! Come on, it's my cart.

349
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:21,272
Listen, Mitzi, if you want it you're gonna have to take me with it!

351
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,827
Yes! Did you see that?

352
00:22:29,827 --> 00:22:31,374
You were incredible.

353
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:34,350
A brand-new woman, ladies and gentlemen.

354
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:38,254
Thank you. I could not have done this without you.

355
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,488
More clothes in the dryer?

356
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:50,934
I'm fine. I'm fine.

357
00:22:50,934 --> 00:22:52,367
Are you sure?

358
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:56,973
Are you sure you're okay?

359
00:22:56,973 --> 00:22:58,372
Yeah.

360
00:22:58,410 --> 00:22:59,906
Does it still hurt?

361
00:22:59,906 --> 00:23:01,402
Yeah.

362
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:07,412
What a neat idea! All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.

363
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:10,886
How'd it go?

364
00:23:10,886 --> 00:23:12,251
Excellent!

365
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:16,521
We ripped that couple apart and kept the pieces for ourselves.

366
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,329
What a beautiful story.

367
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,730
I'm fine, by the way.

368
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,226
I'm sorry.

369
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,766
Where's Chandler?

370
00:23:26,766 --> 00:23:28,262
He needed time to grieve.

371
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,433
I'm free! I'm free!

372
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,435
That ought to do it.
