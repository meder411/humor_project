1
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,887
There's nothing to tell.

2
00:00:57,887 --> 00:00:59,485
It's just some guy I work with.

3
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,228
You're going out with the guy.

4
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:03,391
There has to be something

5
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:04,454
wrong with him.

6
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,260
All right, Joey.

7
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,255
Be nice.

8
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,396
So does he have a hump

9
00:01:08,396 --> 00:01:09,459
and a hairpiece?

10
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,271
Wait, does he eat chalk?

11
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,887
I don't want her to go through

12
00:01:15,887 --> 00:01:17,434
what I did with Carl.

13
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:19,473
Okay, everybody relax.

14
00:01:19,473 --> 00:01:21,469
This is not even a date.

15
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,296
It's just two people going out

16
00:01:24,296 --> 00:01:26,344
to dinner and not having sex.

17
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:29,445
Sounds like a date to me.

18
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,857
I'm in high school,

19
00:01:32,857 --> 00:01:37,354
in the cafeteria and I realize I'm totally naked.

21
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,364
I've had that dream.

22
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,433
Then I look down and I realize

23
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:46,462
there is a phone...there.

25
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:49,358
Instead of--

26
00:01:49,358 --> 00:01:50,308
That's right!

27
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,274
Never had that one.

28
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:54,394
All of a sudden,

29
00:01:54,394 --> 00:01:56,476
the phone starts to ring.

30
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,432
What do I do?

31
00:01:58,432 --> 00:01:59,581
Everyone starts looking at me.

32
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,414
They weren't looking at you before?

33
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,374
Finally, I figure

34
00:02:05,374 --> 00:02:07,325
I'd better answer it.

35
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:11,329
And it turns out it's my mother.

36
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,393
Which is very, very weird

37
00:02:13,393 --> 00:02:15,389
because she never calls me.

38
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,271
Hi.

39
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,795
He says, ''Hello,''

40
00:02:26,795 --> 00:02:28,245
I want to kill myself.

41
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,271
You okay?

42
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,366
I feel like someone pulled my

43
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:38,304
intestine out of my mouth and tied it around my neck.

45
00:02:38,304 --> 00:02:40,352
Cookie?

46
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,394
Carol moved her stuff out today.

47
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,976
Let me get you some coffee.

48
00:02:44,976 --> 00:02:46,489
Thanks.

49
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,867
No, don't!

50
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:55,364
Stop cleansing my aura.

51
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,858
Just leave my aura alone, okay?

52
00:02:57,858 --> 00:03:00,241
Fine, be murky.

53
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,330
I'll be fine. I hope she'll be happy.

54
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:04,247
No, you don't.

55
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:05,881
No, I don't.

56
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:07,445
To hell with her. She left me!

57
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,416
You never knew she was a lesbian?

58
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,228
No! Okay?

59
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,825
Why does everyone

60
00:03:17,825 --> 00:03:19,321
keep fixating on that?

61
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,400
She didn't know.

62
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,334
How should I know?

63
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:29,330
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

64
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,268
Did I say that out loud?

65
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,331
I told Mom and Dad last night.

66
00:03:36,331 --> 00:03:38,282
They took it pretty well.

67
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,373
Oh, really?

68
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,403
So that hysterical phone call

69
00:03:41,403 --> 00:03:45,840
from a woman sobbing ''I'll never have grandchildren,''

71
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,291
was what? A wrong number?

72
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,350
Sorry.

73
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,413
Look, you're feeling

74
00:03:51,413 --> 00:03:53,364
a lot of pain right now.

75
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,882
You're angry.

76
00:03:54,882 --> 00:03:56,298
You're hurting.

77
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:57,415
Can I tell you what

78
00:03:57,415 --> 00:03:58,461
the answer is?

79
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,233
Strip joints!

80
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,354
Hey, you're single.

81
00:04:03,354 --> 00:04:04,400
Have some hormones.

82
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:06,827
But I don't want

83
00:04:06,827 --> 00:04:08,209
to be single, okay?

84
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:11,408
I just want to be married again.

85
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:19,419
And I just want a million dollars!

86
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,927
Rachel?

87
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:26,525
Oh, Monica! Thank God!

88
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:31,286
I went to your building and a guy with a hammer

90
00:04:31,286 --> 00:04:33,237
said you'd be here, and you are.

91
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,307
Can I get you some coffee?

92
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:37,275
Decaf.

93
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:39,411
Everybody, this is Rachel,

94
00:04:39,411 --> 00:04:41,345
a Lincoln High survivor.

95
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,814
This is everybody.

96
00:04:42,814 --> 00:04:45,345
Chandler and Phoebe Joey.

98
00:04:45,345 --> 00:04:46,340
Remember my brother, Ross?

99
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,476
Sure!

100
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,880
You want to tell us now, or are we

101
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,297
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

102
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,854
Well, it started about

103
00:05:05,854 --> 00:05:08,305
a half-hour before the wedding.

104
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,858
I was in the room

105
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:14,296
with all the presents and I was looking at this

107
00:05:14,296 --> 00:05:17,248
really gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.

108
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,217
When all of a sudden--

109
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,308
Sweet 'N Low?

110
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,434
I realized I was more turned on by

111
00:05:24,434 --> 00:05:26,413
this gravy boat than Barry.

112
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:27,976
I got freaked out,

113
00:05:27,976 --> 00:05:29,426
and it hit me:

114
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,326
How much Barry looks

115
00:05:31,326 --> 00:05:32,423
like Mr. Potato Head.

116
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:34,913
I always knew

117
00:05:34,913 --> 00:05:36,460
he looked familiar, but....

118
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,886
I had to get out of there,

119
00:05:40,886 --> 00:05:44,426
and I started wondering ''Why am I doing this,''

121
00:05:44,426 --> 00:05:46,377
and ''Who am I doing it for?''

122
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,442
I didn't know where to go,

123
00:05:48,442 --> 00:05:52,801
and I know we've drifted apart but you're the only person

125
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:54,251
I know here.

126
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,902
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.

127
00:05:56,902 --> 00:05:59,450
I hoped that wouldn't be an issue.

128
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,722
I guess he bought her the pipe organ,

129
00:06:18,722 --> 00:06:21,202
and she's really not happy about it.

130
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:22,864
''Tuna or egg salad!

131
00:06:22,864 --> 00:06:24,314
Decide!''

132
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,902
''I'll have whatever

133
00:06:27,902 --> 00:06:30,353
Christina's having.''

134
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,323
Daddy, I just--

135
00:06:32,323 --> 00:06:34,223
I can't marry him.

136
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,840
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,320
I just don't love him.

138
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:43,425
Well, it matters to me!

139
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:47,903
''If I let go of my hair,

140
00:06:47,903 --> 00:06:50,468
my head will fall off.''

141
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:53,411
She should not be

142
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:55,345
wearing those pants.

143
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,281
Push her down the stairs!

144
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,883
Push her!

145
00:06:58,883 --> 00:07:00,316
Push her down the stairs!

146
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,325
Come on, Daddy, listen!

147
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,242
All my life, everyone's

148
00:07:10,242 --> 00:07:12,290
always told me, ''You're a shoe!''

149
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:14,492
''You're a shoe!''

150
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:18,226
What if I don't want to be a shoe?

151
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:21,296
What if I want to be a purse?

152
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:24,240
Or a hat?

153
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,809
No, I don't want you

154
00:07:25,809 --> 00:07:27,208
to buy me a hat!

155
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:30,339
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

156
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,413
You can see where he'd have trouble.

157
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:37,305
Look, Daddy,

158
00:07:37,305 --> 00:07:38,255
it's my life.

159
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,342
Well, maybe I'll just stay

160
00:07:41,342 --> 00:07:43,259
here with Monica.

161
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,878
I guess we've established

162
00:07:46,878 --> 00:07:48,425
she's staying with Monica.

163
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:52,328
Well, maybe that's my decision.

164
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,463
Maybe I don't need your money.

165
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:56,808
Wait!

166
00:07:56,808 --> 00:07:58,275
I said maybe!

167
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,287
Just breathe. That's it.

168
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,188
Try to think of nice, calm things.

169
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,837
Raindrops on roses

170
00:08:12,837 --> 00:08:14,384
And whiskers on kittens

171
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:17,258
Doorbells and sleigh bells

172
00:08:17,258 --> 00:08:19,288
And something with mittens

173
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:21,831
La la la something

174
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:23,429
And noodles with string

175
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,237
I'm all better now.

176
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,402
I helped.

177
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:34,242
This is probably for the best.

178
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,313
Independence. Controlling your life.

179
00:08:37,313 --> 00:08:39,412
The whole hat thing.

180
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:43,479
You can always come to Joey.

181
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,838
Me and Chandler live across the hall.

182
00:08:45,838 --> 00:08:47,419
He's away a lot.

183
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:50,844
Stop hitting on her!

184
00:08:50,844 --> 00:08:52,260
It's her wedding day.

185
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,423
Like there's a rule, or something?

186
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:00,199
I got it.

187
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,870
Please don't do that again.

188
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,434
It's a horrible sound.

189
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,369
It's Paul.

190
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,725
Oh, God, is it 6:30?

191
00:09:07,725 --> 00:09:09,272
Buzz him in.

192
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,781
Who's Paul?

193
00:09:10,781 --> 00:09:12,180
Paul, the wine guy?

194
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,274
Maybe.

195
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,866
Your ''not a real date''

196
00:09:14,866 --> 00:09:16,413
is with Paul, the wine guy?

197
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,252
He finally asked you out?

198
00:09:18,252 --> 00:09:19,315
Yes!

199
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,225
It's a ''Dear Diary'' moment.

200
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,842
Rach, I can cancel.

201
00:09:23,842 --> 00:09:25,389
Please, go, I'll be fine.

202
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,780
Ross, are you okay?

203
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,327
Do you want me to stay?

204
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,337
That'd be good.

205
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,403
Really?

206
00:09:36,403 --> 00:09:38,399
Go on! It's Paul, the wine guy!

207
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,337
Does he sell it, drink it?

208
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,349
Or he just complains a lot?

209
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,816
Hi, come in!

210
00:09:45,816 --> 00:09:49,367
Paul, this is...everybody.

212
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:50,413
Everybody, this is Paul.

213
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,337
The wine guy.

214
00:09:54,337 --> 00:09:56,316
I didn't catch your name. Paul?

215
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,743
I'll be right back.

216
00:09:59,743 --> 00:10:01,256
I've just gotta go--

217
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,427
A-wandering?

218
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,260
Change.

219
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:06,417
Sit down.

220
00:10:06,417 --> 00:10:07,463
Two seconds.

221
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,860
I just pulled out four eyelashes.

222
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,243
That can't be good.

223
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,352
Hey, Paul, here's a tip.

224
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,822
She really likes it when you

225
00:10:24,822 --> 00:10:30,261
rub her neck in the same spot until it starts to get red.

227
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,457
Shut up, Joey!

228
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,291
What are you up to tonight?

229
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:38,867
I was supposed to be headed

230
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:43,366
for Aruba on my honeymoon so, nothing.

232
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,990
Right. You're not even

233
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,503
getting your honeymoon.

234
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,395
Although, Aruba.

235
00:10:49,395 --> 00:10:50,510
This time of year?

236
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:57,285
Talk about your big lizards.

238
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,925
If you don't want

239
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:04,345
to be alone tonight Joey and Chandler are

241
00:11:04,345 --> 00:11:06,262
helping me with my furniture.

242
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,459
We're very excited about it.

243
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,748
Thanks. But I'm just

244
00:11:10,748 --> 00:11:12,261
going to hang out here.

245
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:13,366
It's been a long day.

246
00:11:13,366 --> 00:11:14,361
Oh, sure.

247
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,236
Pheebs, wanna help?

248
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,326
I wish I could,

249
00:11:18,326 --> 00:11:20,277
but I don't want to.

250
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,323
Love is sweet as summer showers

251
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:34,292
Love is a wondrous work of art

252
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,378
But your love

253
00:11:37,378 --> 00:11:40,296
Oh, your love, your love

254
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:44,462
Is like a giant pigeon

255
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,468
Crapping on my heart

256
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,278
Thank you.

257
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,433
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y

258
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:07,340
thing to the side things using a bunch of these

260
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,455
little worm guys.

261
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:12,394
I have no bracket-y thing.

262
00:12:12,394 --> 00:12:17,464
I see no worm guys whatsoever and I cannot feel my legs.

264
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,291
We got a bookcase.

265
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,242
It's beautiful.

266
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,241
What's this?

267
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,776
I would have to say

268
00:12:29,776 --> 00:12:32,273
that is an L-shaped bracket.

269
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,447
Which goes where?

270
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:36,443
I have no idea.

271
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:39,970
Done with the bookcase.

272
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:41,483
All finished.

273
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,290
This was Carol's favorite beer.

274
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,280
She always drank it out of the can.

275
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,259
I should have known.

276
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,905
Start with that, we're out of here.

277
00:12:58,905 --> 00:13:01,402
Please don't spoil all this fun.

278
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,311
Let me ask you.

279
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,397
She got the furniture,

280
00:13:05,397 --> 00:13:07,445
the stereo, the good TV.

281
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,448
What did you get?

282
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,735
You guys.

283
00:13:11,735 --> 00:13:13,248
You got screwed.

284
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:15,424
Oh, my God.

285
00:13:15,424 --> 00:13:17,523
I know. I'm such an idiot.

286
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,346
I should've known when she went to

287
00:13:20,346 --> 00:13:22,428
the dentist five times a week.

288
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,265
I mean, how clean can teeth get?

289
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,430
My brother's going through that.

290
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,366
How did you get over it?

291
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,375
He might accidentally

292
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,275
break something valuable of hers.

293
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,311
Say her--

294
00:13:34,311 --> 00:13:35,243
Leg?

295
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:37,315
That's one way of doing it.

296
00:13:37,315 --> 00:13:39,283
I went for the watch.

297
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,352
You actually broke her watch?

298
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,418
The worst I ever did was shred

299
00:13:44,418 --> 00:13:46,448
my old boyfriend's favorite towel.

300
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:48,823
Steer clear of you.

301
00:13:48,823 --> 00:13:50,387
That's right.

302
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,781
Barry, I'm sorry.

303
00:13:52,781 --> 00:13:54,265
I am so sorry.

304
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,914
You probably think it's about making

305
00:13:56,914 --> 00:13:59,462
love with your socks on, but it isn't.

306
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,319
It's about me.

307
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:02,399
And I just--

308
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,811
The machine cut me off again.

309
00:14:10,811 --> 00:14:12,307
Anyway....

310
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,753
I know that some lucky girl is going

311
00:14:19,753 --> 00:14:22,250
to become Mrs. Barry Finkel.

312
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,279
But it isn't me.

313
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:26,230
It's not me.

314
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,380
Not that I have any idea who ''me'' is

315
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,428
right now, but you just--

316
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,431
I'm divorced.

317
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:38,256
I'm only 26, and I'm divorced!

318
00:14:38,256 --> 00:14:41,271
Shut up!

319
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:48,282
That only took me an hour.

320
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:52,320
We haven't had a relationship

321
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,352
that's lasted longer than a Mento.

322
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,809
You have had the love of a woman

323
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:00,322
for four years.

324
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,300
Four years of closeness and sharing,

325
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,201
after which she ripped your heart out.

326
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,230
That is why we don't do it!

327
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,336
I don't think that was my point!

328
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,425
Know what's scary? What if there's

329
00:15:15,425 --> 00:15:17,438
only one woman for everybody?

330
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,730
I mean, what if you get one

331
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,243
woman, and that's it?

332
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,817
Unfortunately, in my case,

333
00:15:23,817 --> 00:15:26,314
there was only one woman for her.

334
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:29,874
What are you talking about?

335
00:15:29,874 --> 00:15:31,421
One woman.

336
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:33,895
That's like saying there's only

337
00:15:33,895 --> 00:15:35,459
one flavor of ice cream.

338
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,248
Let me tell you something.

339
00:15:38,248 --> 00:15:40,261
There's lots of flavors out there.

340
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,335
Rocky road and cookie dough

341
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,331
and bing cherry vanilla.

342
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,357
You can get them with jimmies

343
00:15:47,357 --> 00:15:49,370
or nuts or whipped cream.

344
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,312
It's the best thing

345
00:15:51,312 --> 00:15:52,375
to happen to you!

346
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:54,463
You got married.

347
00:15:54,463 --> 00:15:56,442
You were like, what, 8?

348
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,340
Welcome back to the world.

349
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,291
Grab a spoon!

350
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,810
I don't know if I'm hungry or horny.

351
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:06,193
Then stay out of my freezer.

352
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,295
Ever since she walked out on me....

353
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,407
What?

354
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,301
You wanna spell it out with noodles?

355
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,861
It's more of a fifth date

356
00:16:20,861 --> 00:16:23,312
kind of revelation.

357
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,783
So there's going to be

358
00:16:25,783 --> 00:16:28,217
a fifth date?

359
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:29,447
Isn't there?

360
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:31,268
Yeah, yeah.

361
00:16:31,268 --> 00:16:32,314
I think there is.

362
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:37,252
What were you going to say?

363
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:49,339
Ever since she left me I haven't been able to perform sexually.

366
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:52,939
Oh, God!

367
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:54,435
I'm so sorry.

368
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,880
Being spit on is probably

369
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,280
not what you need right now.

370
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,216
How long?

371
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,817
Two years.

372
00:17:03,817 --> 00:17:05,313
Wow.

373
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:09,384
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

374
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,826
So you still think you might

375
00:17:12,826 --> 00:17:15,323
want that fifth date?

376
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,215
Yeah.

377
00:17:19,215 --> 00:17:21,228
Yeah, I do.

378
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,920
We are gathered here

379
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:29,346
to join Joanie Louise Cunningham and Charles.

381
00:17:29,346 --> 00:17:37,217
Chachi, Chachi, Chachi in the bonds of holy matrimony.

383
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,278
See!

384
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:41,355
But Joanie loved Chachi.

385
00:17:41,355 --> 00:17:44,353
That's the difference.

386
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,264
''Grab a spoon.''

387
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,879
Do you know how long it's been

388
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:50,426
since I grabbed a spoon?

389
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,301
Do the words, ''Billy, don't be

390
00:17:53,301 --> 00:17:55,366
a hero,'' mean anything to you?

391
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,728
Great story.

392
00:18:00,728 --> 00:18:02,212
But I gotta go.

393
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,749
I got a date with Andrea.

394
00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:07,217
Angela. No, Andrea.

395
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,850
Andrea's the screamer.

396
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,414
Angela has cats.

397
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,289
Right, thanks. It's Julie.

398
00:18:13,289 --> 00:18:15,388
I'm out of here.

399
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:19,277
Here's the thing. Even if

400
00:18:19,277 --> 00:18:26,236
I could get it together enough to ask a woman out who am I going to ask?

403
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,313
Isn't this amazing?

404
00:18:52,313 --> 00:18:54,264
I've never made coffee in my life.

405
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:55,412
That is amazing.

406
00:18:55,412 --> 00:18:56,458
Congratulations.

407
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,867
If I can make coffee,

408
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:00,465
there isn't anything I can't do.

409
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:03,870
I think it's, ''If I can invade Poland,

410
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,367
there's nothing I can't do.''

411
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,862
If you feel like you have to make

412
00:19:08,862 --> 00:19:11,313
a Western omelet or something....

413
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,900
Although, actually

414
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,481
I'm really not that hungry.

415
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:20,771
Oh, good.

416
00:19:20,771 --> 00:19:22,318
Lenny and Squiggy are here.

417
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,207
Good morning.

418
00:19:24,207 --> 00:19:25,219
Good morning.

419
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:28,216
Morning.

420
00:19:28,216 --> 00:19:29,200
Morning, Paul.

421
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,768
Hello, Paul.

422
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:32,235
Hi. Paul, is it?

423
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,778
Thank you so much.

424
00:19:40,778 --> 00:19:42,245
Stop.

425
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,379
Last night was like

426
00:19:44,379 --> 00:19:48,332
all my birthdays, both graduations plus the barn-raising scene

428
00:19:48,332 --> 00:19:49,412
in Witness.

429
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,520
We'll talk later.

430
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,528
Thank you.

431
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:14,337
That wasn't a real date.

432
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,909
What the hell do you do

433
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:17,439
on a real date?

434
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,475
Shut up and put my table back.

435
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,355
I've got to get to work.

436
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,324
If I don't input those numbers,

437
00:20:27,324 --> 00:20:30,259
it doesn't make much of a difference.

438
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,459
So, like, you guys all have jobs?

439
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,334
Yeah, we all have jobs.

440
00:20:39,334 --> 00:20:41,399
That's how we buy stuff.

441
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,488
Yeah, I'm an actor.

442
00:20:45,488 --> 00:20:47,501
Have I seen you in anything?

443
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,326
I doubt it.

444
00:20:49,326 --> 00:20:50,372
Mostly regional work.

445
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:52,349
Unless you saw the Wee One's

446
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:55,803
production of Pinocchio at the little theater

448
00:20:55,803 --> 00:20:57,287
in the park?

449
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,481
It was a job!

450
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,370
''Look, Geppetto.

451
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,416
I'm a real live boy.''

452
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,342
I will not take this abuse.

453
00:21:06,342 --> 00:21:08,321
You're right, I'm sorry.

454
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:09,817
Once I was a wooden boy

455
00:21:09,817 --> 00:21:11,267
A little wooden boy

456
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,451
You should both know

457
00:21:15,451 --> 00:21:17,464
that he's a dead man.

458
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,234
Oh, Chandler!

459
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:23,410
How are you doing today?

460
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,439
Sleep okay?

461
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,517
Did you talk to Barry?

462
00:21:26,517 --> 00:21:28,485
I can't stop smiling.

463
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:31,319
I see that. You look like you

464
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:33,384
slept with a hanger in your mouth.

465
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:39,859
I know.

466
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:41,355
He's just so....

467
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,984
Remember you and Tony Demarco?

468
00:21:42,984 --> 00:21:44,468
Oh, yeah.

469
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,454
Well, it's like that.

470
00:21:46,454 --> 00:21:48,405
With feelings.

471
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,892
Wow, are you in trouble!

472
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,376
Big time!

473
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,442
Want a wedding dress?

474
00:21:54,442 --> 00:21:56,307
Hardly used.

475
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:57,945
I think we're getting a little

476
00:21:57,945 --> 00:21:59,509
ahead of ourselves.

477
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,334
I'm going to get up, go to work,

478
00:22:02,334 --> 00:22:04,416
and not think about him all day.

479
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,920
Or else I'm going to get up

480
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,416
and go to work.

481
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,410
Wish me luck!

482
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,360
What for?

483
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,829
I'm gonna go get one

484
00:22:12,829 --> 00:22:15,229
of those job things.

485
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,390
Hi, Monica.

486
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,436
Franny, welcome back.

487
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,394
How was Florida?

488
00:22:29,394 --> 00:22:31,242
You had sex, didn't you?

489
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:34,314
How do you do that?

490
00:22:34,314 --> 00:22:35,343
I hate you.

491
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:37,383
I'm pushing my aunt through

492
00:22:37,383 --> 00:22:39,379
Parrot Jungle, you're having sex.

493
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,484
So, who?

494
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,454
You know Paul?

495
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:46,810
Paul, the wine guy?

496
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,357
Yeah, I know Paul.

497
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:51,968
You mean, you know Paul

498
00:22:51,968 --> 00:22:53,367
like I know Paul?

499
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:54,467
What?

500
00:22:54,467 --> 00:22:55,462
I take credit for Paul.

501
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:58,253
Before me, there was no snap in his

502
00:22:58,253 --> 00:23:00,232
turtle for two years.

503
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,215
Of course it was a line.

504
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,768
Why would anybody

505
00:23:07,768 --> 00:23:09,218
do something like that?

506
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:10,834
I assume we want an answer

507
00:23:10,834 --> 00:23:12,347
more sophisticated than:

508
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:15,416
''To get you into bed.''

509
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,258
I hate men.

510
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,343
Don't hate. You don't want

511
00:23:20,343 --> 00:23:22,356
to put that out into the universe.

512
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,264
Is it me?

513
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,287
Is it like I have some sort of

514
00:23:26,287 --> 00:23:29,403
beacon that only dogs and men with emotional problems

516
00:23:29,403 --> 00:23:30,466
can hear?

517
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:32,806
Come here.

518
00:23:32,806 --> 00:23:34,336
Give me your feet.

519
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,444
I just thought he was nice, you know?

520
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,521
I can't believe

521
00:23:48,521 --> 00:23:50,551
you didn't know it was a line.

522
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,333
Guess what?

523
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,300
You got a job?

524
00:23:56,368 --> 00:23:58,381
Are you kidding?

525
00:23:58,381 --> 00:24:00,394
I'm trained for nothing.

526
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:02,821
I was laughed out of 1 2 interviews.

527
00:24:02,821 --> 00:24:04,436
You're surprisingly upbeat.

528
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:06,773
You'd be too,

529
00:24:06,773 --> 00:24:10,347
if you found these boots on sale 50% off.

531
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:13,407
How well you know me.

532
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,266
They're my

533
00:24:16,266 --> 00:24:19,413
''I don't need a job I've got great boots'' boots.

535
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,288
How did you pay?

536
00:24:22,288 --> 00:24:23,317
Credit card.

537
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,363
And who pays for that?

538
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,366
My father.

539
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:33,901
Is this really necessary?

540
00:24:33,901 --> 00:24:35,465
I can stop charging any time.

541
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,334
You can't live off your parents.

542
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:40,327
I know that.

543
00:24:40,327 --> 00:24:42,278
That's why I was getting married.

544
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:44,395
Give her a break.

545
00:24:44,395 --> 00:24:46,243
It's hard being on your own.

546
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:47,340
Thank you.

547
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:48,966
I remember when I first

548
00:24:48,966 --> 00:24:50,547
came to this city, I was 1 4.

549
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,773
Mom had killed herself,

550
00:24:52,773 --> 00:24:54,257
stepdad was in jail.

551
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,293
I didn't know anybody here.

552
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:58,794
I ended up living with this albino

553
00:24:58,794 --> 00:25:01,194
guy who was cleaning windshields.

554
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:03,199
And then he killed himself.

555
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:05,400
Then I found aromatherapy.

556
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,499
So I know exactly how you feel.

557
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,436
The word you're looking for is:

558
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,213
''Anyway....''

559
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:22,817
You ready?

560
00:25:22,817 --> 00:25:24,415
No, how can I be ready?

561
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,990
''Ready to jump out of the plane

562
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,457
with no parachute?''

563
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:29,238
I can't do this.

564
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:30,250
I know you can.

565
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:31,841
No.

566
00:25:31,841 --> 00:25:33,354
You made coffee, you can do anything.

567
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:39,226
Cut. Cut. Cut.

568
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,857
You know what?

569
00:25:45,857 --> 00:25:47,438
I think we can leave it at that.

570
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,542
Kind of a symbolic gesture.

571
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:51,538
Rachel, that was a library card.

572
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:00,890
If you listen closely, you can hear

573
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:03,324
a thousand retailers scream.

574
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,298
Welcome to the real world!

575
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,913
It sucks.

576
00:26:09,913 --> 00:26:11,426
You're gonna love it.

577
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,924
That's it.

578
00:26:20,924 --> 00:26:22,437
Are you going to crash on the couch?

579
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:25,210
No, I gotta go home sometime.

580
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,206
Are you gonna be okay?

581
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,767
Look what I just

582
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:32,314
found on the floor.

583
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,418
What?

584
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:36,477
That's Paul's watch.

585
00:26:36,477 --> 00:26:38,428
Just put it back where you found it.

586
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:41,344
Oh, boy!

587
00:26:41,344 --> 00:26:42,356
All right.

588
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,399
Good night, everybody.

589
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:46,264
Good night.

590
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,782
I'm sorry. Have it, I don't want it.

591
00:26:58,782 --> 00:27:01,216
Split it?

592
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:06,870
You probably didn't know this,

593
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:11,387
but in high school I had a major crush on you.

595
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,290
I knew.

596
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:17,391
You did?

597
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,767
I figured you thought

598
00:27:19,767 --> 00:27:21,331
I was Monica's geeky brother.

599
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,397
I did.

600
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,213
Listen, do you think...?

601
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,745
Try not to let my vulnerability

602
00:27:32,745 --> 00:27:35,242
become a factor here.

603
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:37,483
Do you think it would be okay

604
00:27:37,483 --> 00:27:39,513
if I asked you out sometime?

605
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:43,222
Yeah.

606
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,352
Maybe.

607
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:48,423
Okay.

608
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,261
Okay, maybe I will.

609
00:27:58,376 --> 00:27:59,889
Good night.

610
00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:01,402
Good night.

611
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,218
See you.

612
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,762
Wait, wait.

613
00:28:19,762 --> 00:28:21,195
What's with you?

614
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:27,428
I just grabbed a spoon.

615
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,225
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

616
00:28:36,225 --> 00:28:38,238
-Can't believe what I'm hearing

617
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:39,328
What? I said--

618
00:28:39,328 --> 00:28:40,340
-What? I said

619
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,818
Would you stop?

620
00:28:42,818 --> 00:28:44,217
Was I doing it again?

621
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:46,347
Yes!

622
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,892
I said you had a nice butt.

623
00:28:48,892 --> 00:28:51,326
It's just not a great butt.

624
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,392
You won't know a butt if it bit you.

625
00:28:53,392 --> 00:28:55,422
There's an image.

626
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:01,261
Would anybody like more coffee?

627
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:03,336
You made it,

628
00:29:03,336 --> 00:29:04,365
or you're serving it?

629
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,360
I'm just serving it.

630
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,311
I'll have a cup of coffee.

631
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:10,210
Kids, new dream.

632
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,305
I'm in Las Vegas.

633
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:14,283
Miss, more coffee?

634
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,370
Could you give this

635
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,321
to that guy over there?

636
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,305
Go ahead.

637
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:21,420
Thank you.

638
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:23,290
Sorry.

639
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,387
Okay, Las Vegas.

640
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:27,187
I'm in Las Vegas.

641
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,292
I'm Liza Minnelli....
