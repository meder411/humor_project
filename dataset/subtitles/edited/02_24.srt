1
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:03,883
How was the audition?

2
00:00:03,883 --> 00:00:05,265
Incredible.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,433
You won't believe

4
00:00:06,433 --> 00:00:07,496
who the director was.

5
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:09,802
Who?

6
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:11,298
I'll give you one hint:

7
00:00:11,376 --> 00:00:13,401
Warren Beatty.

8
00:00:13,478 --> 00:00:14,467
Wow.

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,776
There's just one thing

10
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:18,272
that might be a problem.

11
00:00:18,383 --> 00:00:20,510
See, I had to kiss this guy.

12
00:00:21,286 --> 00:00:23,516
Because he was just so darn cute?

13
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:28,425
No, I'm up for the part of this guy who the main guy kisses.

14
00:00:28,493 --> 00:00:30,944
Well, you're an actor. I say

15
00:00:30,944 --> 00:00:33,395
you just suck it up and you do it.

16
00:00:37,302 --> 00:00:38,599
Or you just do it.

17
00:00:39,438 --> 00:00:41,497
I did do it. I'm a professional.

18
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,024
My first girlfriend

19
00:00:43,024 --> 00:00:46,027
was Lisa DiBatista so I'm no stranger

20
00:00:46,027 --> 00:00:47,511
to the mustache.

21
00:00:48,413 --> 00:00:49,437
What's the problem?

22
00:00:49,514 --> 00:00:52,028
After the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up

23
00:00:52,028 --> 00:00:54,542
and says, ''Good actor. Bad kisser.''

24
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,833
Can you believe that?

25
00:00:56,833 --> 00:00:58,346
Me, not a good kisser.

26
00:00:58,457 --> 00:01:02,485
That's like Mother Teresa, not a good mother.

27
00:01:04,362 --> 00:01:06,353
Who cares what that guy thinks?

28
00:01:06,398 --> 00:01:07,928
What does Warren Beatty

29
00:01:07,928 --> 00:01:09,458
know about kissing?

30
00:02:01,286 --> 00:02:03,282
What did your agent say?

31
00:02:03,282 --> 00:02:05,278
The kiss is definitely a problem.

32
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,921
Mr. Beatty wants to see it again.

33
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:10,452
I gotta find out what I'm doing wrong.

34
00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:12,012
One of you girls

35
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:13,462
come over here and kiss me.

36
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:15,383
Forget it.

37
00:02:15,383 --> 00:02:16,367
Yeah, right.

38
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:17,396
Come on.

39
00:02:17,396 --> 00:02:18,391
I need your help here.

40
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,421
I'll do it. I've kissed him before.

41
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:22,372
I can do it again.

42
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:24,408
See this? This is a friend.

43
00:02:24,476 --> 00:02:26,467
Let's go.

44
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:29,309
Oh, wait. I have gum.

45
00:02:30,315 --> 00:02:31,407
Okay.

46
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:42,392
Good. Very good. Firm, but tender.

47
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:44,486
I'd recommend you to a friend.

48
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,981
I don't know what the problem is.

49
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:50,432
Maybe you're not used to kissing men.

50
00:02:50,535 --> 00:02:52,486
Maybe you just tensed up.

51
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:54,437
Maybe you need to work on that.

52
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:57,400
Yeah, that makes sense.

53
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,440
Over my dead body.

54
00:03:07,452 --> 00:03:08,965
And I'll be using

55
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:10,478
his dead body as a shield.

56
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,375
Come on out.

57
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:17,490
I'm telling you, you look good.

58
00:03:18,263 --> 00:03:19,810
Tell her she looks good.

59
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,357
Tell her she looks good.

60
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:28,405
Oh, my God!

61
00:03:30,408 --> 00:03:32,501
You look so good!

62
00:03:34,312 --> 00:03:36,308
I cannot believe I have to walk

63
00:03:36,308 --> 00:03:40,395
in front of 200 people looking like something

64
00:03:40,395 --> 00:03:42,374
you drink when you're nauseous.

65
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,904
So don't.

66
00:03:43,904 --> 00:03:45,388
I don't see why we have to go.

67
00:03:45,423 --> 00:03:47,903
It's your ex-fiancÃ©'s wedding.

68
00:03:47,903 --> 00:03:50,383
Because I promised Mindy I would.

69
00:03:50,428 --> 00:03:51,958
Yeah, well, you promised Barry

70
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,488
you'd marry him.

71
00:03:54,532 --> 00:03:56,028
You guys, I have to go.

72
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,524
I'm the maid of honor.

73
00:03:58,303 --> 00:03:59,867
Besides, I need to be in a room

74
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:04,265
again with these people and feel good about myself.

75
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,418
You have the same clothes on

76
00:04:14,418 --> 00:04:16,386
as last night. Get some action?

77
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:17,443
I may have.

78
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:19,388
Stud!

79
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:21,925
What's she look like?

80
00:04:21,925 --> 00:04:23,358
We haven't met.

81
00:04:23,395 --> 00:04:24,879
We just stayed up talking

82
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:26,363
on the Internet.

83
00:04:27,265 --> 00:04:28,254
Geek!

84
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:30,797
I like this girl.

85
00:04:30,797 --> 00:04:32,293
I seriously like this girl.

86
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,934
Know how I tend to get

87
00:04:33,934 --> 00:04:35,498
a little defended and quippy?

88
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:37,320
Get out!

89
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,366
No! Please.

90
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,844
Well, she called me on it, okay?

91
00:04:40,844 --> 00:04:43,278
She said, ''Cut it out, get real.''

92
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:44,505
And I did.

93
00:04:45,317 --> 00:04:46,409
Wow.

94
00:04:46,484 --> 00:04:48,418
What's that like?

95
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:52,381
It's like this. Me.

96
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,321
No jokes.

97
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:55,908
Stop it.

98
00:04:55,908 --> 00:04:57,290
You're freaking me out.

99
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,364
I don't like you this way.

100
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,233
I'll see you guys later.

101
00:05:03,268 --> 00:05:03,865
Bye, Richard.

102
00:05:03,865 --> 00:05:04,462
Bye-bye.

103
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:07,288
Bye, sweetie. I love you.

104
00:05:07,288 --> 00:05:09,239
I love you too.

105
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:17,798
I think my boyfriend's

106
00:05:17,798 --> 00:05:19,248
ever so dreamy.

107
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:21,314
I wonder what our wedding

108
00:05:21,314 --> 00:05:22,377
will be like.

109
00:05:24,255 --> 00:05:26,303
What do you mean? What wedding?

110
00:05:26,303 --> 00:05:28,351
You never talk about that?

111
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,473
No, never.

112
00:05:30,473 --> 00:05:32,486
We're just living in the moment.

113
00:05:33,264 --> 00:05:35,277
It's nice for once not to get hung up

114
00:05:35,277 --> 00:05:37,290
on, ''Where is this going?''

115
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:38,933
Afraid to ask him?

116
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:40,497
Could not be more terrified.

117
00:05:41,272 --> 00:05:42,335
You should seriously

118
00:05:42,335 --> 00:05:43,398
consider marriage.

119
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:45,891
Give Rachel another chance to dress

120
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:48,274
like Princess Bubble Yum.

121
00:05:51,383 --> 00:05:53,931
I was laughing at this quip

122
00:05:53,931 --> 00:05:56,479
Leno made last night.

123
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:58,489
I wasn't laughing at your dress.

124
00:05:58,489 --> 00:06:00,457
I love you.

125
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,356
Where's Benny?

126
00:06:06,431 --> 00:06:08,331
There he is!

127
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:09,458
Where's Benny?

128
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:11,429
There he is!

129
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:16,836
Babies probably learn to talk

130
00:06:16,836 --> 00:06:19,333
so they can tell grownups to cut it out.

131
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:23,339
Hey, I got a question for you.

132
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:24,962
Just a little thing, no pressure.

133
00:06:24,962 --> 00:06:26,543
Okay.

134
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:32,245
Do you ever think about the future?

135
00:06:32,457 --> 00:06:33,970
Sure, I do.

136
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,483
Yeah? Am I in it?

137
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:39,385
Honey you are it.

138
00:06:40,465 --> 00:06:41,978
Oh, God.

139
00:06:41,978 --> 00:06:43,491
You're about to get so lucky.

140
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:44,866
Yeah?

141
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:45,463
Yeah.

142
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:50,371
Keep talking.

143
00:06:50,371 --> 00:06:51,468
Well....

144
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:52,993
Sometimes I think about

145
00:06:52,993 --> 00:06:54,477
selling my practice.

146
00:06:55,513 --> 00:06:58,482
We could move to France.

147
00:06:59,284 --> 00:07:00,410
Make French toast.

148
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:08,517
Okay, so we're in France...and we're making the toast.

149
00:07:10,261 --> 00:07:11,842
Do you see a little bassinet

150
00:07:11,842 --> 00:07:13,423
in the corner?

151
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:15,365
Like a hound?

152
00:07:17,368 --> 00:07:19,268
Not a basset.

153
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:21,234
A bassinet.

154
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:25,368
You really need the bassinet?

155
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:27,507
Well, I just think the baby

156
00:07:27,507 --> 00:07:29,537
would keep falling off the dog.

157
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:35,283
Do you not see kids in our future?

158
00:07:36,454 --> 00:07:38,285
I love children.

159
00:07:38,456 --> 00:07:40,287
I have children.

160
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:42,375
I don't wanna be 70

161
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:46,490
when our kids go to college and our life can finally start.

162
00:07:51,302 --> 00:07:54,362
I want you now.

163
00:07:55,473 --> 00:07:57,304
Well, that's great.

164
00:07:57,475 --> 00:08:00,239
We don't need to talk about this now.

165
00:08:00,311 --> 00:08:01,858
This is so, like,

166
00:08:01,858 --> 00:08:03,405
way, way in the future.

167
00:08:04,215 --> 00:08:05,813
I'm talking hovercrafts

168
00:08:05,813 --> 00:08:07,411
and apes taking over the planet.

169
00:08:12,223 --> 00:08:13,719
Come on, Chandler.

170
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:15,215
I want this part so much.

171
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,893
Just one kiss.

172
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:18,326
I won't tell anyone.

173
00:08:18,429 --> 00:08:21,227
Joey, no means no.

174
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:24,332
Hey.

175
00:08:26,237 --> 00:08:27,750
I'm sorry,

176
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,263
we don't have your sheep.

177
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:34,438
I think you look cute.

178
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,864
Thank you.

179
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:38,348
And you. You....

180
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:41,318
You, I could eat.

181
00:08:41,318 --> 00:08:43,252
Get away from me. I said no.

182
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,255
Richard's downstairs.

183
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:48,922
Richard's here?

184
00:08:48,922 --> 00:08:50,486
I should run down and say goodbye.

185
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:55,294
Bye.

186
00:08:55,294 --> 00:08:56,289
Good luck.

187
00:08:58,369 --> 00:08:59,916
How's your date with cyber-chick?

188
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,463
Hey, what is all that?

189
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:03,774
It's a website.

190
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:05,241
It's the Guggenheim Museum.

191
00:09:05,343 --> 00:09:10,338
See, she likes art and I like funny words.

192
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:14,316
What does she mean by ''HH''?

193
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:17,320
It means we're holding hands.

194
00:09:18,423 --> 00:09:20,220
Are you the cutest?

195
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:22,316
I'm afraid I might just be.

196
00:09:25,229 --> 00:09:26,793
I think it's so great

197
00:09:26,793 --> 00:09:30,930
that you're into this person yet for all you know, she could be

198
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,427
90 years old or have two heads.

199
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:36,330
It could be a guy.

200
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:38,771
It's not a guy, all right?

201
00:09:38,771 --> 00:09:40,267
I know her.

202
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:43,280
It could be like a big, giant guy.

203
00:09:45,383 --> 00:09:47,817
Man, I got this close to him,

204
00:09:47,817 --> 00:09:50,251
and Monica kneed me in the back.

205
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:52,250
What's going on?

206
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,786
We're wondering

207
00:09:53,786 --> 00:09:55,282
if his girlfriend's a girl.

208
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,311
Ask how long she's gonna live.

209
00:09:57,311 --> 00:09:59,262
Women live longer than men.

210
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:06,361
How do you not fall down more?

211
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:08,852
Okay. Ask her what is her method

212
00:10:08,852 --> 00:10:10,399
of birth control.

213
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:12,375
All right.

214
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,397
''My husband is sleeping

215
00:10:17,397 --> 00:10:19,314
with his secretary.''

216
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:21,385
She's married?

217
00:10:22,286 --> 00:10:24,277
At least we know she's a woman.

218
00:10:26,391 --> 00:10:28,404
I can't believe she's married.

219
00:10:28,404 --> 00:10:30,417
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

220
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,297
This must be really tough for you.

221
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:40,970
I read this article that says

222
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,404
you shouldn't throw rice at weddings.

223
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:46,410
When pigeons eat rice, it kills them.

224
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:48,378
So that's why you never see

225
00:10:48,378 --> 00:10:50,312
pigeons in sushi bars.

226
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:52,912
See, we're having fun.

227
00:10:52,912 --> 00:10:54,408
Oh, absolutely.

228
00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:56,486
I'm not thinking about that thing

229
00:10:56,486 --> 00:10:58,420
we won't think about.

230
00:10:58,523 --> 00:11:00,354
Neither am I.

231
00:11:00,491 --> 00:11:01,873
Hey, there.

232
00:11:01,873 --> 00:11:03,255
Are you all right?

233
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:05,312
Yeah. But I saw the window

234
00:11:05,312 --> 00:11:07,263
I crawled out of at my wedding.

235
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:09,294
And I just started thinking

236
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:11,290
I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't.

237
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:13,417
People will look at me and judge me

238
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:15,465
and think about the last time.

239
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:17,990
It's gonna be okay. It's a wedding.

240
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,407
People focus on the bride.

241
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:22,471
I know, you're right.

242
00:11:22,513 --> 00:11:23,912
Alrighty.

243
00:11:23,912 --> 00:11:25,311
Everybody look at me. Good.

244
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:29,332
It's time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines.

245
00:11:29,332 --> 00:11:30,378
Thank you.

246
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:33,390
I'll see you after the thing.

247
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:34,389
Good luck.

248
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:35,287
Thank you.

249
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:35,905
Okay.

250
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:36,417
Okay.

251
00:11:36,494 --> 00:11:38,394
Okay.

252
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:51,825
Why didn't you tell me?

253
00:11:51,825 --> 00:11:53,309
What could I do?

254
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:56,363
Shout, ''Hey, your butt is showing!''

255
00:11:56,363 --> 00:11:59,315
Yeah! Better you than Barry's uncle!

256
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,282
This is so humiliating.

257
00:12:01,352 --> 00:12:02,819
The only thing worse

258
00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:06,351
was in eighth grade when I had to sing the ''Copacabana''

259
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,347
to the entire school.

260
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,859
Two lines into it, I freaked out.

261
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:13,259
My life's flashing before my eyes.

262
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:14,860
Rach, look, I remember that.

263
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,356
It wasn't so bad.

264
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,430
Ross, would you stop!

265
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,460
You got me. I'm dating you.

266
00:12:21,272 --> 00:12:22,836
Rachel.

267
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:24,400
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Weinberg.

268
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:25,925
It's wonderful

269
00:12:25,925 --> 00:12:27,375
to see you again, my dear.

270
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:28,992
In fact, I hardly expected

271
00:12:28,992 --> 00:12:30,573
to see so much.

272
00:12:32,483 --> 00:12:34,883
You told me you didn't see anything.

273
00:12:34,883 --> 00:12:37,283
I tell you a lot of things.

274
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:38,952
It's wonderful to have you

275
00:12:38,952 --> 00:12:40,516
up and about again, dear.

276
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:43,290
Stay well.

277
00:12:44,295 --> 00:12:46,394
That's the third time someone has

278
00:12:46,394 --> 00:12:48,493
said something like that to me today.

279
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,424
Rach!

280
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:51,951
Oh, my God, I'm married!

281
00:12:51,951 --> 00:12:53,401
I know!

282
00:12:53,504 --> 00:12:57,304
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter-Farber.

283
00:12:57,408 --> 00:12:59,342
I am so proud of you, Min.

284
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:01,343
Min.

285
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:03,244
Rach. Still here.

286
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:05,298
At our wedding, they'd packed up

287
00:13:05,298 --> 00:13:07,249
the chopped liver by now.

288
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:09,444
Oh, yeah, I love that story.

289
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:11,480
I have a question.

290
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,871
Why are people saying

291
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:15,452
it's good to see me up and about?

292
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,975
After you ran out on your wedding Barry's parents told people

293
00:13:19,975 --> 00:13:23,290
you were sort of insane.

294
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:25,269
Insane?

295
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:27,266
From the syphilis.

296
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:28,463
What?

297
00:13:29,507 --> 00:13:31,486
What were they gonna say?

298
00:13:31,486 --> 00:13:33,465
You didn't love me anymore?

299
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:38,271
Your choices were that or syphilis?

300
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:40,481
Sweetie, at least this puts your whole

301
00:13:40,481 --> 00:13:42,580
tushy show into perspective.

302
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:45,580
Angela?

303
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:47,382
Joey Tribbiani.

304
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:51,386
Listen, what are you doing tonight?

305
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:53,463
I know you're seeing that guy.

306
00:13:53,463 --> 00:13:55,431
Maybe you could bring him....

307
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:57,524
Hello? Hello?

308
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,275
Will you answer? That's the 10th

309
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:12,271
bing-bong message she's sent.

310
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,914
She asks what's wrong.

311
00:14:13,914 --> 00:14:15,478
What's wrong? You're married!

312
00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:18,245
That's what's wrong!

313
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:20,469
Oh, my.

314
00:14:20,469 --> 00:14:21,481
What?

315
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,454
She wants to meet you.

316
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:24,944
Look, Phoebe,

317
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:26,394
I wanted to meet her too.

318
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:27,863
But she's married.

319
00:14:27,863 --> 00:14:29,262
She has a husband.

320
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:30,914
What if he's the wrong guy

321
00:14:30,914 --> 00:14:32,461
and you are the right guy?

322
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:35,464
You don't get these chances often.

323
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:37,406
Meet her or you'll kick yourself

324
00:14:37,406 --> 00:14:40,873
when you're 80 which is hard to do

325
00:14:40,873 --> 00:14:42,369
and you'll break a hip.

326
00:14:45,283 --> 00:14:46,307
I don't know.

327
00:14:46,484 --> 00:14:48,452
Listen. Those are the bing-bongs

328
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:50,420
of a woman in love with you.

329
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,490
Okay. I'll do it.

330
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:57,392
Okay, great! Put on your shoes

331
00:14:57,392 --> 00:14:59,491
and then march out there and meet her.

332
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,997
No, wait! You have

333
00:15:00,997 --> 00:15:02,464
to take a shower because:

334
00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:04,326
And I'll get the--

335
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:05,931
No, you have to answer her.

336
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:07,427
Answer her first.

337
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:09,354
No, make some coffee

338
00:15:09,354 --> 00:15:11,237
because it's too much.

339
00:15:15,346 --> 00:15:16,859
Okay, one more, please.

340
00:15:16,859 --> 00:15:18,372
I'll get it in this time.

341
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:20,382
Okay, last chance.

342
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:28,257
Again, I'm sorry.

343
00:15:32,363 --> 00:15:33,927
You know what?

344
00:15:33,927 --> 00:15:35,491
Maybe I don't need to have children.

345
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:37,865
Maybe I just think I do

346
00:15:37,865 --> 00:15:45,467
because that's what society and by that, I mean my mom...has always convinced me that I--

347
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:51,305
I do.

348
00:15:51,382 --> 00:15:52,878
I have to have children.

349
00:15:52,878 --> 00:15:54,374
I'm sorry, I just do.

350
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:59,312
Can I have your attention?

351
00:15:59,423 --> 00:16:01,414
Best man making a toast here.

352
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:03,324
Thank you.

353
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:06,376
I remember when Barry got home

354
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:08,424
from his first date with Rachel.

355
00:16:11,235 --> 00:16:13,283
What? You hired the same band.

356
00:16:13,283 --> 00:16:15,331
I can't use the same speech?

357
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:16,889
Thank you.

358
00:16:16,889 --> 00:16:18,339
Thank you very much.

359
00:16:18,376 --> 00:16:22,469
Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together.

360
00:16:23,347 --> 00:16:24,336
And Rachel....

361
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:26,346
What?

362
00:16:26,346 --> 00:16:27,443
No, no, in all seriousness.

363
00:16:28,252 --> 00:16:29,748
Not many women would

364
00:16:29,748 --> 00:16:31,244
have the guts to be here.

365
00:16:31,288 --> 00:16:33,284
And even fewer who'd do it

366
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,280
with their asses hanging out.

367
00:16:42,266 --> 00:16:44,393
I'd like to add something to that.

368
00:16:44,468 --> 00:16:45,884
Why are you adding?

369
00:16:45,884 --> 00:16:47,300
It's okay.

370
00:16:48,372 --> 00:16:49,936
Most of you don't know me.

371
00:16:49,936 --> 00:16:51,500
I'm Rachel's boyfriend.

372
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:53,469
Oh, dear God.

373
00:16:54,378 --> 00:16:55,470
Ross.

374
00:16:55,579 --> 00:17:00,398
And I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage

375
00:17:00,398 --> 00:17:02,514
for Rachel to come here tonight.

376
00:17:03,254 --> 00:17:07,790
And just for the record she did not run out on Barry

377
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,224
because she had syphilis.

378
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:13,224
I'm serious.

379
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:17,800
The reason she walked out

380
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,305
on Barry is simply that she didn't love him.

381
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:24,324
Which, incidentally,

382
00:17:24,324 --> 00:17:26,275
worked out pretty well for me.

383
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:34,451
So, to review:

384
00:17:37,354 --> 00:17:49,255
Rachel took a lot of courage doesn't have the syphilis and wound up with me.

385
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,296
Cheers.

386
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:53,882
See you in the parking lot.

387
00:17:53,882 --> 00:17:55,395
No, Rach--

388
00:17:57,475 --> 00:17:59,858
And once again, she is out of here!

389
00:17:59,858 --> 00:18:02,241
Okay, who had 9:45?

390
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:17,777
You know what, Bar?

391
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:19,227
I'm not gonna leave.

392
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,331
I probably should, but I'm not.

393
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:25,334
I promised myself I'd make it

394
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:28,235
through at least one of your weddings.

395
00:18:31,342 --> 00:18:33,293
All I wanted was

396
00:18:33,293 --> 00:18:37,342
to make it through this evening with a little bit of grace

397
00:18:37,342 --> 00:18:39,338
and dignity.

398
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,518
Well, I guess we can all agree

399
00:18:41,518 --> 00:18:43,486
that's not gonna happen.

400
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:48,854
I guess there's nothing

401
00:18:48,854 --> 00:18:52,456
really left to say except:

402
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:18,310
Thank you, honey.

403
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,427
Wait, wait! Everybody!

404
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:28,524
Everybody!

405
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:54,481
Okay. I'll do it.

406
00:19:55,392 --> 00:19:56,359
You'll do what?

407
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,411
If it takes kids to be with you,

408
00:19:58,411 --> 00:20:00,362
then kids it is.

409
00:20:00,464 --> 00:20:01,488
Oh, my God.

410
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:04,817
If I have to, I'll do it all again.

411
00:20:04,817 --> 00:20:07,268
I'll do the 4:00 feeding thing.

412
00:20:07,371 --> 00:20:09,367
I'll go to the PTA meetings.

413
00:20:09,367 --> 00:20:11,363
I'll coach the soccer team.

414
00:20:12,376 --> 00:20:13,422
Really?

415
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:14,468
Yeah, if I have to.

416
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:22,280
Monica...I don't wanna lose you.

417
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:27,387
So if I have to do it all again then I will.

418
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:33,295
You are the most wonderful man.

419
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:43,455
And if you hadn't said ''If I have to,'' like, 1 7 times...then I'd be saying,

420
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:44,604
''Okay, let's do it.''

421
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,307
But you're not.

422
00:20:50,514 --> 00:20:52,965
Oh, my God. I can't believe

423
00:20:52,965 --> 00:20:55,416
what I'm getting ready to say.

424
00:20:59,456 --> 00:21:01,447
I wanna have a baby.

425
00:21:04,495 --> 00:21:06,975
But I don't want to have one with

426
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:09,455
someone who doesn't really want one.

427
00:21:11,468 --> 00:21:13,299
God....

428
00:21:18,475 --> 00:21:20,306
I love you.

429
00:21:25,282 --> 00:21:26,510
I know you do.

430
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,285
Me too.

431
00:21:38,295 --> 00:21:39,523
So what now?

432
00:21:41,532 --> 00:21:46,401
I guess we just keep dancing.

433
00:22:01,285 --> 00:22:01,882
Where is she?

434
00:22:01,882 --> 00:22:02,479
Where is she?

435
00:22:03,253 --> 00:22:04,749
Oh, hey, I have a question.

436
00:22:04,749 --> 00:22:06,245
Where is she?

437
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,820
Relax, Chandler.

438
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,350
She'll be here.

439
00:22:12,363 --> 00:22:13,352
Oh, that's her.

440
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:17,263
Yeah, because life's just that kind.

441
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:19,469
Stop staring at the door.

442
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,401
It's like a watched pot.

443
00:22:21,472 --> 00:22:23,468
If you keep looking at it,

444
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:25,464
the door's never gonna boil.

445
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:27,005
I think what you have to do

446
00:22:27,005 --> 00:22:28,501
is try not to--

447
00:22:34,418 --> 00:22:36,318
Oh, my God.

448
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:44,290
Oh my God.

449
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:57,301
Oh my God.

450
00:23:05,449 --> 00:23:06,438
All right.

451
00:23:07,351 --> 00:23:08,864
I've felt guilty because

452
00:23:08,864 --> 00:23:10,377
I wanna be a good friend.

453
00:23:10,454 --> 00:23:12,502
And damn it, I am a good friend.

454
00:23:12,502 --> 00:23:14,550
So shut up and close your eyes.

455
00:23:18,295 --> 00:23:19,455
Wow.

456
00:23:20,497 --> 00:23:22,488
You are a good friend.

457
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:24,831
Of course, the audition's over,

458
00:23:24,831 --> 00:23:26,395
and I didn't get it.

459
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:29,496
But that was a hell of a kiss.

460
00:23:30,274 --> 00:23:32,504
Rachel is a very lucky girl.
