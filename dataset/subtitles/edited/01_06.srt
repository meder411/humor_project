1
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:08,332
Oh, look! There's Joey's picture!

2
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,467
This is so exciting!

3
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:11,739
You can spot someone who's

4
00:00:11,739 --> 00:00:13,235
never seen his plays.

5
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:14,893
Notice, no fear.

6
00:00:14,893 --> 00:00:16,440
No sense of impending doom.

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,947
''The role of man number three

8
00:00:19,947 --> 00:00:22,444
will not be played by Vic Shapiro.''

9
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,287
We came on the wrong night.

10
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:29,257
I can't believe I forgot a magazine.

11
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:30,791
Come on, this might be good.

12
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,287
I don't know.

13
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:34,833
The exclamation point scares me.

14
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,301
It's not just Freud, it's Freud!

15
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,373
Magic is about to happen!

16
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:44,972
Well, Eva we've done

17
00:00:44,972 --> 00:00:46,468
some excellent work here.

18
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:54,285
And I would have to say your problem is quite clear.

19
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:59,288
All you want is a dinkle

20
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:02,327
What you envy's a schwang

21
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:05,525
A thing through which you can tinkle

22
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,427
To play with or simply let hang

23
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,344
I feel violated.

24
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:27,809
Did anybody else feel like

25
00:02:27,809 --> 00:02:32,247
peeling their skin off to have something else to do?

26
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,341
Ross, 10:00.

27
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,286
Is it? It feels like 2.

28
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,373
No, 10:00!

29
00:02:38,373 --> 00:02:40,290
What?

30
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,408
There's a beautiful woman

31
00:02:42,408 --> 00:02:44,456
at 8, 9, 10:00!

32
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,458
Hello!

33
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,452
She's amazing! She makes the women I

34
00:02:50,452 --> 00:02:53,404
dream about look like fat, bald men.

35
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,468
Go over.

36
00:02:54,468 --> 00:02:55,463
She's not with anyone.

37
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,408
And what would my opening line be?

38
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,308
Excuse me....

39
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,846
Come on, she's a person.

40
00:03:02,846 --> 00:03:04,245
You can do it.

41
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,834
Could she be more out of my league?

42
00:03:05,834 --> 00:03:07,318
Back me up.

43
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,320
He couldn't get a woman

44
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,220
like that in a million years.

45
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:14,376
You always see these beautiful

46
00:03:14,376 --> 00:03:16,327
women with ''nothing'' guys.

47
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:19,262
You could be one of those guys.

48
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,360
You could do that.

49
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,355
You think?

50
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,231
Absolutely!

51
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,348
I can't believe

52
00:03:24,348 --> 00:03:25,360
I'm considering this.

53
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:26,904
I'm very aware of my tongue.

54
00:03:26,904 --> 00:03:28,337
Come on.

55
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,341
Here goes.

56
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:31,939
Stand back, everyone.

57
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:33,435
Incoming ego shrapnel.

58
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,340
All right, I can do this.

59
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:41,299
Yes?

60
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:42,345
Hi.

61
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:47,259
Okay, next word would be Chandler.

62
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,556
Chandler is my name and....

63
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,297
Hi!

64
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,265
Yes, you said that.

65
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:57,798
Yes! Yes, I did.

66
00:03:57,798 --> 00:03:59,294
But what I didn't say....

67
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:03,358
What I wanted to say was would you like to go out with me?

68
00:04:03,358 --> 00:04:05,309
Thank you. Good night.

69
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,435
Chandler?

70
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:11,863
I didn't know you could dance!

71
00:04:11,863 --> 00:04:13,410
You were in a play!

72
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,421
What'd you think?

73
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,786
I didn't know you could dance!

74
00:04:17,786 --> 00:04:19,316
You were in a play!

75
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,841
It wasn't that bad.

76
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:22,257
I was the lead.

77
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:24,376
It was better than the troll thing.

78
00:04:24,376 --> 00:04:26,424
At least you got to see my head.

79
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,848
You're right.

80
00:04:27,848 --> 00:04:29,230
We saw your head.

81
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,369
How about that accent?

82
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:36,374
Yeah. All of your W's were V's.

83
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,336
She said yes!

84
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,439
Awful play, man!

85
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,299
Her name's Aurora. She's Italian

86
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:49,347
and she pronounces my name ''Chandler.''

87
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,449
I like that better.

88
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,458
The usher gave me this.

89
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:56,757
What is it?

90
00:04:56,757 --> 00:04:58,253
The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency.

91
00:04:58,364 --> 00:04:59,780
An agency left its card.

92
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,196
They wanna sign me!

93
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,394
Based on this play?

94
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,496
Based on this play!

95
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,299
Look! There's a note on the back.

96
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:13,210
''Loved your work. Call me a sap.''

97
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,307
She was obviously very moved!

98
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,250
You should call her fairly quickly.

99
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,447
Yeah! As soon as possible!

100
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,419
Come in!

101
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,328
Hi. I'm here to see Estelle Leonard.

102
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:32,945
Just a moment, let me see

103
00:05:32,945 --> 00:05:34,526
if she's in.

104
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,435
Hello.

105
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,306
You're Estelle?

106
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:43,406
I know you weren't expecting someone

107
00:05:43,406 --> 00:05:45,471
so fantastically beautiful.

108
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,778
Love lump. Take a load off already,

109
00:05:50,778 --> 00:05:53,275
darling. Sit already.

110
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,949
I can't tell you how excited

111
00:05:54,949 --> 00:05:56,445
I am to be here.

112
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,484
Why not?

113
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,256
What I meant was--

114
00:06:02,256 --> 00:06:04,286
You don't mind if I eat, do you?

115
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:11,916
Joey sweetheart, let me ask you

116
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:13,429
a question.

117
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,821
Did you ever see the movie

118
00:06:15,821 --> 00:06:17,402
Sleepless in Seattle?

119
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,758
Wow! Do you represent those actors?

120
00:06:19,758 --> 00:06:21,305
No.

121
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,347
But you know the end,

122
00:06:23,347 --> 00:06:25,247
where they're happy?

123
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:28,219
That's gonna be you and me.

124
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,450
You mean you wanna sign me?

125
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,772
No, I wanna go to the top of the

126
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:36,320
Empire State Building and make out.

127
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,321
Of course I wanna sign you!

128
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,312
Miss Leonard, I'm so--

129
00:06:41,312 --> 00:06:42,358
Oh, boy.

130
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:43,902
Ride them, cowboy.

131
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:45,369
I'm sorry!

132
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,474
I don't see it!

133
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:01,799
Try to look through it.

134
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:03,312
Unfocus your eyes.

135
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,290
Focus? There's nothing to focus on.

136
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:08,757
It's the Statue of Liberty!

137
00:07:08,757 --> 00:07:10,321
Right!

138
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:11,863
Where's the Statue of Liberty?

139
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:13,330
There.

140
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,333
I can't not see it now.

141
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,325
Hey, kids!

142
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,236
Come here. Do you see anything here?

143
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:22,854
It looks like a boat.

144
00:07:22,854 --> 00:07:24,401
A boat.

145
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,326
Right in front of

146
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:27,441
the Statue of Liberty.

147
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:31,832
It's been seven seconds, and you

148
00:07:31,832 --> 00:07:34,249
haven't asked me how my date went.

149
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,413
How was your date, Chandler?

150
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,253
It was unbelievable!

151
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,275
I've never met anyone like her.

152
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:42,226
She's had an amazing life!

153
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,229
She was in the Israeli army.

154
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,378
None of the bullets hit the engine,

155
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:48,426
so we made it to the border.

156
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,362
But just barely, and I....

157
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,467
I've been talking about myself

158
00:07:53,467 --> 00:07:55,463
all night long. I'm sorry.

159
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,267
What about you? Tell me a story.

160
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:03,214
All right, once I got on the subway.

161
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:06,797
And it was at night and I rode it all the way

162
00:08:06,797 --> 00:08:08,310
to Brooklyn.

163
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:11,185
Just for the hell of it.

164
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,225
We talked until 2:00. It was perfect.

165
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,217
More or less.

166
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,375
Suddenly, we realized we were

167
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:18,421
in Yemen.

168
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,424
I'm sorry, so ''we'' is...?

169
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,197
''We'' is me and Rick.

170
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,225
Who's Rick?

171
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,395
Who's Rick?

172
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:27,501
My husband.

173
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:31,922
Oh, so you're divorced?

174
00:08:31,922 --> 00:08:33,435
No.

175
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,226
I'm sorry. So you're widowed?

176
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:38,239
Hopefully?

177
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,444
No, I'm still married.

178
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,788
So, how would your husband feel

179
00:08:43,788 --> 00:08:48,873
about you sitting here with me sliding your foot so far up my leg

180
00:08:48,873 --> 00:08:51,421
you can count the change in my pocket?

181
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,262
Don't worry.

182
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,284
He'd be okay with you

183
00:08:56,284 --> 00:08:58,235
because he's okay with Ethan.

184
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,263
Ethan? There's an Ethan?

185
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,402
Ethan is my boyfriend.

186
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,270
What?

187
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,829
What kind of relationship

188
00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:13,952
do you imagine us having if you have a husband

189
00:09:13,952 --> 00:09:15,419
and a boyfriend?

190
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:19,214
I suppose, mainly sexual.

191
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,388
Sorry it didn't work out.

192
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,743
What, not work out?

193
00:09:25,743 --> 00:09:27,290
I'm seeing her again on Thursday.

194
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,200
Didn't you listen to the story?

195
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,431
Didn't you listen? It's twisted!

196
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:35,218
How could you get involved

197
00:09:35,218 --> 00:09:36,230
with her?

198
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,321
I had trouble with it at first.

199
00:09:38,321 --> 00:09:40,300
But I get the good stuff.

200
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,880
All the fun, all the talking,

201
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,351
all the sex and none of the responsibility.

202
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,732
This is every guy's fantasy!

203
00:09:48,732 --> 00:09:50,245
That's not true!

204
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,274
Ross, is this your fantasy?

205
00:09:52,274 --> 00:09:54,225
No, of course not.

206
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,429
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

207
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,298
You'd go out with someone

208
00:10:00,298 --> 00:10:02,232
going out with someone else?

209
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:03,363
I couldn't.

210
00:10:03,363 --> 00:10:04,358
Good for you.

211
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,903
When I'm with a woman,

212
00:10:05,903 --> 00:10:08,869
I need to know I'm going out

213
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:10,365
with more people than her.

214
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,790
Once, I went out with a guy who

215
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,337
just got divorced.

216
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,994
It was hard. His kids liked me

217
00:10:15,994 --> 00:10:17,541
better than him.

218
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,381
What does this have to do

219
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:20,478
with Chandler?

220
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,388
Nothing.

221
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:24,939
I didn't have anything

222
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:26,389
on that topic.

223
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,484
So I went another way.

224
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:31,474
You know, monogamy can be

225
00:10:31,474 --> 00:10:33,453
a tricky concept.

226
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,496
I mean, anthropologically speaking--

227
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,362
Fine. Now you'll never know.

228
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,304
We're kidding. Tell us.

229
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:43,340
We wanna know.

230
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,272
Come on!

231
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,328
All right. There's a theory

232
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:48,279
put forth by Richard Leakey--

233
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,821
Are we greeting each other

234
00:11:00,821 --> 00:11:02,317
this way now? I like it.

235
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,424
Look! I cleaned!

236
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:06,863
I did the windows.

237
00:11:06,863 --> 00:11:08,262
I did the floors.

238
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,831
I used all the vacuum attachments but

239
00:11:10,831 --> 00:11:13,328
the round one. What's it for?

240
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:14,935
Nobody knows.

241
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:16,431
And we're not supposed to ask.

242
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,232
What do you think?

243
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,891
It's very clean.

244
00:11:19,891 --> 00:11:21,438
Really, it looks great!

245
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,284
I see you moved the green ottoman.

246
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,384
How did that happen?

247
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,388
I don't know. It looked better there.

248
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,831
And it's an extra seat

249
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:41,298
around the table.

250
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,367
Yeah, it's interesting.

251
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:49,390
But you know what? Just for fun let's see what it looked like

252
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,307
in the old spot.

253
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,472
Just to compare.

254
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,308
Let's see.

255
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,415
Well, it looks good there too.

256
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,245
Let's leave it there for a while.

257
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,767
I can't believe you moved

258
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:04,314
the green ottoman.

259
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,289
Be glad you didn't fan the magazines.

260
00:12:07,289 --> 00:12:09,354
She'll scratch your eyes out.

261
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,941
You guys, I am not that bad!

262
00:12:10,941 --> 00:12:12,454
Yeah, you are.

263
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,897
Remember, I lived with you?

264
00:12:15,897 --> 00:12:17,461
You were a little....

265
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,333
That is so unfair!

266
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,872
When we were kids, yours was the only

267
00:12:25,872 --> 00:12:28,369
Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy.

268
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,346
Okay, so I'm responsible.

269
00:12:31,346 --> 00:12:32,443
I'm organized.

270
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,476
But hey, I can be a kook!

271
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,280
All right, you madcap gal!

272
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,249
Imagine this.

273
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,329
The phone bill arrives,

274
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:46,297
but you don't pay it right away.

275
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:47,831
Why not?

276
00:12:47,831 --> 00:12:49,264
Because you're a kook!

277
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,498
You wait until they send a notice.

278
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,270
I could do that.

279
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:58,276
Okay, then you let me

280
00:12:58,276 --> 00:13:00,244
go grocery shopping--

281
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,876
No problem.

282
00:13:01,876 --> 00:13:03,406
I'm not done yet.

283
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,747
And I buy detergent, but it's not

284
00:13:06,747 --> 00:13:09,244
the one with the easy-pour spout.

285
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,516
Why would someone do that?

286
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,352
One might wonder.

287
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,422
But I would be fine with that.

288
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,916
A glass is on the table with no

289
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:24,367
coaster. A cold drink. A hot day.

290
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:27,350
Beads of condensation are inching

291
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,363
closer to the wood....

292
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,464
Stop it!

293
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,470
Oh, my God!

294
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,282
It's true. Who am I?

295
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,452
Monica, you're Mom.

296
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,284
Oh, my God!

297
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,466
Okay, I'll be there.

298
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,395
That was my agent.

299
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,319
My agent has just gotten me a job

300
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:06,299
in the new AI Pacino movie!

301
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,862
That's great!

302
00:14:07,862 --> 00:14:09,312
What's the part?

303
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,411
Can you believe it? Pacino!

304
00:14:11,411 --> 00:14:13,407
This guy's why I became an actor!

305
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,819
''Out of order? You're out of order!

306
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:19,418
This whole courtroom's out of order!''

307
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,226
Seriously, what's the part?

308
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:24,279
''Just when I thought I was out,

309
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:26,230
they pull me back in!''

310
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,828
Come on. Seriously, Joey,

311
00:14:27,828 --> 00:14:29,324
what's the part?

312
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,463
You're.... What?

313
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,434
I'm his butt double, okay?

314
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,475
I play AI Pacino's butt.

315
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:48,800
All right? He goes into the shower,

316
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,447
and then I'm his butt.

317
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,283
Oh, my God!

318
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,451
Come on, you guys.

319
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,394
It's a real Pacino movie

320
00:14:57,394 --> 00:14:59,294
and that's big!

321
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,198
It's terrific. You deserve this.

322
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,714
After years of struggling you've

323
00:15:04,714 --> 00:15:07,194
cracked your way into show business.

324
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,239
Fine. Make jokes, I don't care.

325
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,875
This is a big break for me!

326
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,439
You're right. It is.

327
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:18,712
So, will you invite us

328
00:15:18,712 --> 00:15:20,208
to the big opening?

329
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:30,945
I need some moisturizer.

330
00:15:30,945 --> 00:15:32,429
For what?

331
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,223
Today's the big day!

332
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,949
You got any tweezers? I think

333
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:40,462
I have a rogue hair.

334
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,907
God. Go in the bathroom.

335
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:44,374
Use whatever you want.

336
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,910
Don't ever tell me what you did

337
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,377
in there.

338
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,346
Thank you.

339
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,767
Joey's mom's on the phone.

340
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:54,251
In the bathroom.

341
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,867
You don't wanna go in there!

342
00:15:55,867 --> 00:15:57,448
Come on, we're roommates.

343
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,317
My eyes! My eyes!

344
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,389
I warned you.

345
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,392
Who is being loud?

346
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,401
Oh, that would be Monica.

347
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,815
Can I borrow stuff?

348
00:16:11,815 --> 00:16:13,328
I wanna make Aurora breakfast.

349
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,339
You got the whole night?

350
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,925
Well, I only have 20 minutes

351
00:16:16,925 --> 00:16:18,409
until Ethan, so....

352
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,439
Do I sense resentment?

353
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:26,341
No. No resentment. Believe me it's worth it, okay?

354
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,903
In a relationship, you have moments

355
00:16:28,903 --> 00:16:31,354
you'll remember the rest of your life.

356
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,340
Every single second is like that

357
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,223
with Aurora.

358
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,424
I've just wasted 35 of them

359
00:16:36,424 --> 00:16:37,521
talking to you.

360
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:39,793
So, Monica, can you

361
00:16:39,793 --> 00:16:41,323
help me with the door?

362
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:47,333
The old Monica would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with

363
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,329
a plastic brush.

364
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,469
But I'm not gonna do that.

365
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,333
Excuse me? Can they warm it up?

366
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,415
I'm concerned about goose bumps.

367
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,213
Everybody ready?

368
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:07,888
I wanna thank you

369
00:17:07,888 --> 00:17:09,384
for this opportunity.

370
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:12,312
I mean, I know this is just a first

371
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:15,196
step, but I hope that someday--

372
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,256
Lose the robe.

373
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:20,270
Right. Okay. Losing the robe!

374
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,231
Okay, and the robe is lost.

375
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:26,411
I would like to get this in one take.

376
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,242
Let's roll it.

377
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,304
Water's working.

378
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,283
And action!

379
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,218
And cut!

380
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:39,289
Butt guy, what are you doing?

381
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,222
I'm showering.

382
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,351
No, that was clenching.

383
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,380
The way I see it,

384
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,331
the guy's upset here, you know?

385
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,832
His wife's dead,

386
00:17:48,832 --> 00:17:50,231
his brother's missing.

387
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,238
I think his butt would be angry here.

388
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:55,373
I think his butt would like

389
00:17:55,373 --> 00:17:57,307
to get the shot before lunch.

390
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:58,826
Once again, rolling.

391
00:17:58,826 --> 00:18:00,276
Water working.

392
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,248
And action!

393
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,216
And cut! What was that?

394
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,381
I was going for quiet desperation.

395
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,283
But if you have to ask....

396
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,334
God, I love these fingers.

397
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,493
Thank you.

398
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:28,297
No, actually, I meant my fingers.

399
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,936
Look at them.

400
00:18:29,936 --> 00:18:31,432
Look at how happy they are.

401
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,779
Oh, my God, I'm late!

402
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:36,246
Oh, no!

403
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:37,832
Don't go.

404
00:18:37,832 --> 00:18:39,316
Okay.

405
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,331
I have to.

406
00:18:41,331 --> 00:18:42,343
Look, she's leaving.

407
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,416
I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.

408
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,408
I thought you talked to Rick.

409
00:18:47,408 --> 00:18:49,359
It's not Rick.

410
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,259
Ethan? He gets the whole day!

411
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,232
No, it's Andrew.

412
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:03,240
I know there'll be moments when I'll regret asking

413
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,174
the following question, but....

414
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,843
And Andrew is?

415
00:19:06,843 --> 00:19:10,280
He's new.

416
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,849
So you're not completely fulfilled

417
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:15,283
by Rick, Ethan and myself?

418
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,187
No, that's not exactly what I was--

419
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:22,284
Most women would kill for three guys like us.

420
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,908
So, what do you want?

421
00:19:24,908 --> 00:19:26,421
You.

422
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,296
You have me.

423
00:19:28,296 --> 00:19:29,393
No. Just you.

424
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:31,816
What do you mean?

425
00:19:31,816 --> 00:19:33,397
Lose the other guys.

426
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:37,298
Like, all of them?

427
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:38,926
Come on, we're great together.

428
00:19:38,926 --> 00:19:40,410
Why not?

429
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,204
Can't we have what we have now?

430
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:46,934
Why can't we talk and make love without feeling obligated

431
00:19:46,934 --> 00:19:48,418
to each other?

432
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,217
Up until tonight, I thought

433
00:19:51,217 --> 00:19:53,213
that's what you wanted too.

434
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:59,842
Well, part of me wants that but it's like I'm two guys.

435
00:19:59,842 --> 00:20:02,322
One guy's saying, ''This is great!''

436
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,335
But there's this other guy.

437
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,336
The guy who wells up

438
00:20:06,336 --> 00:20:10,433
when the Grinch's heart grows and breaks that measuring device.

439
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,393
He's saying, you know,

440
00:20:13,393 --> 00:20:15,543
''This is too hard. Get out!''

441
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,777
So, which one of the guys

442
00:20:17,777 --> 00:20:19,273
will you listen to?

443
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,749
I have to listen to both.

444
00:20:22,749 --> 00:20:25,246
They don't let each other finish.

445
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,483
Which one?

446
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,489
The second guy.

447
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,266
I see.

448
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:42,263
Call me if you change your mind.

449
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:54,275
Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.

450
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:09,266
Look at it this way. You dumped her!

451
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:12,383
Right? I mean, this woman was

452
00:21:12,383 --> 00:21:16,856
unbelievably sexy and beautiful, intelligent,

453
00:21:16,856 --> 00:21:19,239
unattainable.

454
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,440
Tell me why you did this again?

455
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,280
Movie star!

456
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,865
Wait! Aren't you the guy who plays

457
00:21:28,865 --> 00:21:31,345
the butt in the new Pacino movie?

458
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,349
Nope.

459
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:36,293
No? What happened, big guy?

460
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,363
Big guy?

461
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,456
It felt like a ''big guy'' moment.

462
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,302
I got fired!

463
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:48,464
They said I acted too much with it.

464
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,266
I told everybody about this!

465
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:53,827
Everybody's expecting to see me.

466
00:21:53,827 --> 00:21:55,277
Know what?

467
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,978
No one will be able to tell.

468
00:21:56,978 --> 00:21:58,576
My mom will.

469
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,515
There's something so sweet

470
00:22:02,515 --> 00:22:04,511
and disturbing about that.

471
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,792
I've done crappy plays

472
00:22:07,792 --> 00:22:10,892
for six years and I finally get my shot,

473
00:22:10,892 --> 00:22:12,456
and I blow it!

474
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:14,459
Maybe this wasn't it.

475
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,349
I think when it's your shot,

476
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:19,465
you know it's your shot.

477
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:23,241
Did it feel like your shot?

478
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,437
Hard to tell. I was naked.

479
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:28,474
I don't think this was it.

480
00:22:28,474 --> 00:22:30,470
I don't think you just get one.

481
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,830
I believe things are gonna happen

482
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,377
for you. I do.

483
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:36,449
You've got to think about

484
00:22:36,449 --> 00:22:38,445
the day some kid will go:

485
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,970
''I got the part!

486
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:43,450
I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!''

487
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:48,489
You think? That's so nice.

488
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:55,902
I'm sorry, Joey.

489
00:22:55,902 --> 00:22:57,398
I'm gonna go to bed, guys.

490
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:58,522
Good night.

491
00:22:58,522 --> 00:22:59,568
Good night.

492
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:01,325
You're gonna leave

493
00:23:01,325 --> 00:23:02,405
your shoes out here?

494
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:07,835
Really? Just casually

495
00:23:07,835 --> 00:23:13,323
strewn about in that reckless, haphazard manner?

496
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,892
It doesn't matter.

497
00:23:15,892 --> 00:23:18,326
I'll get them tomorrow. Or not!

498
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,424
Whenever.

499
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:26,429
She is a kook.

500
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,817
If it bothers you that much,

501
00:23:40,817 --> 00:23:43,251
just go out and get the shoes.

502
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,451
No, don't do this!

503
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,356
This is stupid!

504
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:50,344
I don't have to prove anything.

505
00:23:50,344 --> 00:23:52,295
I'm gonna get them.

506
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:55,366
But then everyone will know.

507
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:57,850
Unless I get them, then wake up

508
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:00,233
really early and put them back.

509
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,398
I need help!

510
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,240
-All you want is a dinkle

511
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,236
Not that song!

512
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,311
-All you envy's a schwang

513
00:24:12,311 --> 00:24:14,307
Come on, you guys.

514
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:18,321
A thing through which you can tinkle

515
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:21,348
Or play with or simply let hang

516
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:26,329
All you want is a dinkle

517
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:29,457
What you envy's a schwang

518
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:33,431
A thing through which you can tinkle

519
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:38,341
Or play with or simply let hang
