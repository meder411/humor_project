1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:02,918
This is pretty much

2
00:00:02,918 --> 00:00:04,368
what's happened so far.

3
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:05,987
Ross was in love

4
00:00:05,987 --> 00:00:07,437
with Rachel forever.

5
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,390
When he tried to tell her, things got

6
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,240
in the way. Like cats, Italian guys.

7
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:14,809
Finally, Chandler said,

8
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:16,339
''Forget about her. ''

9
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:18,866
When Ross was in China, Chandler

10
00:00:18,866 --> 00:00:21,283
let it slip that Ross loved Rachel.

11
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,288
She said, ''Oh, my God!''

12
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,823
So she went to the airport

13
00:00:24,823 --> 00:00:26,290
to meet him.

14
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,310
She didn't know Ross

15
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,261
was with another woman.

16
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,491
That's everything you need to know.

17
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:35,313
Enough about us.

18
00:00:35,313 --> 00:00:36,359
How've you been?

19
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:23,812
Flight number 257

20
00:01:23,812 --> 00:01:25,342
from Beijing now arriving.

21
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,447
Oh, my God.

22
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,451
Oh, my God.

23
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:35,556
Excuse me.

24
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:37,376
Move, move, move!

25
00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:38,456
Emergency, please!

26
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,357
Excuse me.

27
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:50,467
There you are.

28
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:56,277
So, so....

29
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:57,832
How was China?

30
00:01:57,832 --> 00:01:59,282
You!

31
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,454
It was great. What happened?

32
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:03,836
You're bleeding.

33
00:02:03,836 --> 00:02:04,416
I am?

34
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,425
Oh, look at that! Yes, I am.

35
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,892
Enough of me,

36
00:02:07,892 --> 00:02:09,325
Mr. Back-from-the-Orient.

37
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,363
Come on, I wanna hear everything!

38
00:02:11,363 --> 00:02:13,331
Everything!

39
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,334
Well, where do I start?

40
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:18,904
This is Julie.

41
00:02:18,904 --> 00:02:20,371
Julie, this is Rachel.

42
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:26,457
These are....

43
00:02:26,457 --> 00:02:29,340
These are aren't for you.

45
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,343
These are for you.

46
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,386
Welcome to our country.

47
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:40,483
Thank you. I'm from New York!

48
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,878
No problem. We'll use them

49
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,261
to stop the bleeding.

50
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,418
Baggage claim?

51
00:02:50,418 --> 00:02:51,567
Okay.

52
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,427
She went to the airport.

53
00:02:59,427 --> 00:03:01,344
She's going for it with Ross.

54
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:05,316
Oh, my God! This is huge!

55
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,214
This is bigger than huge.

56
00:03:07,214 --> 00:03:08,209
This is....

57
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,313
All right, what's bigger than huge?

58
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:12,891
This?

59
00:03:12,891 --> 00:03:13,357
Yes.

60
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,421
You got new haircuts.

61
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:17,958
Yes, we did.

62
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,454
Thanks to Vidal Buffay.

63
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,832
Because, ''If you don't look good,

64
00:03:22,832 --> 00:03:24,430
we don't look good.''

65
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,461
I love that voice.

66
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:32,240
Here. And the winner is Ava Gardner.

67
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,369
You guys.

68
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:39,274
Airport. Airport. Ross. Not alone.

69
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,478
Julie. Arm around her.

70
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,358
Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!

71
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,293
I think she's trying to say something.

72
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,353
Quick, get the verbs.

73
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,459
You! You!

74
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,293
You said he liked me! You!

75
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,496
You slowpokes!

76
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,320
That's all right.

77
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,400
We got the bags.

78
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,759
Hi. Hello.

79
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,209
Hi, honey.

80
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,212
This is my sister, Monica.

81
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,315
This is Chandler. Phoebe, hi.

82
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,367
Joey, what up?

83
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:13,317
Hello.

84
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,211
Everyone, this is Julie.

85
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,449
Julie.

86
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,347
I'm not here.

87
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,331
We haven't met.

88
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,399
I make a better impression

89
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,367
without 20 hours of plane on me.

90
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:30,851
And bus.

91
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:32,233
Oh, my God!

92
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:33,333
The screaming guy--

93
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,328
The spitting.

94
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,237
You gotta hear this.

95
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,435
We're on this 200-year-old bus.

96
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:40,269
At least 200.

97
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,349
And the chicken poops in her lap.

98
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,357
I'm so sorry.

99
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,382
I just gave away the ending.

100
00:04:53,493 --> 00:05:00,228
I just heard this story in the cab and it is all I can think about.

102
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,427
This is amazing.

103
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,785
How did this happen?

104
00:05:06,785 --> 00:05:08,332
We were in grad school together.

105
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,955
Haven't seen each other since.

106
00:05:09,955 --> 00:05:11,502
I land in China.

107
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,213
Guess who's in charge?

108
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,248
Julie!

109
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,308
Isn't that great?

110
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,283
Isn't it just kick-you-in-the-crotch,

111
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:23,348
spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

112
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,416
It's an expression.

113
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,453
We just wanted to say a quick hi.

114
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,327
Then we'll see the baby.

115
00:05:32,327 --> 00:05:33,424
Then get sleep.

116
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,530
It's 6:00 tomorrow, our time.

117
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,816
Don't tell us what will happen.

118
00:05:37,816 --> 00:05:39,363
I like surprises.

119
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,436
Bye!

120
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,518
Can I get some coffee?

121
00:05:57,518 --> 00:05:58,547
Sure.

122
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,374
You talk to him yet?

123
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:01,289
No.

124
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,418
Then, no.

125
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,400
What happened to you in China?

126
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:19,728
When last we left,

127
00:06:19,728 --> 00:06:21,212
you were in love with....

128
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,210
I know I was.

129
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,783
But there was this voice

130
00:06:24,783 --> 00:06:28,786
that kept saying ''It'll never happen. Move on.''

132
00:06:28,786 --> 00:06:31,220
You know whose voice it was?

133
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,348
God?

134
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,224
It was you, pal.

135
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,229
Maybe it was God doing me.

136
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,898
Aside from being almighty,

137
00:06:41,898 --> 00:06:43,530
he's a wiz at doing voices.

138
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,288
You were right. She looks

139
00:06:46,288 --> 00:06:48,239
at me as a friend. That's all.

140
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,238
Then I met Julie, and we're

141
00:06:51,238 --> 00:06:53,234
having a great time.

142
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,411
I never would've gone for it with her,

143
00:06:55,411 --> 00:06:57,476
if not for you.

144
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,311
Well, you owe me one, big guy.

145
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,210
Your lemonade.

146
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,313
Didn't order it.

147
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,788
Then go take that back.

148
00:07:07,788 --> 00:07:09,284
They'll charge you.

149
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:12,193
Go, go, go. Come on, come on.

150
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,291
So, what'd you find out?

151
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:18,294
He said....

152
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,235
He said....

153
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:25,305
He said they're having

154
00:07:25,305 --> 00:07:27,301
a great time. I'm sorry.

155
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:29,780
The silver lining,

156
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,830
if you wanna see it is that he made this decision

158
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,916
by himself without any outside help

160
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,412
whatsoever.

161
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,517
How is that a silver lining?

162
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,421
You have to really wanna see it.

163
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,319
Ironically, these guys

164
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:53,270
were picked last in gym.

165
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:54,464
Hey, Pheebs.

166
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,758
You know what I'm thinking?

167
00:07:56,758 --> 00:07:58,242
Oh, okay.

168
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,798
How it's been so long

170
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:07,866
since you've had sex you're wondering

172
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:09,413
if they've changed it?

173
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,383
Not even close.

174
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,309
No. Although now

175
00:08:15,309 --> 00:08:17,192
that's what I'm thinking.

176
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,296
What were you thinking?

177
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,395
You gave the guys great haircuts.

178
00:08:22,395 --> 00:08:24,391
I thought you could do mine.

179
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,338
Oh. No.

180
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:29,196
Why not?

181
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,208
Because I'm just....

182
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,857
I'm incredibly anal,

183
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:34,404
an unbelievable control freak.

184
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,381
No, you're not.

185
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:38,315
I know I'm not, but you are.

186
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,345
I was trying to spare your feelings.

187
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,321
Hold on.

188
00:08:46,321 --> 00:08:47,418
Ross, Julie for you.

189
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,883
Excuse me.

190
00:08:55,883 --> 00:08:57,333
Who gave her our phone number?

191
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,353
Okay, well....

192
00:08:59,353 --> 00:09:01,270
Who had the motive?

193
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,400
Was it the actor?

194
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,372
The chef? The masseuse?

195
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,172
Or was it the guy who's dating her?

196
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,319
Guy who's dating her.

197
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,304
Hey.

198
00:09:19,304 --> 00:09:20,384
Anybody know a good tailor?

199
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,223
Need clothes altered?

200
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,291
No, I'm looking for a man

201
00:09:24,291 --> 00:09:26,287
to draw on me with chalk.

202
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,912
See Frankie. My family's been

203
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:29,425
going to him forever.

204
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,250
He did my first suit when I was 1 5.

205
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,298
No, wait, 1 6.

206
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:38,241
No, excuse me, 1 5.

207
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,404
All right, when was 1 990?

208
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,347
Stop the Q-Tip

209
00:09:45,347 --> 00:09:46,444
when there's resistance.

210
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,394
Okay. Okay.

211
00:09:56,394 --> 00:09:58,328
Sweetheart, I'll see you later.

212
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,422
Okay, bye.

213
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,327
That is so sweet.

214
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,231
Okay. No, you hang up.

215
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,367
No, you--

216
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,246
One, two, three.

217
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,440
You didn't either.

218
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,480
She didn't hang up.

219
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,384
No, you hang up.

220
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,258
You. You.

221
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:41,768
Sorry, I thought

222
00:10:41,768 --> 00:10:43,264
you were talking to me.

223
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,466
Rachel.

224
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,313
I'll just call her back.

225
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,507
I'm sorry. We got disconnected.

226
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,478
No, you hang up.

227
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,321
How did this happen to me?

228
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,324
A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.

229
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,223
Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.

230
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:08,361
Now all of a sudden, he's Ross this really great guy

232
00:11:08,361 --> 00:11:10,357
that I can't have.

233
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:13,336
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.

234
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,236
I know you did.

235
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,467
Hey, you wanna hit Chandler again?

236
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:22,278
I'm just gonna deal with it.

237
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,444
I gotta get out of here.

238
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,404
I don't care what you say.

239
00:11:32,404 --> 00:11:34,452
Something's bothering her.

240
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,493
You know, I think I was 1 6.

241
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:47,472
You know, I think I don't care.

242
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,023
Please, just a little bit

243
00:11:49,023 --> 00:11:50,473
off the back?

244
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,306
I'm still on ''no.''

245
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:55,402
Morning.

246
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,473
Could you close your eyes?

247
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:00,398
No, no, no.

248
00:12:00,398 --> 00:12:02,212
I'm not falling for that again.

249
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,837
What's going on?

250
00:12:05,837 --> 00:12:07,418
I did a stupid thing last night.

251
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,428
What stupid thing?

252
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,765
Paolo, now you've seen everybody

253
00:12:18,765 --> 00:12:21,262
and they've all seen you.

254
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:25,469
How did this happen?

255
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,337
I kind of ran into him last night.

256
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,876
Where?

257
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:31,372
His apartment. Is this juice?

258
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:33,916
Whoa, the fact that you dumped him

259
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:35,548
because he hit on Phoebe?

260
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,869
Oh, God, I know.

261
00:12:37,869 --> 00:12:39,450
I'm pathetic, I'm a loser.

262
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,372
You're not pathetic.

263
00:12:41,372 --> 00:12:42,452
You're just sad.

264
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,293
Upset people do stupid things.

265
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,429
If I had a nickel

266
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:49,494
for every guy I wish I hadn't--

267
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:54,322
But this is

268
00:12:54,322 --> 00:12:56,273
about your horrible mistake.

269
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:00,928
Sorry we're late.

270
00:13:00,928 --> 00:13:02,344
We were....

271
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,405
Well, there was touching.

272
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:11,389
Hey, Ross.

273
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:12,356
Hey, Paolo.

274
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,351
What, uh...?

275
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,219
What are you doing here?

276
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,230
I do Raquel.

277
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,272
So he's back?

278
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:29,807
Yeah, he's back.

279
00:13:29,807 --> 00:13:31,240
Is that a problem?

280
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:32,435
No, not a problem.

281
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,236
Good. Glad it's not a problem.

282
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,449
You're gonna have to not touch my ass.

283
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,887
Well, despite the yummy bagels

284
00:13:43,887 --> 00:13:48,360
and palpable tension my pants need to be altered.

286
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,373
When you see Frankie,

287
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:52,352
tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello.

288
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,389
He'll know what it means.

289
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:59,368
You sure he'll crack that code?

290
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:02,371
It's funny. The last time Paolo

291
00:14:02,371 --> 00:14:04,436
was here, my hair was so much cuter.

292
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,336
All right.

293
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,394
You have to promise that you

294
00:14:09,394 --> 00:14:14,209
will not be control-y and bossy and all Monica about it.

296
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,838
I promise.

297
00:14:16,838 --> 00:14:18,322
All right, let's see.

298
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,387
Now, some of you are gonna get cut

299
00:14:20,387 --> 00:14:22,417
and some of you aren't.

300
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,358
But I promise

301
00:14:25,358 --> 00:14:27,354
none of you will feel a thing.

302
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,445
That's it. I quit.

303
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:43,345
What? I didn't say anything.

304
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,316
This isn't the face

305
00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:47,250
of a person who trusts a person.

306
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:53,381
This is the face of a person who doesn't trust a person.

308
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,290
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

309
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,345
It's just a little shorter

310
00:14:57,345 --> 00:14:59,296
than what we had discussed.

311
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,895
Would you relax?

312
00:15:00,895 --> 00:15:02,425
I know what I am doing.

313
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,397
This is how he wears it.

314
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,822
How who wears it?

315
00:15:08,822 --> 00:15:10,238
Demi Moore.

316
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,311
Demi Moore is not a ''he.''

317
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:14,795
Well, he was a ''he''

318
00:15:14,795 --> 00:15:16,245
in Arthur and in 10.

319
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,443
That's Dudley Moore.

320
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,447
I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.

321
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,412
Oh, my God.

322
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,414
Oh, God.

323
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,321
Oh, my God! I'm sorry!

324
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,228
Which is Demi Moore?

325
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:35,783
She's the actress that was in

326
00:15:35,783 --> 00:15:38,234
Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost.

327
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,463
She's got gorgeous hair.

328
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,228
I know.

329
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,275
I wanted to look like her.

330
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,426
You know, my mom's dead.

331
00:15:48,426 --> 00:15:50,474
Oh, my God.

332
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,485
Well, this is what my butt

333
00:15:59,485 --> 00:16:01,481
must look like to a fly.

334
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,809
How long do you want the cuffs?

335
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:08,289
At least as long as I have the pants.

336
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,203
I just got that.

337
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:20,207
Now we'll do your inseam.

338
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,841
How is she?

339
00:16:34,841 --> 00:16:37,224
It's too soon to tell.

340
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,458
She's resting, which is a good sign.

341
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:43,223
How's the hair?

342
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:44,899
I'm not gonna lie to you.

343
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:46,429
It doesn't look good.

344
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,311
There's nothing you can do?

345
00:16:53,311 --> 00:16:56,246
At this point, it's a waiting game.

346
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,378
I put a clip on one side,

347
00:16:58,378 --> 00:17:00,374
which seems to stop the curling.

348
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,378
Can we see her?

349
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:04,355
Your hair looks too good.

350
00:17:04,355 --> 00:17:06,289
It would upset her.

351
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,259
Ross, why don't you come on in?

352
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:16,850
Well, how you doing?

353
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:18,266
I'm okay.

354
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,417
That bad, huh?

355
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:20,497
What?

356
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,838
I can sense when women

357
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:24,436
are depressed and vulnerable.

358
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,405
It's one of my gifts.

359
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,368
Joey, when I saw him

360
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:36,888
get off that plane with her I really thought

362
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:38,355
I hit rock bottom.

363
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,771
But today, it's like

364
00:17:40,771 --> 00:17:46,260
there's rock bottom 50 feet of crap then me.

367
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,264
Tell Ross how you feel.

368
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,847
How can I just tell him?

369
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,360
What about Julie?

370
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,934
What about her?

371
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:55,430
It's only been two weeks.

372
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,737
Ross has been in love

373
00:17:57,737 --> 00:17:59,233
with you for 10 years.

374
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,275
I don't know. I don't know.

375
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,179
I've been with my share of women.

376
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,814
I've been with a lot

377
00:18:06,814 --> 00:18:08,378
of people's share of women.

378
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:13,854
But the point is I've never felt about anyone

380
00:18:13,854 --> 00:18:16,385
the way Ross felt about you.

381
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,193
Really?

382
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,304
Yo, paesan.

383
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,210
Can I talk to you for a sec?

384
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:39,409
Your tailor is a very bad man.

386
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,321
What are you talking about?

387
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,356
Hey, what's going on?

388
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:57,527
Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.

390
00:18:58,437 --> 00:18:59,352
What?

391
00:18:59,352 --> 00:19:00,267
No way.

392
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,789
I've been going to him for years.

393
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:05,206
He said he was doing my inseam.

394
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,228
Then he ran his hand up my leg

395
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:09,179
and there was definite--

396
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,270
What?

397
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,376
Cupping.

398
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,287
That's how they do pants.

399
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,820
First, they go up one side,

400
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,316
they move it over.

401
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,924
Then, up the other side,

402
00:19:24,924 --> 00:19:27,421
move it back. Then they do the rear.

403
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,848
Isn't that how a tailor

404
00:19:30,848 --> 00:19:32,395
measures pants?

405
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,718
Yes, yes, it is.

406
00:19:34,718 --> 00:19:36,231
In prison.

407
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,215
What's the matter with you?

408
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,305
What?

409
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,444
That's not?

410
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:57,353
Oh, my God.

411
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,428
I'll put on a pot of coffee.

412
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:11,809
Even Mary Tyler Moore

413
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:13,276
would've been better.

414
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,876
Come on. It's not that bad.

415
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:18,372
You never know.

416
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,350
Bell-bottoms came back.

417
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,479
I like it.

418
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,448
I do. I think it's a 10.

419
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,350
Thank you.

420
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,293
My hair is amused.

421
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,457
Come on, things could be worse.

422
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,478
You could ''get caught between

423
00:20:36,478 --> 00:20:38,457
the moon and New York City.''

424
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:43,407
''It's crazy, but it's true.''

425
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,503
Thank you.

426
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,372
Well, I gotta go. Bye.

427
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,898
Bye, Rach.

428
00:20:50,898 --> 00:20:52,382
Wait, are you leaving?

429
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,317
That's what I meant by ''bye.''

430
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,355
Can I talk to you for a sec?

431
00:20:57,355 --> 00:20:59,323
Okay.

432
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:02,822
When the doctor does

433
00:21:02,822 --> 00:21:04,318
that hernia test....

434
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,424
That's okay.

435
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:13,333
If your mechanic does it....

436
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,273
What's going on?

437
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:26,478
Well, okay, first of all Paolo and I are not back together.

439
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,243
That was a stupid thing I did.

440
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:30,850
If I could go back in time

441
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:34,448
and do it again well, I wouldn't.

443
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,259
Second of all....

444
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:40,487
What?

445
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,464
Is this one of those things

446
00:21:45,464 --> 00:21:49,938
where you break up with a guy I tell you what I think,

448
00:21:49,938 --> 00:21:53,844
you get back together with him and I look like a complete idiot?

450
00:21:53,844 --> 00:21:55,311
No.

451
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,507
Well, then, I think the guy's scum.

452
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,866
I hate him. I actually--

453
00:22:01,866 --> 00:22:03,413
I physically hate him.

454
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,315
I always have.

455
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:08,337
And you are way too good

456
00:22:08,337 --> 00:22:10,316
to be with a guy like that.

457
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,321
Really?

458
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:14,346
You deserve someone

459
00:22:14,346 --> 00:22:18,333
who appreciates you and who gets how funny

461
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:24,231
and sweet and amazing and adorable and sexy you are.

463
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,907
You know? Someone who wakes up

464
00:22:25,907 --> 00:22:30,475
every morning thinking ''Oh, my God. I'm with Rachel.''

466
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,000
You know?

467
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,450
Someone who makes you feel good.

468
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,278
Like the way I do with Julie.

469
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,359
Was there a ''second of all''?

470
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:54,370
No, I think that was the whole ''all.''

471
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,469
I gotta go. Okay. Okay.

472
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:01,926
Okay.

473
00:23:01,926 --> 00:23:02,506
Okay.

474
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,817
No, I swear to God, Dad.

475
00:23:10,817 --> 00:23:13,314
That's not how they measure pants.

476
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,348
I was thinking shorter,

477
00:23:21,348 --> 00:23:23,265
like Andie MacDowell's haircut.

478
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,398
Yeah, I could do that.

479
00:23:24,398 --> 00:23:25,461
Really?

480
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:26,902
You wanna do it now?

481
00:23:26,902 --> 00:23:27,533
Great!

482
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:31,434
See you.

483
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:33,927
I just wanna make

484
00:23:33,927 --> 00:23:35,377
really sure this time.

485
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:37,898
Andie MacDowell is the girl from

486
00:23:37,898 --> 00:23:40,349
Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?

487
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:42,275
No.

488
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,254
That's Roddy McDowall.

489
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,360
Andie MacDowell is the guy

490
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,260
from Planet of the Apes.

491
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,829
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

492
00:23:54,829 --> 00:23:56,393
You're welcome.
