1
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:09,238
Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree.

2
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:11,390
And oh, my God, you should see

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:13,438
the size of his Christmas balls!

4
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:16,912
Hey. How much did

5
00:00:16,912 --> 00:00:18,442
you guys tip the super?

6
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:20,451
We were gonna give 50

7
00:00:20,451 --> 00:00:22,351
but we don't wanna look bad.

8
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,855
This year we made him cookies.

9
00:00:24,855 --> 00:00:27,255
And 25 it is.

10
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:30,758
You gave him cookies?

11
00:00:30,758 --> 00:00:32,254
Money is so impersonal.

12
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,357
Cookies says someone really cares.

13
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:37,385
All right, we're broke.

14
00:00:37,385 --> 00:00:39,302
But cookies do say that.

15
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,437
I can see that. A plate of brownies

16
00:00:41,437 --> 00:00:43,502
once told me a limerick.

17
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:47,478
Pheebs, let me ask you,

18
00:00:47,478 --> 00:00:49,378
were these ''funny'' brownies?

19
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:51,573
Not especially.

20
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,411
But I think they had pot in them.

21
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:00,417
So who else did you tip with cookies?

22
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:03,257
The mailman, the super....

23
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:06,455
And the newspaper delivery guy.

24
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,234
Oh, my God.

25
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,351
What?

26
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:13,433
I don't think you're gonna like this.

27
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,459
There's a cookie smashed

28
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:19,376
to the sports section.

29
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,380
He did my crossword puzzle.

30
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:23,461
Yeah, but not very well, unless

31
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:27,867
1 4 across, ''Gershwin musical'' actually is ''Bite me,

32
00:01:27,867 --> 00:01:29,448
bite me, bite me.''

33
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,903
I can't believe

34
00:02:18,903 --> 00:02:20,336
it's Christmas already.

35
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,391
One day you're eating turkey,

36
00:02:22,391 --> 00:02:25,873
the next thing you know lords are a-leaping

37
00:02:25,873 --> 00:02:27,369
and geese are a-laying.

38
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:30,311
Which is why geese are

39
00:02:30,311 --> 00:02:32,341
so relaxed this time of year.

40
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,366
Hey, guys.

41
00:02:34,366 --> 00:02:35,446
Hey.

42
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,305
Hey, Rach.

43
00:02:39,305 --> 00:02:41,353
I got you a little present.

44
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,397
I'll open it.

45
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:50,266
It's a Slinky! Remember?

46
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,332
Walks downstairs

47
00:02:51,332 --> 00:02:52,361
Alone or in pairs

48
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:55,270
Everyone knows it's--

49
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,401
Just a big spring.

50
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,958
You're still mad because of the--

51
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:03,438
List of reasons not to be with me?

52
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,280
How about we just call it

53
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,310
the ''unfortunate incident''?

54
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:13,224
Gunther, you got stairs in your place?

55
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,372
Yeah.

56
00:03:14,372 --> 00:03:15,418
Go nuts.

57
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,443
Hey, guys.

58
00:03:18,443 --> 00:03:19,523
Hey.

59
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,946
What's in the bag?

60
00:03:21,946 --> 00:03:23,459
Just some presents.

61
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,262
Come on, show us what you bought.

62
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,341
You know you want to.

63
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,232
Okay.

64
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,926
This is a picture frame

65
00:03:34,926 --> 00:03:36,473
from Ben to my parents.

66
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,376
Oh, that's cute.

67
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,868
Some ''Hers'' and ''Hers'' towels

68
00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:43,285
for Susan and Carol.

69
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:48,350
And I got this blouse for Mom.

70
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,874
Ross, that is gorgeous!

71
00:03:50,874 --> 00:03:53,354
Look at these authentic fake medals!

72
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,379
Mom's gonna be voted ''Best Dressed''

73
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:59,359
at the make-believe military academy.

74
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,772
Happy ''Christmas Eve Eve.''

75
00:04:03,772 --> 00:04:05,302
You too.

76
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:06,374
Oh, my God!

77
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:07,403
Where did you get this?

78
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:09,260
Macy's, third floor,

79
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,306
Home Furnishings.

80
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,464
This is my father!

81
00:04:12,464 --> 00:04:14,512
This is a picture of my dad.

82
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,354
That's the guy

83
00:04:18,354 --> 00:04:19,451
that comes in the frame.

84
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,272
No, it's my dad.

85
00:04:21,272 --> 00:04:22,318
I'll show you.

86
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,396
I thought your dad was in prison.

87
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:26,364
No, that's my stepdad.

88
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,428
My real dad's the one that

89
00:04:28,428 --> 00:04:30,424
ran out on us before I was born.

90
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,371
How have you never been on Oprah?

91
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,265
Look, see? This is him.

92
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,407
My mother gave me this picture

93
00:04:38,407 --> 00:04:40,472
before she died. Same guy!

94
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,865
It's a picture of the frame guy posing

95
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:48,447
in front of a blue screen with a dog.

96
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,773
It's not a blue screen.

97
00:04:50,773 --> 00:04:52,257
It's just....

98
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:53,905
Maybe it was just

99
00:04:53,905 --> 00:04:55,452
really clear that day.

100
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,847
Okay, I have to talk

101
00:04:58,847 --> 00:05:00,297
to my grandmother.

102
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,896
Wait a minute, honey.

103
00:05:01,896 --> 00:05:03,392
Pheebs!

104
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,258
So I'm trying to get my boss' ex-wife

105
00:05:09,258 --> 00:05:11,209
to sleep with me.

106
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,335
Joey!

107
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,912
But when Phoebe has a problem,

108
00:05:14,912 --> 00:05:17,312
everyone's all ears.

109
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,251
Esther Livingston.

110
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,246
Gone!

111
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,224
Hi, Pooh.

112
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,319
Hi, Gram. What you doing?

113
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,366
Just updating the phone book.

114
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:37,247
Gram? Can I see the pictures

115
00:05:37,247 --> 00:05:39,226
of my dad again?

116
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:42,341
Oh. Oh, sure, sure.

117
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:45,875
How come?

118
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,473
Just, you know, to see him.

119
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,238
Sure. Yeah.

120
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,918
This is the one

121
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:54,385
of your father in a meadow.

122
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:59,290
And helping a little boy fly a kite.

123
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:03,190
And here he is at a graduation.

124
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,222
Another graduation.

125
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,201
Another graduation.

126
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,206
Is this really my father?

127
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,921
Is it really your fa--?

128
00:06:16,921 --> 00:06:19,435
Well, of course it is.

129
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,881
I smell smoke. Maybe because

130
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:25,349
someone's pants are on fire!

131
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,883
All the time we've been

132
00:06:27,883 --> 00:06:32,224
grandmother and granddaughter you've never lied to me.

133
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,873
All right, that's not your father.

134
00:06:34,873 --> 00:06:37,421
It's a picture of a guy in a frame.

135
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,227
Oh, God.

136
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,434
It was your mother's idea.

137
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,948
She didn't want you to know your real

138
00:06:44,948 --> 00:06:47,428
father because he hurt her so much.

139
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,467
I didn't want to do it.

140
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,358
But then she died

141
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:54,440
and it was harder to argue with her.

142
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,374
Not impossible, but harder.

143
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,334
All right. So he's not

144
00:07:00,334 --> 00:07:02,217
a famous tree surgeon?

145
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,391
And I guess he doesn't live in a hut

146
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:10,490
in Burma where there's no phones?

147
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:12,861
Last I heard, he was

148
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:14,425
a pharmacist somewhere upstate.

149
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,698
That makes no sense. Why would

150
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:20,195
the villagers worship a pharmacist?

151
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,402
Honey.

152
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,211
Oh. Yeah.

153
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:30,204
Anyway, that's all I know.

154
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:37,322
That...and this.

155
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:44,262
This...is the real him.

156
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,348
I remember my father dressed

157
00:07:51,348 --> 00:07:55,424
in the red suit, the black boots and the patent leather belt,

158
00:07:55,424 --> 00:07:57,375
sneaking around.

159
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:58,910
He didn't want us to see

160
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,909
but he'd be drunk so he'd crash into something

161
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:03,405
and wake everyone.

162
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:05,713
That doesn't sound like

163
00:08:05,713 --> 00:08:07,209
a very merry Christmas.

164
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,379
Who said anything about Christmas?

165
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,758
Hi.

166
00:08:13,758 --> 00:08:15,225
Anyone hear from Phoebe yet?

167
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,386
No, nothing.

168
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:18,811
I hope she's okay.

169
00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:20,426
I know what she's going through.

170
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,191
How do you know that?

171
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,395
She told us.

172
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:29,803
What you got there, Monica?

173
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:31,299
Party stuff.

174
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,860
Aren't you guys supposed

175
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,310
to be shopping?

176
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,798
You didn't buy presents? Tomorrow's

177
00:08:36,798 --> 00:08:39,249
Christmas Eve! What are you gonna do?

178
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,331
Don't you have to be Claymation

179
00:08:41,331 --> 00:08:43,310
to say stuff like that?

180
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,819
I don't think the mailman

181
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:47,315
liked your cookies.

182
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,352
Here are the ornaments your mom sent.

183
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,348
Maybe the mailman liked them.

184
00:08:55,348 --> 00:08:57,464
We just didn't give him enough.

185
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,297
Monica, pigeons learn faster than you.

186
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:11,295
Hey, Rach. I think I know

187
00:09:11,295 --> 00:09:13,308
what will make you feel better.

188
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,287
How about you make a list about me?

189
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,340
Forget it. I'm not gonna stand here

190
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,291
and make a list--

191
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:24,863
Okay, you're whiny you are obsessive.

192
00:09:24,863 --> 00:09:27,331
You are insecure. You're gutless.

193
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,198
You never just seize the day.

194
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,215
You liked me for a year

195
00:09:32,215 --> 00:09:34,194
and you didn't do anything about it.

196
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,871
And you wear too much

197
00:09:35,871 --> 00:09:37,435
of that gel in your hair.

198
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,312
See, there, you....

199
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:45,411
All right, you did what I said.

200
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:48,431
And you know what? You're right.

201
00:09:48,431 --> 00:09:51,411
I do feel better. Thank you, Ross.

202
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,780
Yeah, in Albany. Could I have

203
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:01,231
the number of Frank Buffay?

204
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,527
Okay. In Ithaca?

205
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:08,338
All right, Saratoga?

206
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,442
Oneonta?

207
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,858
You know what? You shouldn't

208
00:10:12,858 --> 00:10:14,439
call yourself ''Information''!

209
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,249
Hello, Grandma. If that is,

210
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:25,245
in fact, your real name.

211
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,421
Come on now, Pooh.

212
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:29,451
Don't still be mad at me.

213
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,359
How's it going?

214
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:32,456
Not so good.

215
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,479
Upstate's pretty big.

216
00:10:35,479 --> 00:10:37,492
He's pretty small. You do the math.

217
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,851
Well, I think you're better off

218
00:10:39,851 --> 00:10:41,398
without him.

219
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,498
Honey, I know he's your daddy.

220
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,328
But to me,

221
00:10:46,328 --> 00:10:49,895
he's still the irresponsible creep who locked up your mom

222
00:10:49,895 --> 00:10:51,476
and stole her Gremlin.

223
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,448
I know. I just wanted to know

224
00:10:54,448 --> 00:10:56,478
who he was, you know?

225
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,323
Yeah, I know.

226
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,843
Okay. I wasn't completely honest

227
00:11:03,843 --> 00:11:09,426
with you when I said I didn't know exactly where he lived.

228
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,333
What do you mean?

229
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,338
He lives at 74 Laurel Drive

230
00:11:14,338 --> 00:11:17,239
in Middletown.

231
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,343
If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've

232
00:11:20,343 --> 00:11:22,442
gone too far. You can take my cab.

233
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:26,247
Wow! Thank you.

234
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,449
Remember, nobody else drives that cab.

235
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,468
Got it.

236
00:11:32,468 --> 00:11:34,447
Oh, I'm gonna see my dad!

237
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,461
Thank you.

238
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:42,265
Wish me luck, Grandpa.

239
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,569
Phoebe here with the cab yet?

240
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,396
Yeah, she brought the invisible cab.

241
00:11:55,396 --> 00:11:57,313
Hop in!

242
00:11:58,284 --> 00:11:59,347
She'd better come.

243
00:11:59,347 --> 00:12:00,410
The stores close at 7.

244
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,950
It'll be two hours to Phoebe's dad's

245
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,447
house. They'll meet, swap stories.

246
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,789
Even if she tells the one where she's

247
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:11,320
an Egyptian slave, we'll have time.

248
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,294
Hey, here she comes!

249
00:12:13,294 --> 00:12:14,357
Hey.

250
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:24,454
Can you believe this?

251
00:12:24,454 --> 00:12:26,467
In two hours I'm gonna have a dad.

252
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,394
Yeah, big stuff!

253
00:12:29,394 --> 00:12:31,242
Okay, let's go!

254
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,251
Here, you have to hold this.

255
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,446
''Brake left, gas right''?

256
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:42,292
Yeah, that's my cheat sheet.

257
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:45,947
Where's my seat belt?

258
00:12:45,947 --> 00:12:47,397
There isn't one.

259
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:50,401
The paramedics had to cut through it.

260
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:03,732
Come on, just tell me.

261
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:05,216
Please, please!

262
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,313
For the 1 6th time:

263
00:13:07,313 --> 00:13:09,309
No, I do not think you're obsessive!

264
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,417
It's hot in here!

265
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,409
Rach, get the heat.

266
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:16,360
Ross, turn the heat down, please?

267
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,345
The difference between obsessive--

268
00:13:18,345 --> 00:13:20,262
Ross, the heat!

269
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,431
Okay! Heat, heat, heat!

270
00:13:22,431 --> 00:13:24,530
And I'm the obsessive one?

271
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:28,372
Okay. This way is on.

272
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:35,345
So this is...off.

273
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,845
Did you just break the radiator?

274
00:13:38,845 --> 00:13:43,455
No, I was turning the knob and here it is.

275
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,349
Well, put it back!

276
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,828
It won't go back.

277
00:13:50,828 --> 00:13:52,295
I'll call the super.

278
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,490
Here, let me try.

279
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,314
That's right. I forgot about

280
00:13:56,314 --> 00:13:58,362
your ability to fuse metal.

281
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,337
Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny!

282
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,755
Hi, Mr. Treeger?

283
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:05,302
It's Rachel Greene from upstairs.

284
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,311
Yes, somebody broke our knob

285
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:12,216
on the radiator and it's really hot in here.

286
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:16,254
Yes, it's hot enough to bake cookies.

287
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:18,355
Do you think we could

288
00:14:18,355 --> 00:14:20,255
have a new one by 6?

289
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,407
Tuesday? We can't wait until then.

290
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:24,455
We're having a party tonight.

291
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,357
Okay, tip the man.

292
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,445
If he doesn't like our cookies,

293
00:14:28,445 --> 00:14:30,458
too bad! I won't be blackmailed.

294
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,902
Look, if it gets a little warm,

295
00:14:32,902 --> 00:14:34,534
it can be a theme party.

296
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,253
Here's a theme:

297
00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:39,232
''Come on in! Live like bacon!''

298
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,340
This is it, 74!

299
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:49,254
Oh, so that's what this is for.

300
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:52,480
This is it. I'm gonna meet my dad.

301
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,874
This is like the biggest thing ever.

302
00:14:54,874 --> 00:14:56,489
Sure is.

303
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,288
Okay, here I go. I'm going in.

304
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,410
All right!

305
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,422
Good luck, Pheebs.

306
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,397
Okay. Here I go.

307
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,297
Here I go.

308
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,309
I'm going.

309
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,323
Hi. Welcome to our tropical

310
00:15:26,323 --> 00:15:28,223
Christmas party.

311
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,791
You can put your coats, sweaters,

312
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,322
pants and shirts in the bedroom.

313
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,932
It's hard to tell because I'm sweating

314
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:39,531
but I use what the gel bottle says.

315
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:44,422
An amount about the size of a pea.

316
00:15:44,422 --> 00:15:46,470
How can that be too much?

317
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,279
Ice?

318
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,818
Ice? Ice squares anyone?

319
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:56,286
Take a napkin. All right.

320
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,347
Monica!

321
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,842
Monica, your guests

322
00:16:00,842 --> 00:16:02,326
are turning into jerky.

323
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:05,329
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable.

324
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:07,297
Hey! Get in line, buddy.

325
00:16:07,297 --> 00:16:09,197
I was next.

326
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:13,900
Mr. Treeger.

327
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,396
You said there was a party.

328
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,420
Oh. Yeah.

329
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,399
Well, hey, welcome to our sauna.

330
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,328
Is it hot?

331
00:16:21,328 --> 00:16:23,211
My body always stays cool.

332
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,409
Probably because I have so much skin.

333
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,318
Hey, cheese!

334
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:31,337
Here's the chance.

335
00:16:31,337 --> 00:16:32,452
Monica, give him cash.

336
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,721
Rachel, give him your earrings.

337
00:16:34,721 --> 00:16:36,217
Anything!

338
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,778
No, I will not cave.

339
00:16:37,778 --> 00:16:39,228
I'm with Mon.

340
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,845
All right. You know how you say

341
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:42,426
I never seize the day?

342
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,382
Even though he's your super,

343
00:16:44,382 --> 00:16:46,230
I'm seizing.

344
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,434
Mr. Treeger?

345
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,243
Here is $50. Merry Christmas.

346
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,542
Oh, wow. I didn't get you anything.

347
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,273
Here's five back.

348
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:02,384
No, that's your Christmas tip.

349
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:04,871
Do you think there's a chance

350
00:17:04,871 --> 00:17:07,254
you can fix that radiator now?

351
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,823
No can do. Like I told the girl,

352
00:17:09,823 --> 00:17:12,320
I can't get a knob until Tuesday.

353
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,298
Ross?

354
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:16,198
Looks like he's playing baseball.

355
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,236
You mean hardball?

356
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,330
Whatever.

357
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,889
Whatcha gonna do?

358
00:17:24,889 --> 00:17:26,436
Excuse me. I'm seizing.

359
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,440
Mr. Treeger?

360
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,332
Here's another 50.

361
00:17:31,332 --> 00:17:33,249
Happy Hanukkah.

362
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:36,310
Will this help with the knob-getting?

363
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,855
No, the place is not open

364
00:17:38,855 --> 00:17:41,255
till Tuesday.

365
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,453
Am I not saying it right?

366
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,261
So you really did like my cookies?

367
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,863
Yeah, they were so personal.

368
00:17:49,863 --> 00:17:52,360
It really showed you cared.

369
00:17:56,442 --> 00:18:00,309
Nice seizing gel boy.

370
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,409
So is this mistletoe?

371
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,387
No, that....

372
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,186
That is basil.

373
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,258
If it was mistletoe,

374
00:18:18,258 --> 00:18:20,288
I was gonna kiss you.

375
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,233
No, it's still basil.

376
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,341
Okay.

377
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:40,246
How far did you get?

378
00:18:40,246 --> 00:18:41,241
Mailbox.

379
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,312
All right, we're getting closer.

380
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,324
What's going on?

381
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,327
It's just like a whole mess of stuff.

382
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,846
Like yesterday, my dad was this

383
00:18:52,846 --> 00:18:55,263
famous Burma tree-surgeon guy.

384
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,898
And you know, now he's

385
00:18:56,898 --> 00:18:58,462
a pharmacist guy and....

386
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,217
Well, maybe he's this

387
00:19:01,217 --> 00:19:03,196
really cool pharmacist guy.

388
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,323
Yeah, maybe!

389
00:19:05,323 --> 00:19:09,693
And I'll knock on the door and he'll hug me

390
00:19:09,693 --> 00:19:11,206
and I'll have a dad!

391
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,234
I'll go to his pharmacy and

392
00:19:13,234 --> 00:19:16,754
everyone will be nice to me because, you know,

393
00:19:16,754 --> 00:19:18,221
I'm Frank's daughter.

394
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,191
So why not go knock?

395
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,876
Because, I mean, what if

396
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:28,424
he's not this great-dad guy?

397
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,333
What if he's still the dirt-bag

398
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,432
who ran out on my mom and us?

399
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,299
Yeah.

400
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,308
You know what?

401
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,328
I've already lost

402
00:19:42,328 --> 00:19:44,211
a fake dad this week.

403
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,730
I don't think I'm ready

404
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,243
to lose a real one.

405
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,472
Pheebs, that's okay.

406
00:19:51,472 --> 00:19:53,423
You took a big step today.

407
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:55,391
Yeah?

408
00:19:55,391 --> 00:19:56,323
Yeah.

409
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,396
Someday, when you're ready,

410
00:19:58,396 --> 00:20:00,364
you'll make it past the hedges.

411
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,332
And when you do,

412
00:20:02,332 --> 00:20:04,232
he'll be lucky to have you.

413
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,462
You guys....

414
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,441
Sorry about your shopping.

415
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:13,410
Oh, that's okay.

416
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,344
We'll figure something out.

417
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:21,480
I know you're not going in there but would it be okay if I went in

418
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,476
and used his bathroom?

419
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,390
That's fine, never mind.

420
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,357
Cool, snow!

421
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,261
Kind of like a blank canvas.

422
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,969
Ho-ho-ho-holy crap,

423
00:20:42,969 --> 00:20:44,465
is it hot in here!

424
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,280
Mind if I turn the heat down?

425
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,928
We could have used

426
00:20:50,928 --> 00:20:52,475
that kind of thinking earlier!

427
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,508
So, Pheebs, how did it go?

428
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,278
Oh, I couldn't go in.

429
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:58,351
Honey, I'm sorry.

430
00:20:58,351 --> 00:20:59,380
Are you okay?

431
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,874
Yeah, it's okay

432
00:21:00,874 --> 00:21:02,324
because I know he's there.

433
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,329
So that's enough for now.

434
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:05,942
It's after midnight!

435
00:21:05,942 --> 00:21:07,455
Merry Christmas, everyone!

436
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:11,327
Oh, right! Merry Christmas!

437
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,820
The knob was broken so I turned it off

438
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,368
from underneath. I hope that's okay.

439
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,381
Thanks.

440
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,469
I guess that just leaves the gifts

441
00:21:33,469 --> 00:21:35,448
from Joey and Chandler.

442
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,464
Rach, these are for you.

443
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,461
Wiper blades!

444
00:21:42,461 --> 00:21:44,457
I don't even have a car.

445
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,266
No, but with this new-car smell,

446
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:49,262
you'll think you do!

447
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,268
Okay, Pheebs, your turn.

448
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,477
Toilet-seat covers!

449
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:05,769
Is that what you were doing

450
00:22:05,769 --> 00:22:08,317
while I was getting gas? You guys!

451
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:12,321
And for Ross Mr. Sweet Tooth.

452
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,368
You got me a cola drink?

453
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,371
And a lemon-lime!

454
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,854
Well, this is too much! I feel like

455
00:22:24,854 --> 00:22:27,334
I should get you another sweater.

456
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,349
And last but not least....

457
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,481
They're ribbed for your pleasure!
