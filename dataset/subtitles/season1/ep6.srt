1
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:08,332
Oh, Iook! There's Joey's picture!

2
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,467
This is so exciting!

3
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:13,235
You can spot someone who's
never seen his pIays.

4
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:16,440
Notice, no fear.
No sense of impending doom.

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:22,444
''The roIe of man number three
wiII not be pIayed by Vic Shapiro.''

6
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,287
We came on the wrong night.

7
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:29,257
I can't beIieve I forgot a magazine.

8
00:00:29,295 --> 00:00:32,287
-Come on, this might be good.
-I don't know.

9
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:37,302
The excIamation point scares me.
It's not just <i>Freud,</i> it's <i>Freud!</i>

10
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:40,373
Magic is about to happen!

11
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,500
WeII, Eva...

12
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:46,468
...we've done
some exceIIent work here.

13
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:49,475
And I wouId have to say...

14
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:54,285
...your probIem is quite cIear.

15
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:59,288
<i>All you want is a dinkle</i>

16
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:02,327
<i>What you envy's a schwang</i>

17
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:05,525
<i>A thing through which you can tinkle</i>

18
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,427
<i>To play with or simply let hang</i>

19
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,442
The One With the Butt

20
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,344
I feeI vioIated.

21
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:29,339
Did anybody eIse feeI Iike
peeIing their skin off...

22
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,247
...to have something eIse to do?

23
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,341
Ross, 10:00.

24
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,286
Is it? It feeIs Iike 2.

25
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:40,290
-No, 10:00!
-What?

26
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,456
There's a beautifuI woman
at 8, 9, 10:00!

27
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,458
HeIIo!

28
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,405
She's amazing! She makes the women I
dream about Iook Iike fat, baId men.

29
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:55,464
Go over.
She's not with anyone.

30
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:59,308
And what wouId my opening Iine be?
Excuse me....

31
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:04,245
Come on, she's a person.
You can do it.

32
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,319
CouId she be more out of my Ieague?
Back me up.

33
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,220
He couIdn't get a woman
Iike that in a miIIion years.

34
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:16,327
You aIways see these beautifuI
women with ''nothing'' guys.

35
00:03:16,429 --> 00:03:19,262
You couId be one of those guys.

36
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,356
-You couId do that.
-You think?

37
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,231
AbsoIuteIy!

38
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,361
I can't beIieve
I'm considering this.

39
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,338
-I'm very aware of my tongue.
-Come on.

40
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,341
Here goes.

41
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:33,435
Stand back, everyone.
Incoming ego shrapneI.

42
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,340
AII right, I can do this.

43
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:42,346
-Yes?
-Hi.

44
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,480
Okay, next word wouId be...

45
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,259
...ChandIer.

46
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,556
ChandIer is my name and....

47
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,297
Hi!

48
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,265
Yes, you said that.

49
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:59,294
Yes! Yes, I did.
But what I didn't say....

50
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,339
What I wanted to say was...

51
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:05,309
...wouId you Iike to go out with me?
Thank you. Good night.

52
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,435
ChandIer?

53
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:13,410
-I didn't know you couId dance!
-You were in a pIay!

54
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,421
What'd you think?

55
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,316
-I didn't know you couId dance!
-You were in a pIay!

56
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,258
It wasn't that bad.
I was the Iead.

57
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:26,424
It was better than the troII thing.
At Ieast you got to see my head.

58
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:29,230
-You're right.
-We saw your head.

59
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,369
How about that accent?

60
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:36,374
Yeah. AII of your W's were V's.

61
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:39,336
She said yes!

62
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,439
AwfuI pIay, man!

63
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:49,347
Her name's Aurora. She's ItaIian
and she pronounces my name ''ChandIer.''

64
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,449
I Iike that better.

65
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,458
The usher gave me this.

66
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:58,253
-What is it?
-The EsteIIe Leonard TaIent Agency.

67
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:01,197
An agency Ieft its card.
They wanna sign me!

68
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,394
Based on this pIay?

69
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,496
Based on this pIay!

70
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,299
Look! There's a note on the back.

71
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:13,210
''Loved your work. CaII me a sap.''

72
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,307
She was obviousIy very moved!

73
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,250
You shouId caII her fairIy quickIy.

74
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,447
Yeah! As soon as possibIe!

75
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,419
Come in!

76
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,328
Hi. I'm here to see EsteIIe Leonard.

77
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,527
Just a moment, Iet me see
if she's in.

78
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,435
HeIIo.

79
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,273
-You're EsteIIe?
-I know...

80
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:45,471
...you weren't expecting someone
so fantasticaIIy beautifuI.

81
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:53,275
Love Iump. Take a Ioad off aIready,
darIing. Sit aIready.

82
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,445
I can't teII you how excited
I am to be here.

83
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:58,484
Why not?

84
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:04,287
-What I meant was--
-You don't mind if I eat, do you?

85
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,324
Joey...

86
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:13,429
...sweetheart, Iet me ask you
a question.

87
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,403
Did you ever see the movie
<i>Sleepless in Seattle</i>?

88
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,305
-Wow! Do you represent those actors?
-No.

89
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:25,247
But you know the end,
where they're happy?

90
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:28,219
That's gonna be you and me.

91
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,450
You mean you wanna sign me?

92
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:36,321
No, I wanna go to the top of the
Empire State BuiIding and make out.

93
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,321
Of course I wanna sign you!

94
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,359
-Miss Leonard, I'm so--
-Oh, boy.

95
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:45,370
-Ride them, cowboy.
-I'm sorry!

96
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,474
I don't see it!

97
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:03,312
-Try to Iook through it.
-Unfocus your eyes.

98
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,290
Focus? There's nothing to focus on.

99
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:10,321
-It's the Statue of Liberty!
-Right!

100
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:13,331
-Where's the Statue of Liberty?
-There.

101
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,333
I can't not see it now.

102
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:18,325
Hey, kids!

103
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,236
Come here. Do you see anything here?

104
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:24,401
-It Iooks Iike a boat.
-A boat.

105
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,441
Right in front of
the Statue of Liberty.

106
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:34,250
It's been seven seconds, and you
haven't asked me how my date went.

107
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,413
How was your date, ChandIer?

108
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,253
It was unbeIievabIe!

109
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:42,226
I've never met anyone Iike her.
She's had an amazing Iife!

110
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,229
<i>She was in the Israeli army.</i>

111
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,426
None of the buIIets hit the engine,
so we made it to the border.

112
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,362
But just bareIy, and I....

113
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,464
I've been taIking about myseIf
aII night Iong. I'm sorry.

114
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,267
What about you? TeII me a story.

115
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,213
AII right, once...

116
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,214
...I got on the subway.

117
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,216
And it was at night...

118
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:08,310
...and I rode it aII the way
to BrookIyn.

119
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:11,185
Just for the heII of it.

120
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,225
We taIked untiI 2:00. It was perfect.

121
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,217
More or Iess.

122
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,422
SuddenIy, we reaIized we were
in Yemen.

123
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:20,424
I'm sorry, so ''we'' is...?

124
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,197
''We'' is me and Rick.

125
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,225
Who's Rick?

126
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,395
Who's Rick?

127
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:27,501
My husband.

128
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,435
-Oh, so you're divorced?
-No.

129
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:38,240
I'm sorry. So you're widowed?
HopefuIIy?

130
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:40,444
No, I'm stiII married.

131
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:46,223
So, how wouId your husband feeI
about you sitting here with me...

132
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:51,422
...sIiding your foot so far up my Ieg
you can count the change in my pocket?

133
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:54,262
Don't worry.

134
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:58,235
He'd be okay with you
because he's okay with Ethan.

135
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,263
Ethan? There's an Ethan?

136
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:05,402
Ethan is my boyfriend.

137
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,270
What?

138
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:12,376
What kind of reIationship
do you imagine us having...

139
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,420
...if you have a husband
and a boyfriend?

140
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:19,214
I suppose, mainIy sexuaI.

141
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,388
Sorry it didn't work out.

142
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:27,290
What, not work out?
I'm seeing her again on Thursday.

143
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,200
Didn't you Iisten to the story?

144
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,431
Didn't you Iisten? It's twisted!

145
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,231
How couId you get invoIved
with her?

146
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:40,301
I had troubIe with it at first.
But I get the good stuff.

147
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,348
AII the fun, aII the taIking,
aII the sex...

148
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,351
...and none of the responsibiIity.

149
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:50,245
-This is every guy's fantasy!
-That's not true!

150
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:54,225
-Ross, is this your fantasy?
-No, of course not.

151
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,429
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

152
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:02,232
You'd go out with someone
going out with someone eIse?

153
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,359
-I couIdn't.
-Good for you.

154
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,337
When I'm with a woman,
I need to know...

155
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:10,365
...I'm going out
with more peopIe than her.

156
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:14,337
Once, I went out with a guy who
just got divorced.

157
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,541
It was hard. His kids Iiked me
better than him.

158
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,479
What does this have to do
with ChandIer?

159
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,388
Nothing.

160
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:26,390
I didn't have anything
on that topic.

161
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,484
So I went another way.

162
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:33,454
You know, monogamy can be
a tricky concept.

163
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:36,496
I mean, anthropoIogicaIIy speaking--

164
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,362
Fine. Now you'II never know.

165
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,304
We're kidding. TeII us.

166
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:44,273
-We wanna know.
-Come on!

167
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:48,279
AII right. There's a theory
put forth by Richard Leakey--

168
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,317
Are we greeting each other
this way now? I Iike it.

169
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,424
Look! I cIeaned!

170
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,262
I did the windows.
I did the fIoors.

171
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:13,328
I used aII the vacuum attachments but
the round one. What's it for?

172
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,431
Nobody knows.
And we're not supposed to ask.

173
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,232
What do you think?

174
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,438
-It's very cIean.
-ReaIIy, it Iooks great!

175
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,284
I see you moved the green ottoman.

176
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,384
How did that happen?

177
00:11:35,261 --> 00:11:37,388
I don't know. It Iooked better there.

178
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,299
And it's an extra seat
around the tabIe.

179
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,367
Yeah, it's interesting.

180
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,363
But you know what? Just for fun...

181
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:51,307
...Iet's see what it Iooked Iike
in the oId spot.

182
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,472
Just to compare.

183
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,308
Let's see.

184
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,415
WeII, it Iooks good there too.

185
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,245
Let's Ieave it there for a whiIe.

186
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,314
I can't beIieve you moved
the green ottoman.

187
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:09,354
Be gIad you didn't fan the magazines.
She'II scratch your eyes out.

188
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:12,454
-You guys, I am not that bad!
-Yeah, you are.

189
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,461
Remember, I Iived with you?
You were a IittIe....

190
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,333
That is so unfair!

191
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:28,369
When we were kids, yours was the onIy
Raggedy Ann doII that wasn't raggedy.

192
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,444
Okay, so I'm responsibIe.
I'm organized.

193
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,476
But hey, I can be a kook!

194
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:39,280
AII right, you madcap gaI!

195
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,249
Imagine this.

196
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:46,297
The phone biII arrives,
but you don't pay it right away.

197
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:49,265
-Why not?
-Because you're a kook!

198
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:53,498
You wait untiI they send a notice.

199
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,270
I couId do that.

200
00:12:56,308 --> 00:13:00,244
Okay, then you Iet me
go grocery shopping--

201
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:03,406
-No probIem.
-I'm not done yet.

202
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:09,244
And I buy detergent, but it's not
the one with the easy-pour spout.

203
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:11,516
Why wouId someone do that?

204
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,352
One might wonder.

205
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,422
But I wouId be fine with that.

206
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:24,368
A gIass is on the tabIe with no
coaster. A coId drink. A hot day.

207
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:29,364
Beads of condensation are inching
cIoser to the wood....

208
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,464
Stop it!

209
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:35,470
Oh, my God!

210
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:38,282
It's true. Who am I?

211
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,452
Monica, you're Mom.

212
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,284
Oh, my God!

213
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,466
Okay, I'II be there.

214
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,395
That was my agent.

215
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:06,300
My agent has just gotten me a job
in the new AI Pacino movie!

216
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:09,313
-That's great!
-What's the part?

217
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:13,408
Can you beIieve it? Pacino!
This guy's why I became an actor!

218
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,419
''Out of order? You're out of order!
This whoIe courtroom's out of order!''

219
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,226
SeriousIy, what's the part?

220
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:26,230
''Just when I thought I was out,
they puII me back in!''

221
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:29,324
Come on. SeriousIy, Joey,
what's the part?

222
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,463
You're.... What?

223
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,434
I'm his butt doubIe, okay?

224
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,475
I pIay AI Pacino's butt.

225
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:50,347
AII right? He goes into the shower,
and then...

226
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,447
...I'm his butt.

227
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,283
Oh, my God!

228
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,451
Come on, you guys.

229
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:59,294
It's a reaI Pacino movie
and that's big!

230
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,198
It's terrific. You deserve this.

231
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:07,194
After years of struggIing you've
cracked your way into show business.

232
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,239
Fine. Make jokes, I don't care.

233
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:15,439
-This is a big break for me!
-You're right. It is.

234
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,208
So, wiII you invite us
to the big opening?

235
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,430
-I need some moisturizer.
-For what?

236
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,223
Today's the big day!

237
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,462
You got any tweezers? I think
I have a rogue hair.

238
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,375
God. Go in the bathroom.
Use whatever you want.

239
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,378
Don't ever teII me what you did
in there.

240
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,346
Thank you.

241
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,252
-Joey's mom's on the phone.
-In the bathroom.

242
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,449
-You don't wanna go in there!
-Come on, we're roommates.

243
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:01,317
My eyes! My eyes!

244
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,389
I warned you.

245
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,392
Who is being Ioud?

246
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,401
Oh, that wouId be Monica.

247
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,328
Can I borrow stuff?
I wanna make Aurora breakfast.

248
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,339
You got the whoIe night?

249
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:18,410
WeII, I onIy have 20 minutes
untiI Ethan, so....

250
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:20,439
Do I sense resentment?

251
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:24,238
No. No resentment. BeIieve me...

252
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,341
...it's worth it, okay?

253
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:31,355
In a reIationship, you have moments
you'II remember the rest of your Iife.

254
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:35,223
Every singIe second is Iike that
with Aurora.

255
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,522
I've just wasted 35 of them
taIking to you.

256
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:41,323
So, Monica, can you
heIp me with the door?

257
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:45,267
The oId Monica wouId remind you...

258
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:49,330
...to scrub that TefIon pan with
a pIastic brush.

259
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,469
But I'm not gonna do that.

260
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:03,415
Excuse me? Can they warm it up?
I'm concerned about goose bumps.

261
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,213
Everybody ready?

262
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,384
I wanna thank you
for this opportunity.

263
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:15,196
I mean, I know this is just a first
step, but I hope that someday--

264
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,256
Lose the robe.

265
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:20,270
Right. Okay. Losing the robe!

266
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,231
Okay, and the robe is Iost.

267
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:26,411
I wouId Iike to get this in one take.

268
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,242
Let's roII it.

269
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,304
Water's working.

270
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,283
And action!

271
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,218
And cut!

272
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:39,289
Butt guy, what are you doing?

273
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,222
I'm showering.

274
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,351
No, that was cIenching.

275
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,331
The way I see it,
the guy's upset here, you know?

276
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:50,231
His wife's dead,
his brother's missing.

277
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:53,238
I think his butt wouId be angry here.

278
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:57,307
I think his butt wouId Iike
to get the shot before Iunch.

279
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,277
Once again, roIIing.
Water working.

280
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,248
And action!

281
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,216
And cut! What was that?

282
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,381
I was going for quiet desperation.

283
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,283
But if you have to ask....

284
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,334
God, I Iove these fingers.

285
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,493
Thank you.

286
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:28,297
No, actuaIIy, I meant my fingers.

287
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,432
Look at them.
Look at how happy they are.

288
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:36,247
-Oh, my God, I'm Iate!
-Oh, no!

289
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:39,317
-Don't go.
-Okay.

290
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,344
-I have to.
-Look, she's Ieaving.

291
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,416
I'm sorry. He'II be waiting for me.

292
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:49,359
-I thought you taIked to Rick.
-It's not Rick.

293
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,259
Ethan? He gets the whoIe day!

294
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,232
No, it's Andrew.

295
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,271
I know there'II be moments...

296
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:05,174
...when I'II regret asking
the foIIowing question, but....

297
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,277
-And Andrew is?
-He's...

298
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:10,280
...new.

299
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:15,284
So you're not compIeteIy fuIfiIIed
by Rick, Ethan and myseIf?

300
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,187
No, that's not exactIy what I was--

301
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:19,417
Most women wouId kiII...

302
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,284
...for three guys Iike us.

303
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:26,421
-So, what do you want?
-You.

304
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:29,394
-You have me.
-No. Just you.

305
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:33,398
-What do you mean?
-Lose the other guys.

306
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:37,298
Like, aII of them?

307
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:40,411
Come on, we're great together.
Why not?

308
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,204
Can't we have what we have now?

309
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,408
Why can't we taIk and make Iove...

310
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,419
...without feeIing obIigated
to each other?

311
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:53,214
Up untiI tonight, I thought
that's what you wanted too.

312
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:57,327
WeII, part of me wants that...

313
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:02,322
...but it's Iike I'm two guys.
One guy's saying, ''This is great!''

314
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,335
But there's this other guy.

315
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:08,236
The guy who weIIs up
when the Grinch's heart grows...

316
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,433
...and breaks that measuring device.

317
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:15,543
He's saying, you know,
''This is too hard. Get out!''

318
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:19,273
So, which one of the guys
wiII you Iisten to?

319
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:25,246
I have to Iisten to both.
They don't Iet each other finish.

320
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,483
Which one?

321
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:32,489
The second guy.

322
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,266
I see.

323
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:42,263
CaII me if you change your mind.

324
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:54,275
Sorry, the first guy runs the Iips.

325
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:09,266
Look at it this way. You dumped her!

326
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:14,431
Right? I mean, this woman was
unbeIievabIy sexy...

327
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:19,240
...and beautifuI, inteIIigent,
unattainabIe.

328
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,440
TeII me why you did this again?

329
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,280
Movie star!

330
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:31,345
Wait! Aren't you the guy who pIays
the butt in the new Pacino movie?

331
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,349
Nope.

332
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:36,293
No? What happened, big guy?

333
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:38,363
Big guy?

334
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,456
It feIt Iike a ''big guy'' moment.

335
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,302
I got fired!

336
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:48,464
They said I acted too much with it.

337
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:52,266
I toId everybody about this!

338
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:55,278
-Everybody's expecting to see me.
-IKnow what?

339
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,577
-No one wiII be abIe to teII.
-My mom wiII.

340
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:04,512
There's something so sweet
and disturbing about that.

341
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,260
I've done crappy pIays
for six years...

342
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,456
...and I finaIIy get my shot,
and I bIow it!

343
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:14,459
Maybe this wasn't it.

344
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:19,465
I think when it's your shot,
you know it's your shot.

345
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:23,241
Did it feeI Iike your shot?

346
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:26,437
Hard to teII. I was naked.

347
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:30,471
I don't think this was it.
I don't think you just get one.

348
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:34,377
I beIieve things are gonna happen
for you. I do.

349
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:38,446
You've got to think about
the day some kid wiII go:

350
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:43,450
''I got the part!
I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!''

351
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:48,489
You think? That's so nice.

352
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:57,398
I'm sorry, Joey.
I'm gonna go to bed, guys.

353
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,569
-Good night.
-Good night.

354
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:02,406
You're gonna Ieave
your shoes out here?

355
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:09,320
ReaIIy? Just casuaIIy
strewn about...

356
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:13,323
...in that reckIess, haphazard manner?

357
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:18,327
It doesn't matter.
I'II get them tomorrow. Or not!

358
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,424
Whenever.

359
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:26,429
She is a kook.

360
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:43,252
<i>If it bothers you that much,</i>
<i>just go out and get the shoes.</i>

361
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,451
<i>No, don't do this!</i>

362
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,356
<i>This is stupid!</i>

363
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:52,295
<i>I don't have to prove anything.</i>
<i>I'm gonna get them.</i>

364
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:55,366
<i>But then everyone will know.</i>

365
00:23:55,467 --> 00:24:00,234
<i>Unless I get them, then wake up</i>
<i>really early and put them back.</i>

366
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:02,398
<i>I need help!</i>

367
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:10,237
<i>-All you want is a dinkle</i>
-Not that song!

368
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:14,308
<i>-All you envy's a schwang</i>
-Come on, you guys.

369
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:18,321
<i>A thing through which you can tinkle</i>

370
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:21,348
<i>Or play with or simply let hang</i>

371
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:26,329
<i>All you want is a dinkle</i>

372
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:29,457
<i>What you envy's a schwang</i>

373
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:33,431
<i>A thing through which you can tinkle</i>

374
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:38,341
<i>Or play with or simply let hang</i>
