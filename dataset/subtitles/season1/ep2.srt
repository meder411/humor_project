1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,456
You don't understand.

2
00:00:04,232 --> 00:00:07,224
For us, kissing is as
important as any part.

3
00:00:07,335 --> 00:00:08,427
Yeah, right!

4
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:12,431
You serious?

5
00:00:13,441 --> 00:00:14,373
Oh, yeah.

6
00:00:14,476 --> 00:00:18,276
-Everything is in that first kiss.
-AbsoIuteIy.

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,247
For us, kissing's an opening act...

8
00:00:21,282 --> 00:00:24,342
...Iike the comedian
you have to sit through...

9
00:00:24,386 --> 00:00:26,377
...before Pink FIoyd comes out.

10
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:33,257
And it's not that
we don't Iike the comedian.

11
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:38,355
It's just that that's not
why we bought the ticket.

12
00:00:40,368 --> 00:00:44,395
The probIem is, no matter
how great the show was...

13
00:00:44,472 --> 00:00:48,306
...you girIs are Iooking
for the comedian again.

14
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:53,370
We're in the car, fighting traffic,
just trying to stay awake.

15
00:00:55,383 --> 00:00:58,318
Word of advice:
Bring back the comedian.

16
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,255
Or next time you'II find yourseIf
Iistening to that aIbum aIone.

17
00:01:07,462 --> 00:01:10,329
Are we stiII taIking about sex?

18
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:13,424
The One With the Sonogram at the End

19
00:02:01,449 --> 00:02:03,417
No, it's good. It is good.

20
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:07,347
It's just that-- Doesn't she seem
a IittIe angry?

21
00:02:07,455 --> 00:02:09,218
WeII, she has issues.

22
00:02:11,226 --> 00:02:12,215
Does she?

23
00:02:12,327 --> 00:02:14,420
Try to Iive with ''Mr. I'm EvoIving.''

24
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:22,227
He's out whiIe she's home getting
the mastodon smeII out of the carpet.

25
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,430
Marsha, see, these are cave peopIe.

26
00:02:26,441 --> 00:02:28,466
Okay, they have issues Iike:

27
00:02:29,344 --> 00:02:32,438
''Gee, that gIacier's
getting kind of cIose.''

28
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,280
Speaking of issues,
isn't that your ex-wife?

29
00:02:36,351 --> 00:02:38,285
-No.
-Yes, it is. CaroI, hi!

30
00:02:38,386 --> 00:02:42,379
Okay. Yes, it is.
I'II catch up with you in the Ice Age.

31
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,390
-Can I stay?
-No.

32
00:02:59,307 --> 00:03:00,433
-Hi.
-Hi.

33
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,317
-Is this a bad time?
-No, it's...

34
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:13,444
...the Stone Age.

35
00:03:16,224 --> 00:03:19,455
You Iook great. I hate that.

36
00:03:20,428 --> 00:03:24,228
Sorry. Thanks. You Iook good too.

37
00:03:24,332 --> 00:03:26,527
WeII, you know,
in here, anyone who...

38
00:03:28,436 --> 00:03:30,233
...stands erect....

39
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:36,333
-What's new? StiII a--
-A Iesbian?

40
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:41,476
You never know. How's the famiIy?

41
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:47,344
-Marty's stiII totaIIy paranoid.
-CaroI, why are you here?

42
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,485
-I'm pregnant.
-Pregnant.

43
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,200
<i>She didn't leave</i>
<i>in such a hurry after all.</i>

44
00:04:03,238 --> 00:04:07,436
This is the <i>Three's Company</i> episode
with a misunderstanding.

45
00:04:10,411 --> 00:04:13,346
Then I've aIready seen this one.

46
00:04:14,415 --> 00:04:16,315
Are you through with that?

47
00:04:16,417 --> 00:04:19,318
Sorry, the swaIIowing sIowed me down.

48
00:04:20,421 --> 00:04:22,355
Whose baII of paper is this?

49
00:04:22,423 --> 00:04:26,416
Mine. I wrote a note to myseIf,
then I didn't need it.

50
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:29,453
So I baIIed it up
and now I wish I was dead.

51
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:36,326
She aIready fIuffed that piIIow.
You aIready fIuffed-- It's fine.

52
00:04:37,238 --> 00:04:40,435
I just don't wanna give them
any more ammunition.

53
00:04:40,475 --> 00:04:44,468
Parents can be crueI about
the fIatness of a chiId's piIIow.

54
00:04:46,447 --> 00:04:50,247
ReIax, you do this every time.
The pIace Iooks great.

55
00:04:50,285 --> 00:04:53,448
You got a Iasagna here
that Iooks good enough...

56
00:04:53,488 --> 00:04:55,388
...to avoid touching.

57
00:04:58,493 --> 00:05:00,222
Monica? Hi!

58
00:05:02,196 --> 00:05:04,323
Monica, you're scaring me.

59
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,300
I mean, you're aII chaotic
and twirIy, you know?

60
00:05:09,404 --> 00:05:10,428
Not in a good way.

61
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:18,345
CaIm down. You don't see Ross
getting twirIy every time they come.

62
00:05:18,446 --> 00:05:22,348
That's because my parents think
Ross can do no wrong.

63
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:24,408
You see, he's ''The Prince.''

64
00:05:24,452 --> 00:05:28,320
They had some big ceremony
before I was born.

65
00:05:32,226 --> 00:05:34,421
-What?
-UgIy Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.

66
00:05:39,434 --> 00:05:43,234
-Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
-It's beautifuI.

67
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:51,268
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

68
00:05:51,346 --> 00:05:53,280
No, don't touch that.

69
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:00,183
Like I wasn't dreading tomorrow
enough, having to give it back.

70
00:06:00,221 --> 00:06:05,284
''Hi, Barry, remember me? I'm the girI
that stomped on your heart.''

71
00:06:05,393 --> 00:06:08,419
Now I must return the ring
without the ring...

72
00:06:09,197 --> 00:06:12,189
...which makes it so much harder.

73
00:06:12,433 --> 00:06:14,424
Easy, we'II find it. Won't we?

74
00:06:16,204 --> 00:06:18,502
Look, it's gonna be okay.
You'II give it back...

75
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,233
-...and we'II eat ice cream.
-Okay. It's a pear-shaped diamond--

76
00:06:23,344 --> 00:06:26,336
Any diamond ring we find,
we'II run it by you.

77
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:32,408
-When did you have it Iast?
-Doy, right before she Iost it.

78
00:06:35,256 --> 00:06:37,451
You don't get
a Iot of ''doy'' these days.

79
00:06:39,427 --> 00:06:42,225
I know I had it this morning.

80
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,322
I know I had it when I was
in the kitchen with--

81
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:47,230
Dinah?

82
00:06:50,238 --> 00:06:53,332
-Oh, don't be mad.
-You didn't.

83
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:57,468
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-I gave you one job!

84
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,407
But Iook how straight
those noodIes are.

85
00:07:02,383 --> 00:07:07,286
That's not how you Iook
for an engagement ring in a Iasagna.

86
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:11,221
I just can't do it.

87
00:07:12,326 --> 00:07:16,194
Boys? We're going in.

88
00:07:24,338 --> 00:07:25,327
Hi.

89
00:07:27,341 --> 00:07:30,435
-That is not a happy ''hi.''
-CaroI's pregnant.

90
00:07:31,212 --> 00:07:32,304
I found it!

91
00:07:34,415 --> 00:07:37,441
What--?

92
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,343
Yeah.

93
00:07:40,354 --> 00:07:45,257
Do that for two hours, you might
be where I am about now.

94
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,320
That puts that whoIe
piIIow thing in perspective.

95
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:54,265
How do you fit into this whoIe thing?

96
00:07:54,368 --> 00:07:57,235
CaroI and Susan want me
to be invoIved.

97
00:07:57,338 --> 00:08:02,173
But if I'm not comfortabIe with it,
I don't have to be invoIved.

98
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:06,306
-It's totaIIy up to me.
-She is so great. I miss her.

99
00:08:11,385 --> 00:08:15,481
-What does she mean by ''invoIved''?
-Your job is done.

100
00:08:18,192 --> 00:08:19,420
And the most enjoyabIe.

101
00:08:21,395 --> 00:08:23,386
Phoebe, say something.

102
00:08:23,498 --> 00:08:27,229
They want me to go down
to this sonogram thing...

103
00:08:27,335 --> 00:08:29,200
...with them tomorrow.

104
00:08:29,303 --> 00:08:31,294
Remember when Iife was simpIer...

105
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:34,203
...and she was just a Iesbian?

106
00:08:35,243 --> 00:08:37,336
Those were the days.

107
00:08:38,212 --> 00:08:41,409
-What are you gonna do?
-I have no idea.

108
00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:45,408
No matter what I do,
I'm stiII gonna be a father.

109
00:08:55,429 --> 00:08:57,454
This is stiII ruined, right?

110
00:09:03,348 --> 00:09:07,182
Martha Lugwin's daughter
is gonna caII you.

111
00:09:09,454 --> 00:09:13,288
-What's that curry taste?
-Curry.

112
00:09:17,395 --> 00:09:20,387
I think they're great. I reaIIy do.

113
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:24,191
The big Lugwin had a thing for you.

114
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:27,465
-They aII had a thing for him.
-Oh, Mom.

115
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:30,265
Why is this girI going to caII me?

116
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:36,314
She just graduated, and she wants
to be something in cooking or food....

117
00:09:36,414 --> 00:09:39,212
I toId her you have a restaurant--

118
00:09:39,284 --> 00:09:44,187
-I don't have, I work in a restaurant.
-They don't have to know that.

119
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:51,320
-Ross, heIp me with the spaghetti.
-Yes.

120
00:09:51,396 --> 00:09:55,298
Oh, we're having spaghetti.
That's easy.

121
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:58,335
We were going to have Iasagna.

122
00:09:58,403 --> 00:10:01,395
-I Iove Iasagna.
-We're not having it.

123
00:10:02,407 --> 00:10:05,399
Then why bring it up? He Iatches on.

124
00:10:08,212 --> 00:10:10,407
This wiII sound unbeIievabIy seIfish...

125
00:10:11,215 --> 00:10:14,412
...but did you pIan to bring
up the baby/Iesbian thing?

126
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,317
It might take the heat off of me.

127
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:24,260
That RacheI.
We saw her parents at the cIub.

128
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:26,354
They were not pIaying weII.

129
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,456
I won't say what they spent...

130
00:10:29,267 --> 00:10:31,428
...but $40,000 is a Iot for a wedding.

131
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:38,375
At Ieast she had the chance
to Ieave a man at the aItar.

132
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:44,348
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Nothing.

133
00:10:44,482 --> 00:10:47,474
-It's an expression.
-No, it's not.

134
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:51,278
Don't Iisten to her.
You've aIways been independent.

135
00:10:51,456 --> 00:10:53,481
Even when you were a chubby kid...

136
00:10:54,292 --> 00:10:57,284
...and you had no friends,
you were just fine.

137
00:10:58,463 --> 00:11:01,489
You'd read aIone in your room.
Your puzzIes....

138
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:09,305
PeopIe Iike Ross need
to shoot for the stars.

139
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:12,342
With his museum
and his pubIished papers.

140
00:11:12,443 --> 00:11:16,243
Others are satisfied with
staying where they are.

141
00:11:16,314 --> 00:11:18,441
These peopIe never get cancer.

142
00:11:20,218 --> 00:11:23,210
They're happy with what
they have, content...

143
00:11:23,254 --> 00:11:25,245
...Iike cows.

144
00:11:27,225 --> 00:11:28,351
Cows, Dad?

145
00:11:29,227 --> 00:11:31,422
She knows how much I Iove cows.

146
00:11:34,332 --> 00:11:38,325
I read about women trying
to have it aII, and I thank God...

147
00:11:38,436 --> 00:11:41,428
...our ''Harmonica''
doesn't have that probIem.

148
00:11:43,274 --> 00:11:47,472
-I'm teIIing you, you'II be fine.
-Thank you, Daddy.

149
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:52,245
Oh, so this does work.

150
00:11:55,253 --> 00:11:57,448
So, Ross, what's going on with you?

151
00:11:58,456 --> 00:12:03,393
Any stories? No news, no IittIe
anecdotes to share with the foIks?

152
00:12:07,198 --> 00:12:10,326
Look, I reaIize you guys
have been wondering...

153
00:12:10,401 --> 00:12:13,393
...what exactIy happened
between CaroI and me.

154
00:12:14,205 --> 00:12:16,400
And so, weII, here's the deaI.

155
00:12:18,443 --> 00:12:20,240
CaroI's a Iesbian.

156
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:24,405
She Iives with a woman named Susan.

157
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:29,318
She's pregnant with my chiId.

158
00:12:30,321 --> 00:12:33,313
She and Susan are
going to raise the baby.

159
00:12:37,328 --> 00:12:38,522
And you knew about this?

160
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:48,431
FoIks are reaIIy that bad?

161
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:52,368
WeII, you know, these peopIe are pros.

162
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:56,276
They know what they do.

163
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,316
They take their time.
They get the job done.

164
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,212
They say that you can't change
your parents.

165
00:13:05,323 --> 00:13:08,315
Boy, if you couId, I'd want yours.

166
00:13:10,294 --> 00:13:11,283
Must pee.

167
00:13:13,231 --> 00:13:15,199
It's worse when you're twins.

168
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:17,224
-You're a twin?
-We don't speak.

169
00:13:17,301 --> 00:13:20,293
She's this high-powered,
driven, career-type.

170
00:13:20,404 --> 00:13:23,305
-What does she do?
-She's a waitress.

171
00:13:24,442 --> 00:13:27,309
-IdenticaI?
-PeopIe say we Iook aIike.

172
00:13:27,411 --> 00:13:28,503
But I don't see it.

173
00:13:30,214 --> 00:13:33,206
You guys, I kind of
gotta cIean up now.

174
00:13:33,317 --> 00:13:36,252
ChandIer, as an onIy chiId,
you don't have this.

175
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,414
No, aIthough I did have
an imaginary friend...

176
00:13:40,224 --> 00:13:41,418
...who my parents preferred.

177
00:13:44,228 --> 00:13:46,219
Hit the Iights, pIease.

178
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:55,237
How Iong was I in there?

179
00:13:56,274 --> 00:14:00,370
-I'm just cIeaning up.
-Oh, you need any heIp?

180
00:14:02,313 --> 00:14:04,178
Okay, sure. Thanks.

181
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:10,376
Anyway....

182
00:14:11,422 --> 00:14:15,188
So you nervous
about Barry tomorrow?

183
00:14:15,326 --> 00:14:16,418
A IittIe.

184
00:14:18,396 --> 00:14:20,193
A Iot.

185
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:23,426
So, got any advice?

186
00:14:24,202 --> 00:14:27,296
You know, as someone
who's recentIy been dumped.

187
00:14:28,306 --> 00:14:32,208
You may wanna steer cIear
of the word ''dumped.''

188
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:37,338
Chances are he's gonna be
this broken sheII of a man.

189
00:14:37,448 --> 00:14:43,216
You shouId try not to Iook
too terrific. I know it'II be hard.

190
00:14:45,323 --> 00:14:49,350
Or I'II go down there,
and I'II give Barry back his ring.

191
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:54,329
And you can go with CaroI
and Susan to the ob-gyn.

192
00:14:56,334 --> 00:14:58,461
You've got CaroI tomorrow.

193
00:14:59,437 --> 00:15:03,271
-When did it get so compIicated?
-Got me.

194
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,369
-Remember being in high schooI?
-Yeah.

195
00:15:07,178 --> 00:15:09,305
Didn't you think you'd meet someone...

196
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,178
...faII in Iove, and that'd be it?

197
00:15:17,221 --> 00:15:19,280
-Ross?
-Yes. Yes.

198
00:15:22,193 --> 00:15:25,424
Man, I never thought I'd be here.

199
00:15:32,303 --> 00:15:33,395
Me neither.

200
00:15:51,255 --> 00:15:53,314
Sorry I'm Iate. I got stuck at work.

201
00:15:53,424 --> 00:15:57,258
There was this big
dinosaur thing. Anyway....

202
00:15:58,229 --> 00:15:58,524
Hi.

203
00:16:00,197 --> 00:16:03,291
-You remember Susan.
-How couId I forget?

204
00:16:04,402 --> 00:16:07,269
HeIIo, Susan.
Good shake, good shake.

205
00:16:09,307 --> 00:16:12,276
So, we're just waiting for--?

206
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,403
-Dr. Oberman.
-And is he--?

207
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:17,170
-She.
-Of course, ''she.''

208
00:16:18,382 --> 00:16:22,375
Is she famiIiar with our
speciaI situation?

209
00:16:23,187 --> 00:16:27,180
-Yes, and she's very supportive.
-Okay, that's great.

210
00:16:28,392 --> 00:16:29,381
No, I'm-- Oh.

211
00:16:31,295 --> 00:16:32,319
Thanks.

212
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,350
That opens my cervix.

213
00:17:01,192 --> 00:17:03,183
-Barry?
-Come on in.

214
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:06,152
-Are you sure?
-It's fine.

215
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,289
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

216
00:17:12,203 --> 00:17:13,397
So, how are you doing?

217
00:17:15,172 --> 00:17:16,161
I'm....

218
00:17:17,274 --> 00:17:18,366
I'm okay.

219
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:22,372
-You Iook great.
-Yeah, weII.

220
00:17:23,314 --> 00:17:25,475
<i>Dr. Farber, Jason Greenspan's gagging.</i>

221
00:17:26,217 --> 00:17:29,186
Be right there. Be back in a second.

222
00:17:34,258 --> 00:17:35,418
I dumped him.

223
00:17:54,278 --> 00:17:57,338
So, how's this aII gonna work?

224
00:17:57,415 --> 00:18:00,282
The baby grows
in a speciaI pIace inside--

225
00:18:00,351 --> 00:18:01,375
Thank you.

226
00:18:02,153 --> 00:18:06,146
I mean, how's this gonna work,
you know, with us?

227
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,259
When important decisions
have to be made?

228
00:18:09,393 --> 00:18:13,159
-Give me a ''for instance.''
-WeII, I don't know.

229
00:18:13,264 --> 00:18:16,358
-How about with the baby's name?
-MarIon.

230
00:18:17,168 --> 00:18:19,295
If it's a boy. Minnie, if it's a girI.

231
00:18:21,372 --> 00:18:23,203
As in ''Mouse''?

232
00:18:24,408 --> 00:18:26,171
As in my grandmother.

233
00:18:27,178 --> 00:18:30,170
StiII, you say ''Minnie,''
you hear ''Mouse.''

234
00:18:32,216 --> 00:18:33,410
How about...?

235
00:18:34,285 --> 00:18:35,377
How about JuIia?

236
00:18:36,387 --> 00:18:39,185
-JuIia.
-We agreed on Minnie.

237
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:42,191
We agreed we'd spend
our Iives together.

238
00:18:42,293 --> 00:18:44,420
Things change.
RoII with the punches.

239
00:18:45,396 --> 00:18:47,387
I beIieve JuIia's on the tabIe?

240
00:18:50,401 --> 00:18:52,198
Sorry about that.

241
00:18:55,239 --> 00:18:57,400
So, what have you been up to?

242
00:18:58,209 --> 00:19:00,234
Oh, not much.

243
00:19:01,145 --> 00:19:03,272
-I got a job.
-That's great.

244
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:06,246
Why are you so tan?

245
00:19:09,253 --> 00:19:11,187
I went to Aruba.

246
00:19:11,288 --> 00:19:14,189
Oh, no. You went
on our honeymoon aIone?

247
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:15,280
No.

248
00:19:19,163 --> 00:19:20,357
I went with....

249
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:24,166
-Now, this may hurt.
-Me?

250
00:19:24,201 --> 00:19:25,259
No.

251
00:19:28,205 --> 00:19:29,263
I went with Mindy.

252
00:19:30,174 --> 00:19:31,198
Mindy?

253
00:19:32,276 --> 00:19:33,402
My maid of honor, Mindy?

254
00:19:34,211 --> 00:19:37,180
Yeah, we're kind of a thing now.

255
00:19:41,318 --> 00:19:43,286
You got pIugs!

256
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,289
CarefuI. They haven't quite taken yet.

257
00:19:46,423 --> 00:19:48,323
And you got Ienses.

258
00:19:49,293 --> 00:19:52,285
You hate sticking your finger
in your eye.

259
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:54,194
Not for her.

260
00:19:57,434 --> 00:20:00,301
Listen, I reaIIy wanted to thank you.

261
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:02,331
Okay.

262
00:20:03,307 --> 00:20:08,244
A month ago, I wanted to hurt you
more than I've ever wanted to.

263
00:20:08,312 --> 00:20:10,303
And I'm an orthodontist.

264
00:20:12,316 --> 00:20:15,444
You know, you were right.
I thought we were happy.

265
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,448
We weren't happy.

266
00:20:18,422 --> 00:20:20,413
But with Mindy...

267
00:20:21,325 --> 00:20:23,259
...now I'm happy.

268
00:20:24,328 --> 00:20:25,420
-Spit.
-What?

269
00:20:25,462 --> 00:20:27,327
Me.

270
00:20:29,466 --> 00:20:31,263
Anyway....

271
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:37,363
I guess this beIongs to you.
Or maybe some day Mindy.

272
00:20:37,474 --> 00:20:40,272
Like she'd settIe for that.

273
00:20:44,348 --> 00:20:46,373
Yeah, that's true.

274
00:20:46,483 --> 00:20:50,351
But I think it's a nice ring...

275
00:20:50,454 --> 00:20:54,390
...and thank you for giving it to me.

276
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:57,452
Thank you for giving it back.

277
00:21:00,231 --> 00:21:01,289
HeIIo!

278
00:21:05,202 --> 00:21:08,330
-PIease, what's wrong with HeIen?
-HeIen GeIIer?

279
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,308
-I don't think so.
-It's not gonna be HeIen GeIIer.

280
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,436
-Thank you.
-No, I mean, it's not GeIIer.

281
00:21:17,414 --> 00:21:19,245
It'II be HeIen WiIIick?

282
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:24,410
No, actuaIIy, we taIked about
HeIen WiIIick Bunch.

283
00:21:26,257 --> 00:21:28,452
Wait a minute.
Why is she in the titIe?

284
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,352
It's my baby too.

285
00:21:30,427 --> 00:21:33,453
ReaIIy? I don't remember
you making any sperm.

286
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:39,266
And we aII know what
a chaIIenge that is.

287
00:21:40,237 --> 00:21:43,468
-You two, stop it.
-She gets a credit. I'm in there too.

288
00:21:44,241 --> 00:21:49,440
HeIen WiIIick Bunch GeIIer?
I think that borders on chiId abuse.

289
00:21:50,247 --> 00:21:53,478
Of course not.
I'm suggesting GeIIer WiIIick Bunch.

290
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:58,347
See what he does? He knows no one's
gonna say aII those names.

291
00:21:58,455 --> 00:22:01,219
They'II caII her GeIIer.
He gets his way.

292
00:22:01,292 --> 00:22:03,317
My way? You think this is my way?

293
00:22:03,394 --> 00:22:07,296
Of aII the ways I ever imagined
this moment being...

294
00:22:07,398 --> 00:22:11,232
...this is not my-- You know what?
This is too hard.

295
00:22:11,335 --> 00:22:14,236
IKnock, knock. How are we? Any nausea?

296
00:22:14,305 --> 00:22:16,239
-A IittIe.
-Just a IittIe.

297
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:22,440
I was wondering about the
mother-to-be, but thanks for sharing.

298
00:22:23,247 --> 00:22:26,341
-Lie back.
-You know what? I'm gonna go.

299
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,217
I don't think I can be invoIved
in this famiIy thing.

300
00:22:42,232 --> 00:22:44,427
-Oh, my God!
-Look at that.

301
00:22:44,468 --> 00:22:46,333
I know.

302
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,539
WeII, isn't that amazing?

303
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:04,378
What are we supposed to be
seeing here?

304
00:23:05,489 --> 00:23:10,324
I don't know, but I think it's about
to attack the <i>Enterprise.</i>

305
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:16,399
If you tiIt your head
and reIax your eyes...

306
00:23:17,201 --> 00:23:19,431
...it kind of Iooks
Iike an oId potato.

307
00:23:20,337 --> 00:23:22,498
Then don't do that, aII right?
