1
00:00:57,431 --> 00:00:59,228
No, no, we're done!

2
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:03,394
The One With the Dozen Lasagnas

3
00:01:47,415 --> 00:01:50,213
Aunt Silv, stop yelling!

4
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:53,252
lf you'd told me
vegetarian lasagna...

5
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,447
...l would've made
vegetarian lasagna.

6
00:01:57,324 --> 00:02:00,452
The meat's only every third layer.
Maybe you could scrape.

7
00:02:01,462 --> 00:02:04,397
Ross, did you really read
all these baby boolks?

8
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:09,192
You could plunlk me down in
any woman's uterus, no compass...

9
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,332
...and l could find my way
out lilke that!

10
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,364
This is cool.

11
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:19,272
lt says in some parts of the world
people eat the placenta.

12
00:02:21,215 --> 00:02:23,274
And we're done with the yogurt.

13
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,175
Sorry.

14
00:02:26,387 --> 00:02:30,187
l did this as a favor.
l am not a caterer.

15
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:33,385
What do you want me to do
with a dozen lasagnas?

16
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:36,388
Nice tallk, Aunt Silv.

17
00:02:37,298 --> 00:02:39,425
You lkiss Uncle Freddie
with that mouth?

18
00:02:40,434 --> 00:02:45,428
Ross, listen. Do you lknow that right
now your baby is only this big?

19
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,198
This is your baby.
''Hi, Daddy.''

20
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:49,398
Hello.

21
00:02:50,244 --> 00:02:53,213
''How come you don't live with Mommy?''

22
00:02:54,415 --> 00:02:57,407
''How come Mommy lives
with that other lady?''

23
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:04,280
''What's a lesbian?''

24
00:03:09,296 --> 00:03:11,355
Honey, you can say it. Poconos.

25
00:03:11,465 --> 00:03:16,266
Poconos. lt's lilke ''polke a nose.''

26
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:21,264
Polke a nose.

27
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:32,216
-So did l hear Poconos?
-Yes.

28
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,379
My sister's giving us her place
for the weelkend.

29
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,384
First weelkend together.

30
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:40,222
-lt's a big step.
-l lknow.

31
00:03:41,228 --> 00:03:45,324
-lt's just a weelkend. Big deal.
-Wasn't this supposed to be a fling?

32
00:03:45,499 --> 00:03:47,296
Shouldn't it be...

33
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:49,334
...flung by now?

34
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:52,295
We are way past a ''fling.''

35
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:56,399
l'm feeling things l've read about
in Danielle Steel boolks.

36
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:59,411
When l'm with him,
l'm just totally....

37
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:02,342
Nauseous.
l'm physically nauseous.

38
00:04:03,384 --> 00:04:07,184
What am l supposed to do?
Call lmmigration?

39
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:09,451
l could call lmmigration.

40
00:04:15,162 --> 00:04:16,254
What?

41
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,199
Ugly Nalked Guy is malking
shadow puppets.

42
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:23,466
Loolk, it's Abraham Lincoln.

43
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,398
Oh, right!

44
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,369
Go. Go!

45
00:04:35,182 --> 00:04:38,310
l love babies with
their little baby shoes...

46
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:42,412
...and their little baby toes
and their little hands....

47
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,318
Olkay, you're gonna have to stop that.
Forever.

48
00:04:56,403 --> 00:04:58,200
Need a new table.

49
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:00,168
You thinlk?

50
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:09,272
-Come on in.
-Hello.

51
00:05:09,383 --> 00:05:11,248
l brought the boolks...

52
00:05:11,385 --> 00:05:15,185
...and Monica sends her love
along with this lasagna.

53
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:19,249
Great! ls it vegetarian?
Because Susan doesn't eat meat.

54
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:23,354
l'm pretty sure that it is.

55
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:32,171
Nineteen weelks, the breasts
are starting to swell.

56
00:05:33,274 --> 00:05:35,299
According to the literature.

57
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:39,278
-l got the results of the amnio.
-Tell me. ls everything...?

58
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,373
-Totally and completely healthy.
-That is great!

59
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:51,384
When did you and Susan
meet Huey Lewis?

60
00:05:52,192 --> 00:05:54,183
That's our friend Tanya.

61
00:06:03,337 --> 00:06:06,135
Of course, it's your friend Tanya.

62
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:12,178
-Don't you wanna lknow about the sex?
-The sex?

63
00:06:13,347 --> 00:06:18,148
l'm having enough trouble with
the image of you and Susan together.

64
00:06:18,185 --> 00:06:20,244
But when you throw in Tanya....

65
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,283
The sex of the baby, Ross.

66
00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:29,352
You lknow the sex of the baby?

67
00:06:31,198 --> 00:06:32,358
-Want to lknow?
-No.

68
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,192
l don't want to. Absolutely not.

69
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:38,261
You shouldn't lknow until
you loolk down there...

70
00:06:38,372 --> 00:06:40,306
...and see, ''Oh, there it is.''

71
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,368
Or isn't.

72
00:06:45,312 --> 00:06:47,405
-Hello, Ross.
-Susan.

73
00:06:48,215 --> 00:06:49,182
So?

74
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,179
So did you hear?

75
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,276
Yes, we did.
Everything's A-Olkay.

76
00:06:53,387 --> 00:06:56,185
Oh, that's so cool!

77
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,383
lt really is.

78
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:00,158
Do we lknow?

79
00:07:00,327 --> 00:07:03,262
We certainly do.
lt's going to be a--

80
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,319
Hello?

81
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:08,265
A guy who doesn't wanna lknow
is standing here.

82
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,362
Well, is it what
we thought it would be?

83
00:07:19,346 --> 00:07:21,177
What--?

84
00:07:21,348 --> 00:07:23,282
What did we thinlk it'd be?

85
00:07:24,251 --> 00:07:26,378
l don't wanna lknow.
Don't wanna lknow.

86
00:07:27,187 --> 00:07:28,381
l should probably just go.

87
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:32,384
-Well, thanlks for the boolks.
-No problem. Olkay.

88
00:07:36,163 --> 00:07:37,187
Susan.

89
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:47,170
Who should we call first?
Your follks or Deb and Rhona?

90
00:07:50,477 --> 00:07:52,206
Hello?

91
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:56,306
<i>Never mind.</i>
<i>I don't wanna know.</i>

92
00:07:57,384 --> 00:08:01,150
Because it was my table,
l have to buy a new one?

93
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:05,157
-That's the rule.
-What rule? There's no rule.

94
00:08:05,225 --> 00:08:08,353
-You owe me a table.
-How did you get there?

95
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:14,123
lt was fine until your brealkfast
adventure with Angela Delvecio.

96
00:08:14,268 --> 00:08:16,133
You lknew about that?

97
00:08:16,236 --> 00:08:20,263
The impressions in the butter
left little to the imagination.

98
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:23,175
How about if we split it?

99
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:27,170
-What do you mean, buy it together?
-Yeah.

100
00:08:27,347 --> 00:08:31,374
-Do you thinlk we're ready for that?
-Why not?

101
00:08:32,152 --> 00:08:36,145
lt's a big commitment.
What if one of us wants to move out?

102
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,181
-You're moving out?
-l'm not.

103
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:40,385
-You'd tell me if you were, right?
-Yes.

104
00:08:41,161 --> 00:08:45,291
-lt's just, with my last roommate--
-l lknow all about Kip.

105
00:08:45,365 --> 00:08:50,359
We bought a hibachi, then he ran off
and got married. Things got ugly.

106
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:55,369
Let me aslk you something.
Was Kip a better roommate than me?

107
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:57,404
Oh, don't do that.

108
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,114
There's changes in your schedule.

109
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:09,213
Your 4:00 herbal massage is at 4:0.

110
00:09:09,256 --> 00:09:12,248
And Miss Summerfield
canceled her 5:0 shiatsu.

111
00:09:12,359 --> 00:09:13,348
Thanlks.

112
00:09:14,228 --> 00:09:16,128
Oh, here comes your :00.

113
00:09:16,263 --> 00:09:20,165
l don't mean to sound unprofessional,
but-- Yum!

114
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:27,230
Paolo! Hi! What are you doing here?

115
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:32,337
Rachella tell me you...

116
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,247
...massage?

117
00:09:35,148 --> 00:09:37,173
Well, Rachella's right.

118
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:43,179
Oh, olkay.

119
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,350
l don't lknow what you just said,
so let's start.

120
00:09:48,262 --> 00:09:49,251
l am...

121
00:09:50,264 --> 00:09:52,255
...being nalked?

122
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,267
That's your decision.
Some people prefer to talke off--

123
00:09:58,305 --> 00:09:59,363
Being nalked!

124
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:05,201
l can't believe you don't
wanna lknow. l couldn't not lknow.

125
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,214
lf the doctor lknows,
Carol and Susan lknow--

126
00:10:08,382 --> 00:10:10,179
And Monica lknows.

127
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:13,183
How? l don't even lknow.

128
00:10:13,287 --> 00:10:16,381
Carol called to thanlk me
for the lasagna. She told me.

129
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,418
So what's it gonna be?

130
00:10:22,195 --> 00:10:26,325
-Oh, great! Now he lknows.
-l'm just excited about being an aunt.

131
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,233
Or an uncle.

132
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,399
-Hey, Phoebe.
-Hey, Pheebs.

133
00:10:35,442 --> 00:10:36,431
Fine!

134
00:10:40,213 --> 00:10:43,410
-What's the matter?
-Nothing. l'm just out of sorts.

135
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:47,419
Well, you can use some of my sorts.
l rarely use them.

136
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:50,348
Can we get some cappuccino
over here?

137
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:53,419
Oh, right! That's me!

138
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:58,321
That table place closes at 7. Come on.

139
00:10:58,432 --> 00:10:59,456
Fine.

140
00:11:01,368 --> 00:11:02,392
What is it?

141
00:11:04,204 --> 00:11:08,163
-All right. You lknow Paolo?
-l'm familiar with his worlk.

142
00:11:09,276 --> 00:11:11,176
He made a move on me.

143
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:14,406
-The store will be open tomorrow.
-More coffee, please.

144
00:11:16,383 --> 00:11:18,180
Well, what happened?

145
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:22,278
He came in for a massage,
and everything was fine until....

146
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:28,327
-Oh, my God.
-Are you sure?

147
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:32,221
Oh, yeah. l'm sure.

148
00:11:36,203 --> 00:11:40,196
And all of a sudden, his hands
weren't the problem anymore.

149
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:45,300
Was it...?

150
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:48,404
Boy Scouts could've camped
under there.

151
00:11:52,352 --> 00:11:53,341
Wow.

152
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:57,321
-What did you do?
-l dealt with it lilke a professional.

153
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:05,262
''Ooh,'' what?

154
00:12:05,365 --> 00:12:06,354
--ma Thurman.

155
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:09,162
-The actress!
-Uma Thurman!

156
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,259
Thanlks, Rach.

157
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:16,367
-What'll you do?
-You have to tell her.

158
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:21,313
lt's your moral obligation as a friend,
as a woman. lt's a feminist issue.

159
00:12:21,381 --> 00:12:22,370
Guys?

160
00:12:23,183 --> 00:12:26,277
-You have to.
-Feminist issue? That's where l went.

161
00:12:28,321 --> 00:12:31,290
-She is gonna hate me!
-Yeah, well....

162
00:12:38,398 --> 00:12:41,196
Will you piclk one?
Just piclk one.

163
00:12:41,234 --> 00:12:45,227
-Here, how about that one?
-That's patio furniture.

164
00:12:45,405 --> 00:12:50,240
So what? Lilke people will come in
and thinlk, ''Oh, l'm outside again.''

165
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,299
Fine.

166
00:12:52,212 --> 00:12:53,338
What about the birds?

167
00:12:54,514 --> 00:12:59,417
l don't lknow. They don't say,
''Hello, sit here. Eat something.''

168
00:13:00,387 --> 00:13:03,379
-You piclk one.
-Olkay. How about the ladybugs?

169
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:08,252
Forget about the birds, but big red
insects suggest fine dining.

170
00:13:08,361 --> 00:13:12,457
-Fine! Want the birds? Get the birds!
-Not lilke that, l won't.

171
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:18,262
Kip would have lilked the birds.

172
00:13:29,216 --> 00:13:31,207
-Hi, Pheebs.
-What's going on?

173
00:13:31,284 --> 00:13:35,186
-Are you moving out?
-l'm getting ready for the weelkend.

174
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:39,290
Are your weelkends longer
than two days?

175
00:13:40,227 --> 00:13:42,195
These aren't all my suitcases.

176
00:13:42,295 --> 00:13:43,387
This one's Paolo's.

177
00:13:47,234 --> 00:13:51,193
-Rachel, can we tallk for a sec?
-Well, sure.

178
00:13:51,238 --> 00:13:53,399
Just for a sec, Paolo's on his way.

179
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:08,348
We haven't lknown each other that long.

180
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:11,289
There are three things
you should lknow:

181
00:14:11,391 --> 00:14:16,192
One, my friends are the most
important thing in my life.

182
00:14:16,296 --> 00:14:18,264
Two, l never lie.

183
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,260
And three, l malke the best
oatmeal raisin coolkies in the world.

184
00:14:25,372 --> 00:14:28,307
Olkay. Thanlks, Pheebs.

185
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,213
-Oh, my God!
-l lknow.

186
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:38,375
Why have l never tasted these?

187
00:14:38,418 --> 00:14:43,378
l don't malke them a lot, because
it's not fair to the other coolkies.

188
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:52,421
These are the best
oatmeal raisin coolkies.

189
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:56,396
-Which proves that l never lie.
-l guess you don't.

190
00:14:57,304 --> 00:14:59,397
Paolo made a pass at me.

191
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:03,234
What do you thinlk?

192
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:06,245
lt's the most beautiful table
l've seen.

193
00:15:06,346 --> 00:15:07,335
l lknow.

194
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:10,343
Will you balance plates
on these heads?

195
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:13,346
Who cares? We'll eat at the sinlk.
Come on!

196
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:17,248
Heads up, Ross.

197
00:15:17,357 --> 00:15:19,450
Score! You suclk!

198
00:15:23,196 --> 00:15:24,254
Are you olkay?

199
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,392
l need some millk.

200
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,361
Olkay. l've got millk.

201
00:15:37,377 --> 00:15:39,174
Here you go.

202
00:15:47,387 --> 00:15:49,184
Better?

203
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,414
No.

204
00:15:54,294 --> 00:15:59,391
l feel so stupid! l thinlk about
the other day with you guys.

205
00:15:59,432 --> 00:16:03,232
And l was all, ''Oh, Paolo!
He's so great!

206
00:16:03,336 --> 00:16:05,236
He malkes me feel so--''

207
00:16:06,172 --> 00:16:07,230
God!

208
00:16:08,141 --> 00:16:09,267
l'm so embarrassed!

209
00:16:09,376 --> 00:16:11,241
l'm so embarrassed.

210
00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:15,144
-l'm the one he hit on.
-l unleashed him on you.

211
00:16:15,181 --> 00:16:17,149
lf l had never met him--

212
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,241
-l'm so sorry.
-No, l'm sorry.

213
00:16:19,352 --> 00:16:21,377
-l'm sorry.
-l'm sorry. Wait.

214
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:24,349
-What are we sorry about?
-l don't lknow.

215
00:16:24,457 --> 00:16:26,391
Right. He's the pig.

216
00:16:27,193 --> 00:16:29,388
-Such a pig!
-Oh, God, he's such a pig!

217
00:16:30,163 --> 00:16:33,291
He's lilke a big disgusting pig....

218
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,164
-Pig man!
-Yes, good!

219
00:16:40,273 --> 00:16:43,265
But he was my pig man!

220
00:16:44,377 --> 00:16:46,368
How did l not see this?

221
00:16:48,281 --> 00:16:49,305
Oh, l lknow!

222
00:16:52,385 --> 00:16:53,409
Because...

223
00:16:54,387 --> 00:16:56,184
...he's gorgeous.

224
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:57,415
And he's charming.

225
00:16:58,224 --> 00:17:00,351
-And when he loolks--
-Olkay, Pheebs.

226
00:17:01,127 --> 00:17:02,253
The end.

227
00:17:05,131 --> 00:17:06,120
God.

228
00:17:08,134 --> 00:17:10,125
Should l not have told you?

229
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:14,170
Trust me, it's much better
that l lknow.

230
00:17:17,277 --> 00:17:21,236
But l just lilked it better before.
lt was better.

231
00:17:38,198 --> 00:17:42,157
She toolk it pretty well.
Paolo's over there now, so....

232
00:17:42,302 --> 00:17:46,363
We should go and see if she's olkay.
Just one second.

233
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,301
-Score!
-Game! Nice!

234
00:17:52,412 --> 00:17:54,175
Come on, Pheebs.

235
00:17:55,382 --> 00:17:58,374
Well, it loolks lilke we
lkiclked your butts.

236
00:17:58,418 --> 00:18:03,117
She did. You could be on the Olympic
''Standing There'' team.

237
00:18:03,156 --> 00:18:04,248
Come on. Two on one.

238
00:18:04,357 --> 00:18:07,224
Why are you here?
She just brolke up with him.

239
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:09,420
lt's time for you to swoop in.

240
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,231
-What, now?
-Yes. Now is when you swoop.

241
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:17,225
When Paolo wallks out,
you gotta be the first guy she sees.

242
00:18:17,337 --> 00:18:22,240
She's gotta lknow you're everything
he's not. You're the anti-Paolo.

243
00:18:24,177 --> 00:18:26,145
My Catholic friend is right.

244
00:18:26,246 --> 00:18:28,373
She's distraught.
You're there for her.

245
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:34,382
You piclk up the pieces and then
you usher in ''The Age of Ross.''

246
00:18:41,361 --> 00:18:44,262
-See this? See?
-Hold it! <i>Ascolta</i>!

247
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:49,358
-How's it going?
-Don't stare.

248
00:18:49,402 --> 00:18:54,362
She threw his clothes off the balcony.
Now there's gesturing and arm-waving.

249
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:58,303
That is, ''How could you?''
or ''Enormous breasts!''

250
00:19:00,313 --> 00:19:02,213
Here he comes.

251
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:14,122
l am...

252
00:19:14,327 --> 00:19:16,158
...to say goodbye.

253
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:18,160
Olkay, bye-bye.

254
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:27,136
Paolo, l really hate you for what you
did, but l still have five of these...

255
00:19:27,173 --> 00:19:30,142
...so heat it at 75
until the cheese bubbles.

256
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,374
l just wanna tell you, and l thinlk
l'd spealk for everyone when l say....

257
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:48,193
Oh, just loolk at her.

258
00:19:48,294 --> 00:19:50,455
Guys, l thinlk only one of us
should go...

259
00:19:51,197 --> 00:19:53,290
-...so she's not overwhelmed.
-Right.

260
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:56,199
And l really thinlk it should be me.

261
00:20:13,186 --> 00:20:14,278
You all right?

262
00:20:15,288 --> 00:20:17,222
l've been better.

263
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:20,292
l don't believe this.

264
00:20:21,227 --> 00:20:24,219
l wasn't supposed to care
about this guy.

265
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:29,200
lt was just supposed to be
this big, fun, ltalian thing.

266
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:34,395
Someday l could loolk baclk and say,
''That was a big, fun, ltalian thing.''

267
00:20:36,242 --> 00:20:39,439
lt wasn't supposed to feel
lilke this when it was over.

268
00:20:42,315 --> 00:20:43,339
Come here.

269
00:20:50,423 --> 00:20:52,254
Listen...

270
00:20:52,325 --> 00:20:55,317
...you deserve
so much better than him.

271
00:20:55,428 --> 00:20:57,419
l mean, you...

272
00:20:58,231 --> 00:21:02,167
...should be with a guy who lknows
what he has when he has you.

273
00:21:05,405 --> 00:21:06,394
What?

274
00:21:07,407 --> 00:21:10,308
l'm so siclk of guys!

275
00:21:11,277 --> 00:21:15,407
l don't want to loolk at
or thinlk about another guy.

276
00:21:16,216 --> 00:21:19,208
l don't even want
to be near another guy.

277
00:21:26,226 --> 00:21:28,421
Ross, you're so great.

278
00:21:40,306 --> 00:21:42,399
-Are you all right?
-Are you olkay?

279
00:21:43,209 --> 00:21:46,406
-Medium. Any coolkies left?
-Yeah.

280
00:21:49,449 --> 00:21:51,246
See, Rach...

281
00:21:51,317 --> 00:21:55,413
...l don't thinlk swearing off guys
altogether is the answer.

282
00:21:56,222 --> 00:22:00,249
What you need is to develop a more
sophisticated screening process.

283
00:22:02,262 --> 00:22:04,457
l just need to be by myself
for a while.

284
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:08,361
-l just gotta figure out what l want.
-No, no.

285
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:13,305
See, because not all guys out there
are gonna be a Paolo.

286
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,364
No, l lknow. l lknow.

287
00:22:15,408 --> 00:22:20,175
And l'm sure your little boy's
not gonna grow up to be one.

288
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,171
-What?
-What?

289
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,182
l'm having a boy?

290
00:22:28,187 --> 00:22:29,313
No.

291
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:33,384
No. ln fact, you're not having a boy.

292
00:22:34,294 --> 00:22:36,194
l'm having a boy.

293
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:41,299
-Huh? Am l having a boy?
-You're having a boy!

294
00:22:41,434 --> 00:22:43,197
l'm having a boy!

295
00:22:43,303 --> 00:22:45,294
-l'm having a boy!
-What is it?

296
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:48,238
l'm having a boy!
l'm having a boy!

297
00:22:52,211 --> 00:22:53,405
We already lknew that!

298
00:22:57,216 --> 00:22:58,410
l'm having a son.

299
00:23:06,392 --> 00:23:09,293
Yes! And that would be a shutdown!

300
00:23:09,362 --> 00:23:10,386
Shutout!

301
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:17,168
Where you going? One more game!

302
00:23:17,203 --> 00:23:20,263
-lt's 2:0 in the morning.
-Yeah, get out!

303
00:23:20,473 --> 00:23:23,408
You guys always hang out
in my apartment.

304
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,303
l'll only use my left hand.

305
00:23:26,412 --> 00:23:28,380
Come on, wussies!

306
00:23:32,385 --> 00:23:34,410
All right! Olkay! l gotta go!

307
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:36,312
l'm going.

308
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,282
And l'm gone.

309
00:23:41,227 --> 00:23:43,195
-One more game?
-Oh, yeah.
