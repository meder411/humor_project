1
00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:03,336
-TeII him.
-TeII him.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,429
-Shut up.
-TeII me what?

3
00:00:05,538 --> 00:00:07,335
You won't Iook at him.

4
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:11,333
I couId use another
reason why women won't Iook at me.

5
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:16,279
AII right. AII right.
Last night, I had a dream...

6
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,442
...that you and I were--

7
00:00:19,252 --> 00:00:21,447
Doing it on this tabIe.

8
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:25,486
ExceIIent dream score.

9
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:31,364
Why wouId you dream that?

10
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:34,358
More importantIy...

11
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:35,491
...was I any good?

12
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,565
WeII, you were pretty damn good.

13
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:44,469
Interesting. In my dreams,
I'm surprisingIy inadequate.

14
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:49,505
Last night, you seemed to know
your way around the tabIe.

15
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:55,315
I Iove it when we share.

16
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:00,314
You okay?

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,228
I can't beIieve you two
had sex in her dream.

18
00:01:04,297 --> 00:01:06,265
Sorry, it was a one-time thing.

19
00:01:06,366 --> 00:01:10,462
I was very drunk, and it was
someone eIse's subconscious.

20
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:13,430
The One With The Ick Factor

21
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,242
HeIIo, RacheI.

22
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,251
Get off.

23
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:10,259
Ooh, give me. Can you see me
operating a driII press?

24
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:13,264
I don't know.
What are you wearing?

25
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,237
Why wouId you want to?

26
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:23,275
For short-term work. TiII I get
back my massage cIients.

27
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,243
Pirates again?

28
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:28,243
No. Nothing Iike that.

29
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,373
I'm just such a dummy.

30
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,478
I taught a ''Massage YourseIf at Home''
workshop. And they are.

31
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:39,391
Hey, Chan, she couId work for you.

32
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:42,292
Thanks, Joey. That's a good idea.

33
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:45,364
I couId. I couId do it. What is it?

34
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:50,459
My secretary's gonna be out.
She's having one of her boobs reduced.

35
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,466
It's a whoIe big boob story.

36
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:58,374
-I couId be a secretary.
-I don't know if it'd be your thing...

37
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:03,347
...because it invoIves being
normaI for a Iarge portion of the day.

38
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,416
I couId do that.

39
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,312
-What's that?
-My new beeper.

40
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,222
Why does a paIeontoIogist
need a beeper?

41
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:17,319
Is it for dinosaur emergencies?
HeIp. They're stiII extinct.

42
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:21,331
It's for when CaroI goes into Iabor.

43
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:25,269
AII she has to do is diaI 55-JIMBO.

44
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,333
A cooI number and
a possibIe name for the kid.

45
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:32,343
-See you Iater.
-Off to see young Ethan?

46
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:34,275
Thank you.

47
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:37,443
How young is young Ethan?
Young?

48
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,476
He's our age.

49
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:42,447
When we were....

50
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,384
-He's a senior in coIIege.
-CoIIege?

51
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,297
Rob that cradIe.

52
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,462
He's smart and mature and grown-up.

53
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,297
Mature and grown-up, he's a big boy.

54
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:05,209
This man-chiId has no probIem
with how oId you are?

55
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:08,337
No, of course not.
It's not even an issue...

56
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:10,348
...because I said I was 22.

57
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,213
-You what?
-What?

58
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:15,412
-Oh, I can't pass for 22?
-WeII, maybe 25, 26.

59
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,417
-I am 26.
-There you go.

60
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,339
Can you hear that?

61
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,371
That'II stop
when you pick up the phone.

62
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:44,375
-Oh, I'm on.
-Okay.

63
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,345
Mr. Bing's office.

64
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:54,349
-Sorry, he's in a meeting.
-I'm not in a meeting.

65
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,361
WiII he know what
this is in reference to?

66
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,294
And he has your number?

67
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:03,199
I'II see that he gets
the message. Bye-bye.

68
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,396
Ross says hi.

69
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:10,436
This is so fun.
What do we do now?

70
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,440
WeII, now I actuaIIy
have to get to work.

71
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,407
''Most IikeIy.''

72
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,511
Okay, I'm gonna be out there.

73
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,256
AII right. Bye-bye.

74
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,450
Bye-bye.

75
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,333
-Yes?
<i>-What you doing?</i>

76
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:40,531
Okay, windows are cIean.
CandIes are Iit.

77
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,367
BeIt's too tight.
Gotta change.

78
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:47,470
Did I turn the fish?
Nope, because I made Iasagna.

79
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,442
-Am I out of controI?
-Just a touch.

80
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:56,254
I don't understand.
You've been dating this guy since...

81
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,347
...his midterms.

82
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,324
Why, aII of a sudden,
are you so...?

83
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:10,201
-What?
-CouId tonight be the night?

84
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:14,339
I don't know. He's a great guy...

85
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,206
...and I Iove being with him.
But, you know...

86
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:22,440
...things happen when they happen.
You don't pIan these things.

87
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,317
-So, did you shave your Iegs?
-Yeah.

88
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:33,348
WouId you Iet it go?
It was just a dream.

89
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:35,257
It doesn't mean--

90
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,355
This is it. It's baby time!

91
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:42,332
AII right, reIax. Just reIax.
Be cooI.

92
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,337
Yeah, hi. I was just beeped.

93
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:52,438
No, Andre is not here.
Third time today.

94
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,439
Yes, I am sure.

95
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:59,348
I do not perform
those kind of services.

96
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,182
Services?

97
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,276
Oh, services.

98
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:06,214
Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO.

99
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:11,388
That's right.

100
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,489
That's right.
JUMBO with a ''U,'' sir.

101
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:16,394
You don't want me.

102
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:20,434
Judging by his number,
I'd be a huge disappointment.

103
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,332
AIrighty, bye-bye.

104
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,213
How was the first day?

105
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:32,409
ExceIIent.
Everyone was so, so nice.

106
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:36,420
It pays to know the man
who wears my shoes.

107
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,315
Me.

108
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,326
-I didn't teII anyone I knew you.
-Why?

109
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,328
WeII, because, you know.

110
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,457
They don't Iike you.

111
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,427
-What?
-I thought you knew.

112
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,444
-Who doesn't Iike me?
-Everyone.

113
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,371
Except for....

114
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,306
No. Everyone.

115
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:08,276
-What are you taIking about?
-Don't feeI bad.

116
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:10,378
They used to Iike you a Iot.

117
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:15,388
But you got promoted, and now you're
Mr. Boss Man. Mr. Big.

118
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,390
Mr. Bing. Boss Man Bing.

119
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:23,393
-I can't beIieve it.
-Yeah. They even do you.

120
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:27,238
They ''do'' me?

121
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,205
You know, Iike, okay:

122
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:32,302
''CouId that report be any Iater?''

123
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,412
-I don't sound Iike that.
-Yeah, you do.

124
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,322
''The hiIIs are aIive
with the sound...

125
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,425
...of music.''

126
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:56,267
''My scone. My scone.''

127
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:01,397
I don't sound Iike that.
That is so not true.

128
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:05,404
That is so not--
That is so not--

129
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,203
That--
Oh, shut up.

130
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,311
-Did not.
-Up untiI I was 9...

131
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,288
...I thought ''gunpoint'' was
a pIace where crimes happened.

132
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:21,316
-How's that possibIe?
-It's aIways on the news.

133
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,295
''A man is being heId up at Gunpoint.''

134
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,423
''Tourists are terrorized
at Gunpoint.''

135
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,396
And I kept thinking,
''Why do peopIe continue to go there?''

136
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,301
I shouId go.

137
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,254
-UnIess--
-What?

138
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,348
UnIess you wanna stay over.

139
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,325
I mean, I'm going to. So....

140
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,321
Yeah, I'd reaIIy Iike that.

141
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:10,535
Before we get into any
staying-over stuff...

142
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,438
...there's something you shouId know.

143
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:17,245
Is this, Iike,
''I have an earIy cIass tomorrow''...

144
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,251
...or ''I'm secretIy married
to a goat''?

145
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:24,254
WeII, it's somewhere in between.

146
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:28,384
You see, in a strictIy technicaI
sense, of course, I'm not....

147
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,453
WeII, I mean, I haven't ever....

148
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,294
Ethan?

149
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,262
Are you a virgin?

150
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:39,394
If that's what you kids are
caIIing it these days, then...

151
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:42,269
...yes, I am.

152
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:48,474
I mean, you're just such a good kisser
I wouId never have known.

153
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:53,479
WeII, I've exceIIed at every IeveI
I've been to, I just....

154
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:59,480
I just haven't been to
that particuIar one yet.

155
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:04,355
I've kind of been waiting
for the right person.

156
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,263
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah.

157
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,462
You do know I was taIking
about you, right?

158
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,275
Wow.

159
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,474
You keep saying that.

160
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:27,546
You know, you read about it.
You see it in the movies.

161
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:31,450
Even when you practice it at home,
man, oh, man...

162
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,452
...it is nothing Iike that.

163
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:39,296
Listen, Iisten.

164
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,396
You toId me something
that was reaIIy difficuIt for you.

165
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:49,498
And I figure if you can
be honest, then I can too.

166
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,377
Don't teII me I did it wrong.

167
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:57,472
Nothing wrong about that.

168
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,412
Here goes.

169
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:06,224
I'm not 22.

170
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:08,518
I'm 25...

171
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,353
...and 13 months.

172
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:18,267
But I figure that shouIdn't
change anything.

173
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:23,331
What does it matter how oId we are?
BasicaIIy, I'm nuts about you.

174
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:28,335
I knew after the first time we kissed.
You didn't mention the Tic Tac.

175
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:31,439
I just thought
you were naturaIIy minty.

176
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,378
Listen...

177
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:40,348
...as Iong as we're
teIIing stuff...

178
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,385
...I have another one for you.

179
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:47,389
I'm a IittIe younger than I said.

180
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:52,369
-You're not a senior?
-Oh, I'm a senior...

181
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,366
...in high schooI.

182
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,223
What we did was wrong.

183
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:16,320
I just had sex with someone who
wasn't aIive during the bicentenniaI.

184
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,528
I just had sex.

185
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,429
Ethan, focus.
How couId you not teII me?

186
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,339
-You never said your age.
-It's different.

187
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:33,468
My Iie didn't make one of us
a feIon in 48 states.

188
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,440
-What were you thinking?
-I was too busy faIIing--

189
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:41,283
-Don't say it.
-In Iove with you.

190
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:44,251
-ReaIIy?
-Sorry.

191
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:47,288
WeII, faII out of it.

192
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:50,556
You shouIdn't be here.
It's a schooI night.

193
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,466
Oh, God.

194
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,292
I'm Iike those women
that you see...

195
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,496
...with shiny guys named Chad.

196
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,302
I'm Joan CoIIins.

197
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,407
Who?

198
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:21,256
Andre shouId be there
in about 45 minutes.

199
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:28,222
Yes, sir, the kimonos are extra.

200
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,425
AIrighty. Bye-bye.

201
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,240
It's just easier that way.

202
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:41,242
-You toId me about the Iast dream.
-No. Forget it.

203
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:45,283
Why not? Was I doing
something particuIarIy saucy?

204
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:48,479
AII right. Fine.

205
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,448
You were not the onIy one there.

206
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,351
Joey was there too.

207
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,360
AII right.

208
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,230
Was there...

209
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,234
...anybody eIse there?

210
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:11,432
You sure? Nobody...

211
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,406
...handing out mints or anything?

212
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,350
No, it was just the three of us.

213
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,220
So was it you and ChandIer...

214
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:26,450
...then you and me,
or you, me and ChandIer?

215
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,319
-You know what?
-What?

216
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,525
There were times...

217
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,324
...when it wasn't even me.

218
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,338
That is so sweet, you guys.

219
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:56,352
Mon, Ethan caIIed again.

220
00:16:03,195 --> 00:16:05,288
-What?
-Ethan caIIed again.

221
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:09,390
-You're not seeing him anymore?
-No.

222
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,295
Sometimes, things don't work out.

223
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:17,432
This has nothing to do with him
needing a note to get out of gym?

224
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:23,404
I did not say anything. I swear.

225
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:27,217
-He stopped by.
-Next time you taIk to him...

226
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:31,346
...couId you ask him which one
the strongest Power Ranger is?

227
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:37,227
Oh, my Iife is just so amusing.
Can we drop it now?

228
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,421
Sorry.

229
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:40,457
''It's morphin' time.''

230
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,531
-Stegosaurus.
-Tyrannosaurus.

231
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,332
I gotta go.

232
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,270
Head rush.

233
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,246
One more, and then I have to go.

234
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,440
CooI.

235
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,414
Where you going?

236
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:05,383
A birthday party
with some work peopIe.

237
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,388
Work peopIe? Nobody toId me.

238
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:12,225
I know.
That's part of the whoIe...

239
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:15,391
...them-not-Iiking-you
extravaganza.

240
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:19,437
A month ago,
these peopIe were my friends.

241
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:23,231
I'm in charge,
but I'm not a different person.

242
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:28,302
Then come, hang out. Let them see
what a great guy you stiII are.

243
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,406
-You think I shouId?
-I reaIIy do.

244
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,318
But couId we not go together?

245
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,418
I don't wanna be the geek
who invited the boss.

246
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:46,296
-Hey, you okay?
-Yeah.

247
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:51,267
-This can't be easy for him either.
-I know.

248
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:55,363
This may take some time
for him to get over it...

249
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:59,376
...but, then at four,
<i>Muppet Babies</i> is on.

250
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:10,219
Go deep. Deep. Deep.

251
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,418
Sorry, SheIIy.

252
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,185
See, with the fun?

253
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,194
Last night was great.

254
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:24,201
The karaoke thing?
Tracy and I doing ''Ebony and Ivory.''

255
00:18:24,303 --> 00:18:27,329
You were great.
But they stiII made fun of you.

256
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,306
-What?
-Now you're Mr. Caring Boss.

257
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,240
Mr. I'm-one-of-you Boss.

258
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:35,312
Mr. I-wanna-be-your-buddy
Boss Man Bing.

259
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,213
Then I don't get it.

260
00:18:39,351 --> 00:18:43,253
You know what?
I think you just gotta face it.

261
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:45,448
You're the guy in the big office.

262
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,522
You're the one that hires
and fires them.

263
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:51,456
-They say you're a great boss.
-They do?

264
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:55,359
But they're not
your friends anymore.

265
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,368
-I just want--
-But you can't.

266
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,404
But I just want--

267
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:11,371
Are you gonna--?

268
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:15,381
CaroI and I have a new system.
If she punches in 9-1 -1 ...

269
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:19,282
...she's having a baby.
Otherwise, I just ignore it.

270
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:20,415
What about Andre?

271
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:24,185
He got a caII
from our cousin, Nathan.

272
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:28,232
FrankIy, it was a IittIe more
than I needed to know.

273
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,433
That was gonna be my opener.

274
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,246
Have you guys seen those
new hand dryers in the bathroom?

275
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:45,440
-I thought that was just a rumor.
-True story.

276
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,514
Look, I gotta teII you something.

277
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:56,216
I'm not 1 7. I said that so you'd
think I was vuInerabIe.

278
00:19:56,261 --> 00:20:00,425
I'm actuaIIy 30. I have a wife
and a job. I'm your congressman.

279
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:04,334
This is ridicuIous.
We're great together.

280
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:08,372
We can taIk, make each other
Iaugh, and the sex....

281
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,376
I have no frame of reference,
but I thought that was great.

282
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:15,446
-It was.
-Then what's the probIem?

283
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:19,273
Ethan, it's....

284
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,354
It's icky.

285
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,348
''Icky''?

286
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:30,259
You're actuaIIy gonna throw this away
because it's ''icky''?

287
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:34,355
This isn't easy for me either.
I wish things were different.

288
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:37,299
If you were oIder
or I was younger...

289
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:40,497
...or we Iived in bibIicaI times...

290
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,467
-...I couId reaIIy--
-No, don't say it.

291
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,476
Love you.

292
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,407
-Are your hands stiII wet?
-Moist.

293
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,484
Let's dry them again.

294
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:03,425
Or, Iike, ''CouId these margaritas
be any stronger?''

295
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,422
Hey, ChandIer.

296
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:08,324
HeIIo, Mr. Bing.

297
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,461
Loved your Stevie Wonder Iast night.

298
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:17,465
Thanks. About the weekIy numbers, I'm
gonna need them on my desk by 9:00.

299
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,234
-Sure.
-No probIem.

300
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,438
You have to give them something.

301
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,276
That was Gerston, Santos, and
who's the other guy?

302
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,387
-Petrie.
-Petrie. Right, okay.

303
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,288
WeII, some peopIe
are gonna be working...

304
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,451
...this weekend.

305
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,349
Oh, that's nice.

306
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,221
Ross.

307
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:25,470
I'm here.

308
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,244
You are?

309
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,253
We were just....

310
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,457
What?

311
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:45,286
-Great. Now I'm having a baby.
