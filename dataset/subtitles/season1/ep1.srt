1
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:05,362
The One Where It AII Began (PiIot)

2
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,486
There's nothing to teII.
It's just some guy I work with.

3
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,228
You're going out with the guy.

4
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,455
There has to be something
wrong with him.

5
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,256
AII right, Joey.
Be nice.

6
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,460
So does he have a hump
and a hairpiece?

7
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,271
Wait, does he eat chaIk?

8
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,434
I don't want her to go through
what I did with CarI.

9
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:21,470
Okay, everybody reIax.
This is not even a date.

10
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:26,344
It's just two peopIe going out
to dinner and not having sex.

11
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:29,445
Sounds Iike a date to me.

12
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:34,256
I'm in high schooI,
in the cafeteria...

13
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:37,354
...and I reaIize I'm totaIIy naked.

14
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,364
I've had that dream.

15
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:43,367
Then I Iook down and I reaIize
there is a phone...

16
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,462
...there.

17
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:50,308
-Instead of--
-That's right!

18
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,274
Never had that one.

19
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:56,476
AII of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

20
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,581
What do I do?
Everyone starts Iooking at me.

21
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,414
They weren't Iooking at you before?

22
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:07,325
FinaIIy, I figure
I'd better answer it.

23
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:11,329
And it turns out it's my mother.

24
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:15,390
Which is very, very weird
because she never caIIs me.

25
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,271
Hi.

26
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,246
He says, ''HeIIo,''
I want to kiII myseIf.

27
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,271
You okay?

28
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:35,448
I feeI Iike someone puIIed my
intestine out of my mouth...

29
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:40,352
-...and tied it around my neck.
-Cookie?

30
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,394
CaroI moved her stuff out today.

31
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:46,489
-Let me get you some coffee.
-Thanks.

32
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,364
No, don't!
Stop cIeansing my aura.

33
00:02:55,475 --> 00:03:00,242
-Just Ieave my aura aIone, okay?
-Fine, be murky.

34
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:04,247
-I'II be fine. I hope she'II be happy.
-No, you don't.

35
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,445
No, I don't.
To heII with her. She Ieft me!

36
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,416
You never knew she was a Iesbian?

37
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,228
No! Okay?

38
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,321
Why does everyone
keep fixating on that?

39
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:24,334
She didn't know.
How shouId I know?

40
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:29,330
Sometimes I wish I was a Iesbian.

41
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,268
Did I say that out Ioud?

42
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,282
I toId Mom and Dad Iast night.
They took it pretty weII.

43
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,373
Oh, reaIIy?

44
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:43,354
So that hystericaI phone caII
from a woman sobbing...

45
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:48,292
...''I'II never have grandchiIdren,''
was what? A wrong number?

46
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,350
Sorry.

47
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:53,364
Look, you're feeIing
a Iot of pain right now.

48
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:56,299
You're angry.
You're hurting.

49
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,462
Can I teII you what
the answer is?

50
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,233
Strip joints!

51
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,401
Hey, you're singIe.
Have some hormones.

52
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,209
But I don't want
to be singIe, okay?

53
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:11,408
I just want to be married again.

54
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:19,419
And I just want a miIIion doIIars!

55
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:26,526
-RacheI?
-Oh, Monica! Thank God!

56
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,267
I went to your buiIding...

57
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:33,237
...and a guy with a hammer
said you'd be here, and you are.

58
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:37,275
-Can I get you some coffee?
-Decaf.

59
00:04:37,477 --> 00:04:41,345
Everybody, this is RacheI,
a LincoIn High survivor.

60
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:44,248
This is everybody.
ChandIer and Phoebe...

61
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,341
...Joey.
Remember my brother, Ross?

62
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,476
Sure!

63
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:02,298
You want to teII us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

64
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:08,306
WeII, it started about
a haIf-hour before the wedding.

65
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,309
I was in the room
with aII the presents...

66
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:17,249
...and I was Iooking at this
reaIIy gorgeous Limoges gravy boat.

67
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,217
When aII of a sudden--

68
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,308
Sweet 'N Low?

69
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:26,414
I reaIized I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than Barry.

70
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,427
I got freaked out,
and it hit me:

71
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,424
How much Barry Iooks
Iike Mr. Potato Head.

72
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,460
I aIways knew
he Iooked famiIiar, but....

73
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,433
I had to get out of there,
and I started wondering...

74
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:46,377
...''Why am I doing this,''
and ''Who am I doing it for?''

75
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:50,439
I didn't know where to go,
and I know we've drifted apart...

76
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,252
...but you're the onIy person
I know here.

77
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:59,451
-Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
-I hoped that wouIdn't be an issue.

78
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:21,202
I guess he bought her the pipe organ,
and she's reaIIy not happy about it.

79
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:24,315
''Tuna or egg saIad!
Decide!''

80
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:30,354
''I'II have whatever
Christina's having.''

81
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:34,223
Daddy, I just--
I can't marry him.

82
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,320
I'm sorry.
I just don't Iove him.

83
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:43,425
WeII, it matters to me!

84
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:50,469
''If I Iet go of my hair,
my head wiII faII off.''

85
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:55,345
She shouId not be
wearing those pants.

86
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,281
Push her down the stairs!

87
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,317
Push her!
Push her down the stairs!

88
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,325
Come on, Daddy, Iisten!

89
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:12,290
AII my Iife, everyone's
aIways toId me, ''You're a shoe!''

90
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:14,492
''You're a shoe!''

91
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:18,226
What if I don't want to be a shoe?

92
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:21,296
What if I want to be a purse?

93
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:24,240
Or a hat?

94
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,208
No, I don't want you
to buy me a hat!

95
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:30,339
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

96
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,413
You can see where he'd have troubIe.

97
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,255
Look, Daddy,
it's my Iife.

98
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:43,259
WeII, maybe I'II just stay
here with Monica.

99
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,425
I guess we've estabIished
she's staying with Monica.

100
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:52,328
WeII, maybe that's my decision.

101
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:54,463
Maybe I don't need your money.

102
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,276
Wait!
I said maybe!

103
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,287
Just breathe. That's it.

104
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,188
Try to think of nice, caIm things.

105
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,384
<i>Raindrops on roses</i>
<i>And whiskers on kittens</i>

106
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:19,289
<i>Doorbells and sleigh bells</i>
<i>And something with mittens</i>

107
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,430
<i>La la la something</i>
<i>And noodles with string</i>

108
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,237
I'm aII better now.

109
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,402
I heIped.

110
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:34,242
This is probabIy for the best.

111
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:39,412
Independence. ControIIing your Iife.
The whoIe hat thing.

112
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:43,479
You can aIways come to Joey.

113
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,420
Me and ChandIer Iive across the haII.
He's away a Iot.

114
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:52,261
Stop hitting on her!
It's her wedding day.

115
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,423
Like there's a ruIe, or something?

116
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:00,199
I got it.

117
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,434
PIease don't do that again.
It's a horribIe sound.

118
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,369
<i>It's Paul.</i>

119
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:09,272
Oh, God, is it 6:30?
Buzz him in.

120
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,180
-Who's PauI?
-PauI, the wine guy?

121
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,274
Maybe.

122
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:16,413
Your ''not a reaI date''
is with PauI, the wine guy?

123
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,316
-He finaIIy asked you out?
-Yes!

124
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,225
It's a ''Dear Diary'' moment.

125
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:25,389
-Rach, I can canceI.
-PIease, go, I'II be fine.

126
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,327
Ross, are you okay?
Do you want me to stay?

127
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:33,337
That'd be good.

128
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:38,400
-ReaIIy?
-Go on! It's PauI, the wine guy!

129
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,337
Does he seII it, drink it?

130
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,349
Or he just compIains a Iot?

131
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,215
Hi, come in!
PauI, this is...

132
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,414
...everybody.
Everybody, this is PauI.

133
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:56,317
-The wine guy.
-I didn't catch your name. PauI?

134
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,256
I'II be right back.
I've just gotta go--

135
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,427
A-wandering?

136
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,260
Change.

137
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,464
Sit down.
Two seconds.

138
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:16,244
I just puIIed out four eyeIashes.
That can't be good.

139
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:22,352
Hey, PauI, here's a tip.

140
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:27,257
She reaIIy Iikes it when you
rub her neck in the same spot...

141
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,261
...untiI it starts to get red.

142
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,457
Shut up, Joey!

143
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,291
What are you up to tonight?

144
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:40,466
I was supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon...

145
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,366
...so, nothing.

146
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,503
Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

147
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,510
AIthough, Aruba.
This time of year?

148
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,376
TaIk about your...

149
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,285
...big Iizards.

150
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,359
If you don't want
to be aIone tonight...

151
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:06,262
...Joey and ChandIer are
heIping me with my furniture.

152
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,459
We're very excited about it.

153
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:12,261
Thanks. But I'm just
going to hang out here.

154
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,362
-It's been a Iong day.
-Oh, sure.

155
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,236
Pheebs, wanna heIp?

156
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:20,277
I wish I couId,
but I don't want to.

157
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:34,293
<i>Love is sweet as summer showers</i>
<i>Love is a wondrous work of art</i>

158
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:40,296
<i>But your love</i>
<i>Oh, your love, your love</i>

159
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:44,462

00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,468
<i>Crapping on my heart</i>

161
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,278
Thank you.

162
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,447
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things...

163
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,455
...using a bunch of these
IittIe worm guys.

164
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:14,459
I have no bracket-y thing.
I see no worm guys whatsoever...

165
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,464
...and I cannot feeI my Iegs.

166
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:25,242
-We got a bookcase.
-It's beautifuI.

167
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:27,241
What's this?

168
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,273
I wouId have to say
that is an L-shaped bracket.

169
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:36,444
-Which goes where?
-I have no idea.

170
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:41,483
-Done with the bookcase.
-AII finished.

171
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,290
This was CaroI's favorite beer.

172
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:53,260
She aIways drank it out of the can.
I shouId have known.

173
00:12:56,408 --> 00:13:01,402
-Start with that, we're out of here.
-PIease don't spoiI aII this fun.

174
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,311
Let me ask you.

175
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:07,445
She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

176
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,448
What did you get?

177
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:13,248
-You guys.
-You got screwed.

178
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:17,523
-Oh, my God.
-I know. I'm such an idiot.

179
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:22,428
I shouId've known when she went to
the dentist five times a week.

180
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:25,265
I mean, how cIean can teeth get?

181
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,430
My brother's going through that.

182
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,366
How did you get over it?

183
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:33,275
He might accidentaIIy
break something vaIuabIe of hers.

184
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,244
-Say her--
-Leg?

185
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:39,283
That's one way of doing it.
I went for the watch.

186
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,352
You actuaIIy broke her watch?

187
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:46,449
The worst I ever did was shred
my oId boyfriend's favorite toweI.

188
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:50,387
-Steer cIear of you.
-That's right.

189
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:54,266
Barry, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.

190
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:59,463
You probabIy think it's about making
Iove with your socks on, but it isn't.

191
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,400
It's about me.
And I just--

192
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:12,307
The machine cut me off again.
Anyway....

193
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:22,250
I know that some Iucky girI is going
to become Mrs. Barry FinkeI.

194
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:26,230
But it isn't me.
It's not me.

195
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:30,428
Not that I have any idea who ''me'' is
right now, but you just--

196
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:34,431
I'm divorced.

197
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:41,271
-I'm onIy 26, and I'm divorced!
-Shut up!

198
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:48,282
That onIy took me an hour.

199
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:55,352
We haven't had a reIationship
that's Iasted Ionger than a Mento.

200
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:00,322
You have had the Iove of a woman
for four years.

201
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:06,201
Four years of cIoseness and sharing,
after which she ripped your heart out.

202
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,230
That is why we don't do it!

203
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,336
I don't think that was my point!

204
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:17,439
IKnow what's scary? What if there's
onIy one woman for everybody?

205
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,243
I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

206
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,314
UnfortunateIy, in my case,
there was onIy one woman for her.

207
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:31,421
What are you taIking about?
One woman.

208
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,459
That's Iike saying there's onIy
one fIavor of ice cream.

209
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:40,262
Let me teII you something.
There's Iots of fIavors out there.

210
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:44,332
Rocky road and cookie dough
and bing cherry vaniIIa.

211
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:49,371
You can get them with jimmies
or nuts or whipped cream.

212
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,376
It's the best thing
to happen to you!

213
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:56,443
You got married.
You were Iike, what, 8?

214
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:01,291
WeIcome back to the worId.
Grab a spoon!

215
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:06,194
-I don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
-Then stay out of my freezer.

216
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:13,295
Ever since she waIked out on me....

217
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:15,407
What?

218
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,301
You wanna speII it out with noodIes?

219
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:23,313
It's more of a fifth date
kind of reveIation.

220
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:28,218
So there's going to be
a fifth date?

221
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:29,447
Isn't there?

222
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,315
Yeah, yeah.
I think there is.

223
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:37,252
What were you going to say?

224
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:43,458
Ever since she Ieft me...

225
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,466
...I haven't been abIe to perform...

226
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,339
...sexuaIIy.

227
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:54,435
Oh, God!
I'm so sorry.

228
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,281
Being spit on is probabIy
not what you need right now.

229
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,216
How Iong?

230
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:05,313
-Two years.
-Wow.

231
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:09,384
I'm gIad you smashed her watch.

232
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:15,323
So you stiII think you might
want that fifth date?

233
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:21,229
Yeah.
Yeah, I do.

234
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:26,400
<i>We are gathered here</i>
<i>to join Joanie Louise Cunningham...</i>

235
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:32,247
<i>...and Charles.</i>
<i>Chachi, Chachi, Chachi...</i>

236
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:37,217
<i>...in the bonds of holy matrimony.</i>

237
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,278
See!

238
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:44,353
But Joanie Ioved Chachi.
That's the difference.

239
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:47,264
''Grab a spoon.''

240
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:50,426
Do you know how Iong it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

241
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:55,366
Do the words, ''BiIIy, don't be
a hero,'' mean anything to you?

242
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:02,213
Great story.
But I gotta go.

243
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:07,218
I got a date with Andrea.
AngeIa. No, Andrea.

244
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:10,414
Andrea's the screamer.
AngeIa has cats.

245
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,388
Right, thanks. It's JuIie.
I'm out of here.

246
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:21,325
Here's the thing. Even if
I couId get it together enough...

247
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,301
...to ask a woman out...

248
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,236
...who am I going to ask?

249
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:54,264
Isn't this amazing?
I've never made coffee in my Iife.

250
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,459
-That is amazing.
-CongratuIations.

251
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:00,466
If I can make coffee,
there isn't anything I can't do.

252
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:06,367
I think it's, ''If I can invade PoIand,
there's nothing I can't do.''

253
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:11,314
If you feeI Iike you have to make
a Western omeIet or something....

254
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,482
AIthough, actuaIIy
I'm reaIIy not that hungry.

255
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:22,318
Oh, good.
Lenny and Squiggy are here.

256
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,220
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

257
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,200
-Morning.
-Morning, PauI.

258
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,236
-HeIIo, PauI.
-Hi. PauI, is it?

259
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:42,246
-Thank you so much.
-Stop.

260
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:46,444
Last night was Iike
aII my birthdays, both graduations...

261
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,413
...pIus the barn-raising scene
in <i>Witness.</i>

262
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,520
We'II taIk Iater.

263
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,528
Thank you.

264
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:14,337
That wasn't a reaI date.

265
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,439
What the heII do you do
on a reaI date?

266
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,475
Shut up and put my tabIe back.

267
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,355
I've got to get to work.

268
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:30,259
If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

269
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,459
So, Iike, you guys aII have jobs?

270
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:41,399
Yeah, we aII have jobs.
That's how we buy stuff.

271
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:47,502
-Yeah, I'm an actor.
-Have I seen you in anything?

272
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,373
I doubt it.
MostIy regionaI work.

273
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:54,283
UnIess you saw the Wee One's
production of <i>Pinocchio...</i>

274
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:57,288
...at the IittIe theater
in the park?

275
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,481
It was a job!

276
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,417
''Look, Geppetto.
I'm a reaI Iive boy.''

277
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:08,322
-I wiII not take this abuse.
-You're right, I'm sorry.

278
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,268
<i>Once I was a wooden boy</i>
<i>A little wooden boy</i>

279
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:17,465
You shouId both know
that he's a dead man.

280
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,234
Oh, ChandIer!

281
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,440
How are you doing today?
SIeep okay?

282
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:28,485
Did you taIk to Barry?
I can't stop smiIing.

283
00:21:29,254 --> 00:21:33,384
I see that. You Iook Iike you
sIept with a hanger in your mouth.

284
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:41,355
I know.
He's just so....

285
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,469
-Remember you and Tony Demarco?
-Oh, yeah.

286
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:48,405
WeII, it's Iike that.
With feeIings.

287
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,377
-Wow, are you in troubIe!
-Big time!

288
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:56,308
Want a wedding dress?
HardIy used.

289
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:59,509
I think we're getting a IittIe
ahead of ourseIves.

290
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:04,416
I'm going to get up, go to work,
and not think about him aII day.

291
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:08,416
Or eIse I'm going to get up
and go to work.

292
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,360
-Wish me Iuck!
-What for?

293
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:15,230
I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.

294
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,437
-Hi, Monica.
-Franny, weIcome back.

295
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:31,243
-How was FIorida?
-You had sex, didn't you?

296
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:35,344
-How do you do that?
-I hate you.

297
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:39,380
I'm pushing my aunt through
Parrot JungIe, you're having sex.

298
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,484
So, who?

299
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,454
You know PauI?

300
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:48,357
PauI, the wine guy?
Yeah, I know PauI.

301
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:53,367
You mean, you know PauI
Iike I know PauI?

302
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,463
What?
I take credit for PauI.

303
00:22:56,274 --> 00:23:00,233
Before me, there was no snap in his
turtIe for two years.

304
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,215
Of course it was a Iine.

305
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:09,219
Why wouId anybody
do something Iike that?

306
00:23:09,321 --> 00:23:12,347
I assume we want an answer
more sophisticated than:

307
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:15,416
''To get you into bed.''

308
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,258
I hate men.

309
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,357
Don't hate. You don't want
to put that out into the universe.

310
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,264
Is it me?

311
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:28,238
Is it Iike I have some sort of
beacon that onIy dogs...

312
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,467
...and men with emotionaI probIems
can hear?

313
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:34,336
Come here.
Give me your feet.

314
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,444
I just thought he was nice, you know?

315
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:50,552
I can't beIieve
you didn't know it was a Iine.

316
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:56,300
-Guess what?
-You got a job?

317
00:23:56,368 --> 00:24:00,395
Are you kidding?
I'm trained for nothing.

318
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:04,437
-I was Iaughed out of 1 2 interviews.
-You're surprisingIy upbeat.

319
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:08,303
You'd be too,
if you found these boots on saIe...

320
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:10,347
...50% off.

321
00:24:10,415 --> 00:24:13,407
How weII you know me.

322
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,313
They're my
''I don't need a job...

323
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:19,413
...I've got great boots'' boots.

324
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:23,318
-How did you pay?
-Credit card.

325
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,363
And who pays for that?

326
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,366
My father.

327
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:35,465
Is this reaIIy necessary?
I can stop charging any time.

328
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:38,334
You can't Iive off your parents.

329
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:42,278
I know that.
That's why I was getting married.

330
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:46,244
Give her a break.
It's hard being on your own.

331
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:47,340
Thank you.

332
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:50,548
I remember when I first
came to this city, I was 1 4.

333
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:54,258
Mom had kiIIed herseIf,
stepdad was in jaiI.

334
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,293
I didn't know anybody here.

335
00:24:56,394 --> 00:25:01,195
I ended up Iiving with this aIbino
guy who was cIeaning windshieIds.

336
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:03,199
And then he kiIIed himseIf.

337
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:07,499
Then I found aromatherapy.
So I know exactIy how you feeI.

338
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:13,436
The word you're Iooking for is:

339
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,213
''Anyway....''

340
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:24,416
-You ready?
-No, how can I be ready?

341
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,458
''Ready to jump out of the pIane
with no parachute?''

342
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,251
-I can't do this.
-I know you can.

343
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:33,354
-No.
-You made coffee, you can do anything.

344
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:39,226
Cut. Cut. Cut.

345
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:47,439
You know what?
I think we can Ieave it at that.

346
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:51,539
-IKind of a symboIic gesture.
-RacheI, that was a Iibrary card.

347
00:25:58,456 --> 00:26:03,325
If you Iisten cIoseIy, you can hear
a thousand retaiIers scream.

348
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,298
WeIcome to the reaI worId!

349
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,426
It sucks.
You're gonna Iove it.

350
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,437
That's it.
Are you going to crash on the couch?

351
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:27,207
-No, I gotta go home sometime.
-Are you gonna be okay?

352
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,314
Look what I just
found on the fIoor.

353
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,418
What?

354
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:38,428
That's PauI's watch.
Just put it back where you found it.

355
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,357
Oh, boy!
AII right.

356
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:46,265
-Good night, everybody.
-Good night.

357
00:26:56,348 --> 00:27:01,217
-I'm sorry. Have it, I don't want it.
-SpIit it?

358
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:08,417
You probabIy didn't know this,
but in high schooI...

359
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,387
...I had a major crush on you.

360
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,290
I knew.

361
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:17,391
You did?

362
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:21,331
I figured you thought
I was Monica's geeky brother.

363
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:23,397
I did.

364
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,213
Listen, do you think...?

365
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:35,242
Try not to Iet my vuInerabiIity
become a factor here.

366
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:39,514
Do you think it wouId be okay
if I asked you out sometime?

367
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:43,222
Yeah.

368
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:44,352
Maybe.

369
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:48,423
Okay.

370
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,261
Okay, maybe I wiII.

371
00:27:58,376 --> 00:28:01,402
-Good night.
-Good night.

372
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,218
See you.

373
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:21,196
Wait, wait.
What's with you?

374
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:27,428
I just grabbed a spoon.

375
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:38,239
-I can't beIieve what I'm hearing.
<i>-Can't believe what I'm hearing</i>

376
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:40,341
-What? I said--
<i>-What? I said</i>

377
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:44,217
-WouId you stop?
-Was I doing it again?

378
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:46,347
Yes!

379
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:51,327
I said you had a nice butt.
It's just not a great butt.

380
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:55,423
-You won't know a butt if it bit you.
-There's an image.

381
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:01,261
WouId anybody Iike more coffee?

382
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,366
You made it,
or you're serving it?

383
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:08,311
-I'm just serving it.
-I'II have a cup of coffee.

384
00:29:08,379 --> 00:29:10,210
IKids, new dream.

385
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:11,305
I'm in Las Vegas.

386
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:14,283
Miss, more coffee?

387
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:18,321
CouId you give this
to that guy over there?

388
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,420
Go ahead.
Thank you.

389
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:24,388
Sorry.
Okay, Las Vegas.

390
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:27,187

391
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,292
I'm Liza MinneIIi....
