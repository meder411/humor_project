1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,468
Terry, I know I haven't worked here
very Iong but wouId it be possibIe...

2
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:16,272
...if I got a $100 advance
on my saIary?

3
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:18,246
An advance?

4
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:21,286
So I can spend
Thanksgiving with my famiIy.

5
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:25,381
Every year we ski in VaiI,
and my father pays for my ticket.

6
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:28,450
But I've started
this independent thing...

7
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:32,254
...which is actuaIIy why
I took this ''job.''

8
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:36,367
RacheI, RacheI, sweetheart!

9
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:39,464
You're a terribIe, terribIe waitress.

10
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:43,274
ReaIIy, reaIIy awfuI.

11
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:47,503
I hear what you're saying.
I'm with you.

12
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:54,283
But I'm trying reaIIy hard,
and I think I'm doing better.

13
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:56,412
I reaIIy do.

14
00:00:56,489 --> 00:00:59,481
-Does anybody need coffee?
-Yeah, over here.

15
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,287
Look at that.

16
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,423
The One Where Underdog Gets Away

17
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,476
Excuse me, sir? Hi.
You come in here aII the time.

18
00:01:56,516 --> 00:02:02,216
Do you think there's a possibiIity
that you couId advance me my tips?

19
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:08,353
Okay, okay. That's fine. Fine.
Sorry about that spiII before!

20
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,420
OnIy 98.50 to go!

21
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:17,464
Did you know Mom and Dad are going
to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?

22
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:22,230
-What? No, they're not.
-Yes, the BIymans invited them.

23
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:23,468
You're wrong.

24
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:28,243
-I am not wrong.
-You're wrong.

25
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:31,349
No, I just taIked to them.

26
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,243
I'm caIIing Mom.

27
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:40,450
-Hey, hey.
-Hey!

28
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:47,255
And this from the Cry for HeIp
Department: Are you wearing makeup?

29
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:54,397
Yes, I am. As of today, I'm officiaIIy
Joey Tribbiani, actor/modeI.

30
00:02:54,507 --> 00:03:00,309
That's funny. I was thinking you Iook
more Iike, Joey Tribbiani, man/woman.

31
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:05,250
-What were you modeIing for?
-Posters for the free cIinic.

32
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:09,219
So you're gonna be one
of those heaIthy guys?

33
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:13,248
-The asthma guy's reaIIy cute.
-IKnow which one you'II be?

34
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,352
No, but I hear Lyme disease
is open, so you know....

35
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,264
-Good Iuck, man. I hope you get it.
-Thanks.

36
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:29,231
You were right. How can they do this?
It's Thanksgiving!

37
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:33,439
What if I cook dinner at my pIace?
I'II make it just Iike Mom's.

38
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:37,273
WiII you make mashed potatoes
with the Iumps?

39
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:42,352
They're not actuaIIy supposed to--
I'II work on the Iumps.

40
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,280
-Joey, you're going home?
-Yeah.

41
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:49,454
ChandIer, you're stiII boycotting
aII the piIgrim hoIidays?

42
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:54,492
-Every singIe one of them.
-Phoebe, you'II be with your grandma?

43
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,360
And her boyfriend.

44
00:03:56,469 --> 00:04:00,496
We're ceIebrating Thanksgiving
in December because he's Iunar.

45
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,304
So you're free Thursday then?

46
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,440
-Yeah. Oh, can I come?
-Yeah.

47
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:16,414
-Rach, are you gonna make it to VaiI?
-AbsoIuteIy. Shoop, shoop, shoop.

48
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:20,420
-OnIy $102 to go.
-I thought it was 98.50?

49
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,419
Yeah, weII, it was, but I--
I broke a cup, so....

50
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:29,361
-WeII, I'm off to CaroI's.
-Ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?

51
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:35,237
Ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife
and wiII want to bring her...

52
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:38,242
...ooh, ooh, Iesbian Iife partner.

53
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,244
Hi. Is CaroI here?

54
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:54,486
-No, she's at a facuIty meeting.
-I just came by to pick up my skuII.

55
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:58,287
WeII, not mine, but....

56
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,329
-Come in.
-Thanks.

57
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,427
CaroI borrowed it, and I have
to get it back to the museum.

58
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:10,198
-What's it Iook Iike?
-IKind of Iike a big face without skin.

59
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:15,244
Yes. I'm famiIiar with the concept.

60
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:18,215
-We can just Iook for it.
-Okay.

61
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:28,353
Wow, you guys sure have a Iot
of books about being a Iesbian.

62
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,428
WeII, you know,
you have to take a course.

63
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,328
Otherwise they don't Iet you do it.

64
00:05:47,246 --> 00:05:50,443
Hey, <i>Yertle the Turtle</i>! A cIassic.

65
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,447
ActuaIIy, I'm reading it to the baby.

66
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:59,247
The baby that hasn't been born yet?

67
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:02,294
WouIdn't that mean you're crazy?

68
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,290
You don't think
they can hear sounds in there?

69
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,393
You're not serious?
I mean, you reaIIy taIk to it?

70
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:16,402
Yeah, aII the time.
I want the baby to know my voice.

71
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:24,213
WeII, that's just--
Do you taIk about me?

72
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:28,214
-Yeah. AII the time.
-ReaIIy?

73
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:33,418
But, we just refer to you
as ''Bobo the Sperm Guy.''

74
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,367
If she's taIking to it, I just think
I shouId get some beIIy time too.

75
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:51,433
Not that I beIieve this.

76
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:55,379
I beIieve it. I think the baby
can hear everything.

77
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,383
-ReaIIy?
-I'II show you. This'II seem weird.

78
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:01,419
But you put your head
inside this turkey...

79
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:06,280
...and we'II aII taIk
and you'II hear everything we say.

80
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:12,195
I'd just Iike to say I'm totaIIy
behind this experiment.

81
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:16,234
In fact, I'd very much Iike
to butter your head.

82
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:22,205
-Hey.
-Rach, did you make your money?

83
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:26,244
No, not even cIose. Forget VaiI.
Forget seeing my famiIy.

84
00:07:26,345 --> 00:07:30,213
Forget shoop, shoop, shoop.

85
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:37,253
-Rach, here's your maiI.
-Thanks. You can put it on the tabIe.

86
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:41,225
No. Here's your maiI!

87
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,454
Thanks. You can put it on the tabIe!

88
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:48,257
WouId you just open it!

89
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:55,466
Oh, my God! You guys are great!

90
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,335
We aII chipped in.

91
00:07:58,377 --> 00:08:01,175
-We did?
-You owe me $20.

92
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,407
Thank you. Thank you so much!

93
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:07,482
ChandIer, got your traditionaI
hoIiday feast. Tomato soup...

94
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:12,214
...griIIed-cheese fixings
and a famiIy-size bag of Funyuns.

95
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:17,422
This is your Thanksgiving dinner?
What is it with you and this hoIiday?

96
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:22,224
-I'm 9 years oId.
-I hate this story!

97
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:26,396
We've finished this magnificent
Thanksgiving dinner. I have...

98
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:29,197
...a mouthfuI of pumpkin pie.

99
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:33,210
And then my parents teII me
they're getting divorced.

100
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,336
Oh, my God!

101
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:40,215
Very difficuIt to enjoy Thanksgiving
dinner once you've seen it in reverse.

102
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:46,357
What's this?
I never saw this at Mom's.

103
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:49,360
-It's a yam.
-HeIIo....

104
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:55,426
This isn't a yam.
Yam comes in purpIe cans.

105
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:59,261
They don't-- They don't come in these.

106
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:04,273
Ross, don't take this the wrong way
or anything, but back off.

107
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,316
Hi.

108
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,294
-We used to work together.
-We did?

109
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:27,230
Yeah, at Macy's.
You're the Obsession girI, right?

110
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,292
-Yes.
-I was the Aramis guy.

111
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:36,298
-Aramis. Aramis. Aramis.
-Yeah, right!

112
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,337
-You're the best in the business.
-Get out.

113
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:45,406
You're amazing! You know when
to spritz. You know when to Iay back.

114
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:49,449
ReaIIy? You don't know
what that means to me.

115
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:56,427
You smeII great tonight.
What are you wearing?

116
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,327
Nothing.

117
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,242
-Listen, do you wanna go get a drink?
-Yeah, that wouId be--

118
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:17,475
-What's wrong?
-I have to do something.

119
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,376
What?

120
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:25,456
-Leave.
-Wait, wait, wait!

121
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,326
So I guess you aII saw it.

122
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,528
-What?
-Saw what?

123
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:16,469
No, we're just Iaughing. You know
how Iaughter can be infectious.

124
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:40,489
Set another pIace for Thanksgiving.
My entire famiIy thinks I have VD.

125
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:45,269
''Tonight, on a very speciaI <i>Blossom. ''</i>

126
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,506
Looking good! Okay!

127
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:59,479
Cider's muIIing, turkey's turkeying,
yams are yamming....

128
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:01,412
What?

129
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:06,357
I don't know. It's just not
the same without Mom in the kitchen.

130
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,257
Get out and stop annoying me!

131
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,262
Oh, that's cIoser.

132
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,331
I got the tickets!

133
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:18,426
Five hours from now,
shoop, shoop, shoop!

134
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:23,338
-Oh, you must stop shooping.
-Okay, I'm gonna get my stuff.

135
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,239
WiII you come in?

136
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:29,371
I prefer to keep a safe distance
from aII this merriment.

137
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:33,350
Look out! Incoming pumpkin pie!

138
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:44,361
We Iaughed when you did it with
the stuffing, but that's not funny.

139
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:49,360
Hey, Monica, I got a question.
I don't see any Tator Tots.

140
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:54,270
-That's not a question.
-My mom makes them. It's a tradition.

141
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:59,470
You get a piece of turkey on your fork,
a IittIe cranberry sauce and a Tot!

142
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:06,308
I mean, it's bad enough I can't be
with my famiIy because of my disease.

143
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,216
AII right. Fine.

144
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:15,260
Tonight's potatoes wiII be mashed,
with Iumps and in the form of Tots.

145
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:20,357
AII right, I'm off
to taIk to my unborn chiId.

146
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,327
Okay, Mom never hit.

147
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:30,433
Okay, aII done.

148
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:35,470
Phoebe, did you whip the pota--?
Ross needs Iumps!

149
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,442
Oh, I'm sorry! I just--

150
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:43,278
I thought we couId have them whipped
and then add some peas and onions.

151
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,447
Why do that?

152
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:50,285
Because then they'd be just Iike my
mom used to make it, before she died.

153
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,456
Okay. Three kinds
of potatoes coming up.

154
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,397
Okay. Goodbye, you guys!
Thanks for everything!

155
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:05,200
Oh, God, Iook at--
Sorry! I'm so sorry.

156
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:10,204
An unbeIievabIe thing happened!
Underdog got away!

157
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:14,446
-The baIIoon?
-No, no, the actuaI cartoon character.

158
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:18,222
Of course the baIIoon!

159
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:23,227
He broke free and was spotted
fIying over Washington Square Park.

160
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,459
-I'm going to the roof. Who's with me?
-I can't!

161
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:31,226
An 80-foot dog over the city?
How often does that happen?

162
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:32,429
AImost never.

163
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,331
-Got the keys?
-Okay.

164
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,339
Anytime you're ready.

165
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:47,250
Okay. Okay, here we go.

166
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:55,288
Okay. Where am I taIking to here?

167
00:14:56,262 --> 00:15:00,426
There is one way that offers a
certain acousticaI advantage, but....

168
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,198
Just aim for the bump.

169
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,427
Okay.

170
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:10,240
Okay. Okay. Okay, here goes.

171
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:21,308
You know, I can't do this. This is--

172
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:24,322
It's too weird. I feeI stupid.

173
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:29,258
It's fine. You don't have to do it
just because Susan does it.

174
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:33,320
HeIIo, baby. HeIIo. HeIIo.

175
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:38,327
--the moment we first saw
the dog shadow faII over the park!

176
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,363
But did they have to shoot him down?
That was just mean.

177
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:47,234
Right now the turkey shouId
be crispy on the outside...

178
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,439
...and juicy on the inside.

179
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,476
Why are we standing here?

180
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:56,243
We're waiting for you to open
the door. You have the keys.

181
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,481
No, I don't.

182
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,324
Yes, you do. When we Ieft,
you said, ''Got the keys.''

183
00:16:03,228 --> 00:16:07,289
No, I didn't. I asked, ''Got the keys?''

184
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:11,293
No, no, no. You said, ''Got the keys!''

185
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:14,431
Do either of you have the keys?

186
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:18,399
-The oven is on!
-I've gotta get my ticket!

187
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:21,436
-Wait! We have a copy of your key.
-Get it!

188
00:16:22,214 --> 00:16:24,512
That tone won't make me go any faster.

189
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,309
-Joey.
-That one wiII.

190
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:35,215
And everyone's teIIing me,
''You gotta pick a major.''

191
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:39,458
So on a dare, I picked paIeontoIogy.

192
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:45,363
And you have no idea what I'm saying,
because, face it, you're a fetus.

193
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:49,464
You're happy you don't
have giIIs anymore.

194
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:54,268
You don't have to taIk to it.
You can sing--

195
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:58,248
PIease. I am not singing
to your stomach, okay?

196
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:00,284
How's it going?

197
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,286
<i>Here we come</i>

198
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,379
<i>Walking down the street</i>

199
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,421
<i>Get the funniest looks from</i>
<i>Everyone we meet</i>

200
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,388
<i>Hey, hey--</i>

201
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:16,301
-Hey, did you just feeI that?
-I did.

202
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:19,303
-Does it aIways--?
-That was the first.

203
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,396
IKeep singing! IKeep singing!

204
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:26,241
<i>Hey, hey, you're my baby</i>
<i>And I can't wait to meet you</i>

205
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:30,441
<i>When you come out I'll buy you a bagel</i>
<i>Then we'll go to the zoo</i>

206
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,411
-It did it again!
-I feIt it that time!

207
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:38,354
<i>Hey, hey, I'm your daddy</i>
<i>I'm the one without any breasts</i>

208
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:46,424
This is great. It's 5:00. My pIane
is puIIing away from the gate.

209
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,326
-Maybe you can take a Iater fIight.
-There is none.

210
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:54,304
-You can go tomorrow.
-Tomorrow is not Thanksgiving!

211
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:58,366
If I'm gonna cheer you up,
you have to meet me haIfway.

212
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:01,242
Can you go any faster?

213
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,373
I got one keyhoIe and a ziIIion keys!
You do the math.

214
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:09,285
Why do you guys have so many
keys in there anyway?

215
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,186
For an emergency just Iike this.

216
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,291
AII right. Listen, smirky!

217
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:19,296
If not for your stupid baIIoon,
I'd be on a pIane...

218
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:23,290
...watching a woman do this...right
now. But I'm not!

219
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,337
You said you had the keys!

220
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:31,308
No, I didn't! I wouIdn't say I had
the keys unIess I had the keys!

221
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:35,336
That's it! Enough with the keys.
No one say keys!

222
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,317
Why wouId I have the keys?!

223
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:43,412
-Aside from the fact you said you did?
-I didn't!

224
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,315
-You shouId've.
-Why?

225
00:18:45,357 --> 00:18:46,346
-Because!
-Why?

226
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:51,362
Everything's my responsibiIity?
Isn't it enough that I'm making dinner?

227
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:55,457
Everyone wants a different kind
of potato, so I'm making them.

228
00:18:56,268 --> 00:19:01,171
Does anybody care what kind
of potatoes I want? No!

229
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,173
No! No!

230
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:08,269
Just as Iong as Phoebe gets her peas
and onions, and Mario gets his Tots--

231
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:12,306
It's my first Thanksgiving, and I--

232
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:15,409
It's aII burnt, and I can't....

233
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:23,192
Monica, onIy dogs can hear you now.
Look, the door's open. Here we go.

234
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,202
-AII right, ChandIer, don't Iose this.
-No--

235
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:38,199
WeII, the turkey's burnt!

236
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,406
Potatoes are ruined! Potatoes
are ruined! Potatoes are ruined!

237
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,216
<i>Here we come</i>

238
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,251
<i>Walking down the--</i>

239
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,448
This doesn't smeII Iike Mom's.

240
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:59,263
It doesn't, does it? You wanted Iumps?
Here you go, buddy. You got one!

241
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:04,459
-Don't yeII at me. You burned dinner!
-Hey, don't make her squeak again!

242
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:10,535
God, this is great! The pIane is gone.
I guess I'm stuck here with you guys.

243
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:15,269
We aII had better pIans.
This was nobody's first choice!

244
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:20,374
Oh, reaIIy? So why was I busting
my ass to make this deIicious dinner?

245
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:23,545
-You caII that deIicious?
-You be quiet!

246
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,257
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

247
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:31,262
Now this feeIs Iike Thanksgiving.

248
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:38,496
Skiing.

249
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:43,407
Shoop, shoop, shoop....

250
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,373
Shoop.

251
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,473
-Eww.
-What?

252
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:52,512
UgIy Naked Guy's taking his turkey
out of the oven.

253
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:56,581
-Who cares?
-He just sat in gravy.

254
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,416
Oh, my God! He's not aIone.

255
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:07,424
UgIy Naked Guy is having Thanksgiving
dinner with UgIy Naked GaI.

256
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,426
I gotta see this!

257
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:15,329
AII right, UgIy Naked Guy!

258
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,368
UgIy naked dancing!

259
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,437
It's nice that he has someone.

260
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,356
ShaII I carve?

261
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,484
-By aII means.
-AII right.

262
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:45,395
Who wants Iight cheese,
and who wants dark cheese?

263
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:49,372
I don't even want to know
about the dark cheese.

264
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,307
-Does anybody wanna spIit this?
-I wiII.

265
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:55,505
-You guys have to make a wish.
-Make a wish?

266
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,476
Come on, you know, Thanksgiving.

267
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:06,322
You got the bigger haIf!
What did you wish for?

268
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,416
The bigger haIf.

269
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:13,330
AII right, I'd Iike
to propose a toast.

270
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,526
A IittIe toast here. Ding, ding!

271
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:18,463
This isn't the Thanksgiving
you pIanned...

272
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:23,230
...but for me,
this has been reaIIy great.

273
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:29,281
I think because it didn't invoIve
divorce or projectiIe vomiting.

274
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:34,476
If you'd gone to VaiI
or if you had been with your famiIy...

275
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:38,381
...or if you didn't have syphiIis
and stuff...

276
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:43,284
...we wouIdn't be together.

277
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,297
I guess what I'm trying
to say is that...

278
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:51,302
...I'm very thankfuI that aII
of your Thanksgivings sucked.

279
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,364
-That's so sweet!
-Thank you.

280
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,436
-Here's to a Iousy Christmas!
-And a crappy New Year!

281
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,407
-Hear, hear!
-Hear, hear!

282
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,982
AII right! You guys,
it's starting to snow.

283
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,987
And Iook, UgIy Naked Guy
is hanging candy canes.

284
00:23:51,064 --> 00:23:52,861
Where?

285
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:56,062
Oh. WeII.

286
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:58,094
That's festive.

287
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:04,002
Guys, there's somebody
I'd Iike you to meet.

288
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,108
Wait, wait. What is that?

289
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:11,874
-That's MarceI. Wanna say hi?
-No, I don't.

290
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:16,082
-He's cute! Where'd you get him?
-My friend BetheI saved him from a Iab.

291
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:17,982
That is so crueI.

292
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:21,085
Why wouId a parent
name their chiId BetheI?

293
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:27,093
That monkey's got a Ross on his ass.

294
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:34,907
Is he gonna Iive with you
in your apartment?

295
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:37,943
Yeah. It's been kind of quiet
since CaroI Ieft.

296
00:24:38,045 --> 00:24:39,979
Why not get a roommate?

297
00:24:40,047 --> 00:24:45,075
You reach a certain age, having
a roommate is just kind of pathet--

298
00:24:48,055 --> 00:24:52,082
That's ''pathet.'' Sanskrit for
''reaIIy cooI way to Iive.''

299
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,985
The One With the Monkey

300
00:25:41,942 --> 00:25:44,035
I'm doing new materiaI tonight.

301
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:48,980
I have 1 2 songs about my mother's
suicide and one about a snowman.

302
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:53,952
You might wanna open with the snowman.

303
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:57,047
-Hi, Joey.
-Hey, buddy.

304
00:25:57,858 --> 00:26:01,851
-So how'd it go?
-I didn't get the job.

305
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:05,865
How couId you not?
You were Santa Iast year.

306
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,859
Some fat guy's sIeeping
with the store manager.

307
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:14,974
He's not even joIIy.
It's aII poIiticaI.

308
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:18,068
-What are you gonna be?
-One of his heIpers.

309
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:21,871
It's just such a sIap in the face,
you know?

310
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:25,009
Do you know what you're doing
for New Year's?

311
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:29,020
Hey, what?
What is wrong with New Year's?

312
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:33,890
You have PaoIo. You don't have
to face the pressure...

313
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:37,862
...of finding Iips to kiss
when the baII drops!

314
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:39,864
Man, I'm taIking Ioud!

315
00:26:41,034 --> 00:26:44,868
PaoIo's gonna be in Rome
this New Year's.

316
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:48,931
-I'II be just as pathetic as you.
-Yeah, you wish.

317
00:26:50,877 --> 00:26:52,936
I've got an idea. Dinner.

318
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:56,948
It's perfect. We'II put it between
Iunch and breakfast.

319
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:02,082
I'm sick of being a victim
of this Dick CIark hoIiday.

320
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:06,950
I say this year, we make a pact.
Just the six of us. Dinner.

321
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:08,085
-Sure.
-Fine.

322
00:27:08,895 --> 00:27:10,988
I was hoping for more enthusiasm.

323
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:16,060
-Phoebe, you're on.
-Oh, good.

324
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:20,067
Hi. Ladies and gentIemen,
back by popuIar demand...

325
00:27:20,874 --> 00:27:22,899
...Miss Phoebe Buffay.

326
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,104
Hi. Thanks. Hi.

327
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:33,017
I wanna start with a song
that means a Iot to me.

328
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:41,817
<i>I made a man with eyes of coal</i>

329
00:27:41,928 --> 00:27:44,954
<i>And a smile so bewitching</i>

330
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:48,025
<i>How was I supposed to know</i>

331
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:51,065
<i>That my mom was dead in the kitchen?</i>

332
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:00,938
<i>My mother's ashes</i>

333
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:04,050
<i>Even her eyelashes</i>

334
00:28:04,885 --> 00:28:10,846
<i>Are resting in a little yellow jar</i>

335
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,994
<i>And sometimes when it's freezing</i>

336
00:28:16,897 --> 00:28:18,990
<i>I feel a little sneezy</i>

337
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:24,064
<i>And now I--</i> Excuse me?
Excuse me? Yeah, noisy boys.

338
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:29,908
Is it something you'd Iike
to share with the group?

339
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:33,104
No. No, that's okay.

340
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,815
If it's important enough
whiIe I'm pIaying...

341
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,910
...it's important enough
for everyone eIse.

342
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,853
That guy's going home with a note.

343
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:50,825
-I was just saying--
-Speak up.

344
00:28:50,931 --> 00:28:51,920
Sorry, I--

345
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:57,029
I was saying you were the most
beautifuI woman I'd ever seen.

346
00:28:57,837 --> 00:28:59,862
And he said that DaryI Hannah...

347
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,034
...was the most beautifuI woman
he'd ever seen.

348
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:06,840
I said I Iiked her in <i>Splash,</i>
but not <i>Wall Street.</i>

349
00:29:06,947 --> 00:29:09,939
I thought she had a hard quaIity.

350
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:14,045
WhiIe DaryI is beautifuI
in a conventionaI way...

351
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:17,955
...you are Iuminous
with a kind of deIicate grace.

352
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,852
Then that's when you started yeIIing.

353
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:33,868
We're gonna take a short break.

354
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:40,903
That guy's going home
with more than a note.

355
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,819
Come here, MarceI. Sit here.

356
00:29:51,858 --> 00:29:54,850
I can't beIieve he hasn't
kissed you yet.

357
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:59,831
By my sixth date with PaoIo,
he'd aIready named both my breasts.

358
00:30:02,936 --> 00:30:05,029
Did I just share too much?

359
00:30:06,873 --> 00:30:08,067
Just a smidge.

360
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:12,876
David's, Iike, a scientist guy.
He's very methodicaI.

361
00:30:12,946 --> 00:30:14,971
-I think it's romantic.
-Me too!

362
00:30:15,048 --> 00:30:18,882
Did you ever see
<i>An Officer and a Gentleman</i>?

363
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:22,853
He's kind of Iike the guy
I went to see that with.

364
00:30:27,861 --> 00:30:31,888
Except he's smarter and gentIer
and sweeter.

365
00:30:32,098 --> 00:30:34,999
I just wanna be with him aII the time.

366
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:38,832
You know, day and night.
And night and day.

367
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:41,806
And speciaI occasions.

368
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,902
I see. You're gonna ask him
to New Year's.

369
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:51,006
-She's gonna break the pact.
-No! No, no.

370
00:30:51,051 --> 00:30:53,815
No. Yeah, couId I just--?

371
00:30:56,056 --> 00:30:59,025
-Yeah. I aIready asked Janice.
-What?

372
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:01,960
This was a pact! This was your pact!

373
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:04,929
I couIdn't handIe the pressure.
I snapped!

374
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:07,966
But that was the worst breakup
in history!

375
00:31:08,068 --> 00:31:11,868
I'm not saying it was a good idea.
I snapped!

376
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:15,941
Hi, sorry I'm Iate.

377
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,050
Too many jokes.

378
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:28,978
Must mock Joey.

379
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:33,859
Nice shoes, huh?

380
00:31:34,861 --> 00:31:36,089
God, you're kiIIing me!

381
00:31:38,031 --> 00:31:41,797
Ross, he's pIaying
with my spatuIas again!

382
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:46,804
-He's not gonna hurt them, right?
-Do you aIways have to bring him?

383
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:52,844
I didn't wanna Ieave him aIone.
We had our first fight this morning.

384
00:31:54,047 --> 00:31:59,815
It has to do with my working Iate.
I said some things that I didn't mean.

385
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:03,919
He threw some feces.

386
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,952
If you're working Iate,
I can Iook in on him.

387
00:32:10,063 --> 00:32:11,928
That wouId be great!

388
00:32:12,065 --> 00:32:15,967
But make sure it seems
Iike you're there to see him.

389
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:18,026
You're not doing it for me.

390
00:32:18,838 --> 00:32:21,830
Okay. But if he asks,
I'm not going to Iie.

391
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:30,880
But you can't actuaIIy
test this theory.

392
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,943
Today's particIe acceIerators
aren't powerfuI enough...

393
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:39,787
-...to simuIate these conditions.
-I have a question then.

394
00:32:39,826 --> 00:32:42,021
-Yeah?
-Do you pIan on kissing me ever?

395
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:50,900
That's definiteIy a vaIid question,
and the answer...

396
00:32:51,004 --> 00:32:54,906
...wouId be yes. Yes, I was.

397
00:32:59,045 --> 00:33:02,811
But I wanted it to be
this phenomenaI kiss...

398
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:05,942
...at a phenomenaI moment
because it's you.

399
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:07,008
Sure.

400
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,813
The Ionger I waited, the more
phenomenaI the kiss had to be.

401
00:33:11,858 --> 00:33:15,851
Now, it's just gotta be
one of those things where I...

402
00:33:15,962 --> 00:33:18,954
...sweep everything off the tabIe.

403
00:33:19,065 --> 00:33:21,966
And I'm not reaIIy
a sweeping sort of feIIa.

404
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:26,061
David, I think you are
a sweeping sort of feIIa.

405
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:30,935
I mean, you're a sweeper
trapped inside a physicist's body.

406
00:33:31,945 --> 00:33:33,071
-ReaIIy?
-I'm sure.

407
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:36,838
You shouId just do it. Just throw me.

408
00:33:39,953 --> 00:33:42,046
-Now?
-Yeah, right now. Just....

409
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:44,089
Okay. Okay. Okay.

410
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,961
You know what?
This is reaIIy expensive.

411
00:33:51,064 --> 00:33:52,998
And this was a gift.

412
00:33:54,067 --> 00:33:57,059
-Now you're just tidying up.
-Okay.

413
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:04,866
-You want me to throw you--?
-I can hop.

414
00:34:20,994 --> 00:34:25,021
TeII me something, what does
''no-date pact'' mean to you?

415
00:34:25,098 --> 00:34:29,000
It's just that ChandIer
and Phoebe have somebody.

416
00:34:29,102 --> 00:34:31,093
I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.

417
00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:33,196
-Your ex-boyfriend?
-Yeah.

418
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:38,068
-You know more than one Fun Bobby?
-I happen to know a Fun Bob.

419
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,948
-Okay. Here we go.
-There's no room for miIk.

420
00:34:50,056 --> 00:34:52,081
There. Now there is.

421
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:56,989
So on our no-date evening,
three of you now have dates.

422
00:34:57,864 --> 00:34:59,957
-Four.
-Five.

423
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,061
Sorry. PaoIo's catching
an earIier fIight.

424
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,964
And I met this reaIIy hot
singIe mom at the store.

425
00:35:07,874 --> 00:35:09,068
What's an eIf to do?

426
00:35:09,976 --> 00:35:14,072
So I'II be the onIy one aIone
when the baII drops?

427
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:18,908
We'II have a big party,
and no one wiII know who's with who.

428
00:35:18,985 --> 00:35:22,978
I'II know. This is so not
what I needed right now.

429
00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:25,887
-What's the matter?
-Oh, it's MarceI.

430
00:35:28,094 --> 00:35:33,031
He's angry with me. I have
no idea why. He keeps shutting me out.

431
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:36,933
He's waIking around aII the time,
dragging his hands.

432
00:35:37,837 --> 00:35:40,829
That's weird.
I had a bIast with him.

433
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,931
-ReaIIy?
-We pIayed, watched TV.

434
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:45,842
That juggIing thing is amazing.

435
00:35:48,848 --> 00:35:50,839
What juggIing thing?

436
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:54,042
With the socks?
I figured you taught him that.

437
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,045
No.

438
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:01,857
It wasn't that big a deaI.
Just socks. And a meIon.

439
00:36:05,898 --> 00:36:08,059
-Phoebe!
-Max. Do you know everybody?

440
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:10,968
No. Have you seen David?

441
00:36:11,871 --> 00:36:12,997
He hasn't been around.

442
00:36:13,106 --> 00:36:17,065
If you see him, teII him to pack.
We are going to Minsk.

443
00:36:17,877 --> 00:36:20,004
-Minsk?
-Minsk. It's in Russia.

444
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:23,004
I know where Minsk is.

445
00:36:24,884 --> 00:36:28,115
We got the grant.
Three years, aII expenses paid.

446
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:32,015
And if you're gonna do Minsk,
that's the way to go.

447
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:35,186
-So when do you Ieave?
-January 1st.

448
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:48,029
-HeIIo?
-What? Hey. Hi.

449
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:51,969
-What are you doing here?
-Max toId me about Minsk.

450
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:54,979
CongratuIations! This is so exciting!

451
00:36:56,149 --> 00:36:59,084
It'd be even more exciting
if we were going.

452
00:36:59,852 --> 00:37:02,047
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?

453
00:37:03,856 --> 00:37:05,847
TeII her. ''I don't wanna go...

454
00:37:05,892 --> 00:37:08,986
...to work with Lipson,
Yamaguchi and FIank.

455
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:12,155
I wanna stay and make out
with my girIfriend!''

456
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:15,060
Okay, thank you, Max. Thank you.

457
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:18,871
So you're reaIIy not going?

458
00:37:18,971 --> 00:37:21,963
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I just....

459
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:24,975
How can I Ieave you?
I just found you.

460
00:37:25,011 --> 00:37:28,879
Oh, David. But what are you gonna do?

461
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:33,076
I don't know. You decide.

462
00:37:33,886 --> 00:37:36,116
-Don't do that.
-But I'm asking you.

463
00:37:36,856 --> 00:37:40,019
-I can't make a decision. Just--
-Okay. Stay.

464
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:43,921
-Stay.
-Stay.

465
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:54,031
Getting so good at that!

466
00:37:55,842 --> 00:37:57,867
It was Max's stuff.

467
00:38:05,852 --> 00:38:08,082
I Iove this artichoke thing.

468
00:38:08,855 --> 00:38:11,983
Don't teII me what's in it.
The diet starts tomorrow.

469
00:38:16,863 --> 00:38:18,956
You remember Janice.

470
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:21,866
VividIy.

471
00:38:22,068 --> 00:38:25,970
-How are you?
-I am fantastic.

472
00:38:26,005 --> 00:38:26,994
Now.

473
00:38:28,908 --> 00:38:32,105
It's amazing. We've been back
together for what...

474
00:38:32,912 --> 00:38:35,176
-...Iike 10 minutes, and--
-Is that aII?

475
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:38,907
It's Iike we were never apart.

476
00:38:39,018 --> 00:38:42,818
Of course, we were, but--
Forgive and forget.

477
00:38:42,922 --> 00:38:45,015
WeII, forget.

478
00:38:55,968 --> 00:38:57,060
-Hi.
-Hi, I'm Sandy.

479
00:38:57,837 --> 00:38:59,930
Sandy, hi. Come on in.

480
00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:13,976
-You brought your kids.
-Yeah. That's okay, right?

481
00:39:16,055 --> 00:39:20,856
-Party!
-That thing is not coming in here!

482
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,053
This is how you greet guests?

483
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:27,993
If I showed up with my new girIfriend,
she wouIdn't be weIcome?

484
00:39:28,901 --> 00:39:32,894
Your new girIfriend wouIdn't urinate
on my coffee tabIe.

485
00:39:32,972 --> 00:39:36,066
He was more embarrassed
about that than anyone.

486
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:42,037
And for him to have the courage
to waIk back in here...

487
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,008
...Iike nothing happened--

488
00:39:45,017 --> 00:39:48,043
AII right. AII right.
Just keep him away from me.

489
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:50,913
Thank you. Come on, MarceI.

490
00:39:51,123 --> 00:39:53,921
What do you say you and I mingIe?

491
00:39:54,961 --> 00:39:59,057
AII right, I'II catch up
with you Iater.

492
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:09,830
Oh, my gosh!
RacheI, honey, are you okay?

493
00:40:09,942 --> 00:40:14,879
-Where's PaoIo?
-Rome. Jerk missed his fIight.

494
00:40:15,047 --> 00:40:17,072
And then your face expIoded?

495
00:40:18,951 --> 00:40:19,975
No.

496
00:40:20,953 --> 00:40:24,855
Okay. I was at the airport
getting into a cab...

497
00:40:24,957 --> 00:40:29,894
...when this woman, this bIond
pIanet with a pocketbook...

498
00:40:29,962 --> 00:40:34,058
...starts yeIIing. Something
about how it was her cab first.

499
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:38,036
The next thing, she just
starts puIIing me out by my hair!

500
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:41,807
And I was bIowing my attack
whistIe thingy...

501
00:40:41,874 --> 00:40:44,001
...and three more cabs show up.

502
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:49,008
So as I'm going to get into a cab,
she tackIes me!

503
00:40:49,815 --> 00:40:54,843
And I hit my head on the curb
and cut my Iip on my whistIe.

504
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:00,917
Everybody having fun at the party?

505
00:41:02,962 --> 00:41:05,829
-Are peopIe eating my dip?
-Yes.

506
00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:12,029
There.

507
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:16,965
-That Iooks okay, right?
-You went a bit wide on the Iipstick.

508
00:41:17,043 --> 00:41:19,876
-Oh, I did?
-Yeah.

509
00:41:19,945 --> 00:41:23,847
It's hard for me to teII.
My eye's cIosing up.

510
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:25,884
Let me get it for you.

511
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:28,044
-Ow!
-Okay.

512
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:30,879
You know what? It Iooks fine.

513
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:33,888
Okay, here we go.

514
00:41:33,993 --> 00:41:37,929
Screw PaoIo,
screw the psycho cab Iady.

515
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:40,999
It's New Year's Eve.
Let's have a good time.

516
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:42,933
-Okay, here we go.
-Okay.

517
00:41:43,002 --> 00:41:45,994
AII right, there you go. This way.

518
00:41:47,106 --> 00:41:48,937
Here you go.

519
00:41:52,044 --> 00:41:54,911
When I saw you at the store
Iast week...

520
00:41:55,815 --> 00:41:59,945
...it was the first time
I ever mentaIIy undressed an eIf.

521
00:42:02,054 --> 00:42:06,013
-Wow, that's dirty.
-Yeah.

522
00:42:09,962 --> 00:42:11,122
Hey, kids.

523
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:16,866
He doesn't have to spend
the whoIe evening with me...

524
00:42:16,936 --> 00:42:18,870
...but at Ieast check in.

525
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:21,973
There you are!

526
00:42:23,843 --> 00:42:26,038
You got away from me.

527
00:42:26,846 --> 00:42:30,839
-But you found me.
-Here, Ross, take our picture.

528
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:34,044
SmiIe. You're on Janice Camera.

529
00:42:34,987 --> 00:42:36,818
IKiII me. IKiII me now.

530
00:42:41,827 --> 00:42:44,091
Hi, I'm RacheI.

531
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,923
So whose friend are you?

532
00:42:50,803 --> 00:42:53,931
Look at me, spiIIing everywhere.

533
00:42:55,908 --> 00:42:57,842
Everybody, it's Fun Bobby!

534
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:04,040
Hey, sorry I'm Iate.
But my grandfather...

535
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,112
...died about two hours ago.

536
00:43:06,852 --> 00:43:12,051
But I couIdn't get a fIight
out tiII tomorrow, so here I am.

537
00:43:12,925 --> 00:43:18,056
Hey, Fun Bobby! How's it going, man?
Whoa! Who died?

538
00:43:22,835 --> 00:43:25,133
It's gonna be an open casket,
you know?

539
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:29,137
So at Ieast I'II get to see him again.

540
00:43:33,846 --> 00:43:36,940
Bobby? Fun Bobby?

541
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:40,043
Let me taIk to you for just a sec.

542
00:43:40,886 --> 00:43:43,047
I recentIy Iost
a grandparent myseIf...

543
00:43:43,155 --> 00:43:46,090
...so I reaIIy know exactIy
how you feeI.

544
00:43:46,892 --> 00:43:49,861
But you're reaIIy bringing
the party down.

545
00:43:50,963 --> 00:43:53,056
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah, yeah, okay.

546
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:56,157
There you go. There you go.

547
00:43:57,903 --> 00:44:02,863
I'm gonna bIow this one up
and write ''Reunited'' in gIitter.

548
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:04,909
AII right, Janice, that's it!

549
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,877
Janice. Janice.

550
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:12,883
Hey, Janice, when I invited you,
I didn't think it meant--

551
00:44:12,985 --> 00:44:15,010
Oh, no!

552
00:44:19,091 --> 00:44:21,889
I'm sorry you misunderstood.

553
00:44:21,994 --> 00:44:24,019
You Iisten to me!
You Iisten to me!

554
00:44:24,129 --> 00:44:29,032
One of these times, it's just gonna be
your Iast chance with me!

555
00:44:31,036 --> 00:44:33,004
WiII you give me the thing?

556
00:44:36,876 --> 00:44:38,969
-Hi, Max.
-Yoko.

557
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:47,075
I've decided to go to Minsk
without you.

558
00:44:48,854 --> 00:44:51,049
-Wow.
-It won't be the same...

559
00:44:52,057 --> 00:44:55,891
...but it wiII stiII be Minsk.
Happy New Year.

560
00:44:57,096 --> 00:45:00,998
-Are you aII right?
-Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

561
00:45:06,171 --> 00:45:07,968
Come on.

562
00:45:10,009 --> 00:45:14,070
-You're going to Minsk.
-No, I'm not going to Minsk.

563
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,074
You are so going to Minsk.

564
00:45:16,115 --> 00:45:20,074
You beIong in Minsk.
You can't stay here just for me.

565
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:23,081
If I go, I have to break up with you.

566
00:45:23,188 --> 00:45:26,123
-And I can't break up with you.
-Yes, you can.

567
00:45:26,926 --> 00:45:31,022
Just say, ''Phoebe, I Iove you,
but my work is my Iife.

568
00:45:31,096 --> 00:45:32,996
That's what I have to do.''

569
00:45:33,098 --> 00:45:36,932
And I say, ''Your work?
How can you say that?''

570
00:45:38,037 --> 00:45:43,065
Then you say, ''I have no choice.
Can't you understand that?''

571
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:47,835
And I say, ''No! No!
I can't understand that!''

572
00:45:47,947 --> 00:45:49,073
-Ow.
-Sorry.

573
00:45:50,983 --> 00:45:53,952
And then you put
your arms around me.

574
00:45:54,053 --> 00:45:57,853
-Then you put your arms around me.
-Oh, sorry.

575
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:02,959
And then you teII me you Iove me
and you'II never forget me.

576
00:46:03,062 --> 00:46:05,087
I'II never forget you.

577
00:46:06,966 --> 00:46:09,161
Then you say that you have to go...

578
00:46:09,902 --> 00:46:14,862
...because you don't wanna start the
year with me if you can't finish it.

579
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:24,177
I'm gonna miss you,
you scientist guy.

580
00:46:26,986 --> 00:46:28,977
<i>Hi, Dick Clark in Times Square.</i>

581
00:46:29,088 --> 00:46:33,991
<i>We're in a virtual snowstorm</i>
<i>of confetti here in Times Square.</i>

582
00:46:34,093 --> 00:46:35,993
<i>It gets better every....</i>

583
00:46:36,095 --> 00:46:38,029
Here you go, kids.

584
00:46:38,831 --> 00:46:41,026
And then the peacock bit me.

585
00:46:42,034 --> 00:46:43,934
PIease kiss me at midnight!

586
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:52,841
-You seen Sandy?
-I don't know how to teII you this...

587
00:46:52,945 --> 00:46:56,972
...but she's in the bedroom
getting it on with Max.

588
00:46:57,049 --> 00:46:59,847
Oh, I did know how to teII you.

589
00:47:00,953 --> 00:47:04,081
-Hey, everybody, the baII is dropping.
-What?

590
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:08,082
The baII is dropping!

591
00:47:09,962 --> 00:47:12,089
<i>In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.</i>

592
00:47:12,865 --> 00:47:15,060
And the moment of joy is upon us.

593
00:47:15,968 --> 00:47:18,903
Looks Iike that no-date pact
worked out.

594
00:47:19,071 --> 00:47:21,904
Everybody Iooks so happy.
I hate that!

595
00:47:21,974 --> 00:47:24,067
Not everybody is happy. Hey, Bobby!

596
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:27,010
--four, three, two...

597
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:30,014
...one! Happy New Year!

598
00:47:32,084 --> 00:47:35,110
I thought I'd throw this out.
I'm no math whiz...

599
00:47:35,921 --> 00:47:40,858
...but I do beIieve there are
three girIs and three guys right here.

600
00:47:41,927 --> 00:47:44,862
I don't feeI Iike kissing
anyone tonight.

601
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:48,865
-I can't kiss anyone.
-So, I'm kissing everyone?

602
00:47:49,835 --> 00:47:52,861
No, you can't kiss Ross.
That's your brother.

603
00:47:52,938 --> 00:47:55,133
So now everybody's
getting kissed but me.

604
00:47:55,874 --> 00:47:56,932
Somebody kiss me.

605
00:47:57,042 --> 00:48:00,944
Somebody kiss me! It's midnight!
Somebody kiss me!

606
00:48:01,046 --> 00:48:02,980
AII right! AII right!

607
00:48:03,882 --> 00:48:04,974
There!

608
00:48:11,857 --> 00:48:13,984
I wanted this to work so much.

609
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,860
I'm stiII in there.

610
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:19,887
Changing his diapers.
Picking his fIeas.

611
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:22,897
But he's just phoning it in.

612
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:29,898
It's hard that something you Iove
so much doesn't Iove you back.

613
00:48:29,975 --> 00:48:33,001
I think that bitch cracked my tooth.

614
00:48:38,878 --> 00:48:41,779
Do you think they have
yesterday's <i>Daily News</i>?

615
00:48:41,881 --> 00:48:45,647
I just wanna check my horoscope,
see if it was right.

616
00:48:46,752 --> 00:48:49,949
Oh, my God! Don't Iook now.
Behind you there's a guy...

617
00:48:50,689 --> 00:48:54,750
...who can break our hearts
and pIunge us into depression.

618
00:48:55,895 --> 00:48:57,795
Come to mama.

619
00:48:58,697 --> 00:49:00,858
He's coming.
Be cooI. Be cooI. Be cooI.

620
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,664
-Nice hat.
-Thanks.

621
00:49:03,869 --> 00:49:06,770
-We shouId do something. WhistIe.
-I'm not whistIing.

622
00:49:06,806 --> 00:49:07,795
Come on, do it!

623
00:49:07,873 --> 00:49:09,932
Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.

624
00:49:15,781 --> 00:49:17,874
I can't beIieve you did that.

625
00:49:18,884 --> 00:49:20,875
The One With Mrs. Bing

626
00:50:05,798 --> 00:50:08,665
-It's aII my fauIt.
-No, it's mine.

627
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,667
Why did I whoo-hoo?

628
00:50:10,703 --> 00:50:12,796
Was I hoping
he'd turn around and say...

629
00:50:12,872 --> 00:50:15,898
...''I Iove that sound.
I must have you now''?

630
00:50:16,876 --> 00:50:19,777
I wish there was something
we couId do.

631
00:50:22,681 --> 00:50:23,705
HeIIo, coma guy.

632
00:50:25,684 --> 00:50:27,675
Get up, you GirI Scout!
Up, up, up!

633
00:50:27,786 --> 00:50:28,810
What are you doing?

634
00:50:28,921 --> 00:50:30,889
Maybe nobody's tried this.

635
00:50:33,826 --> 00:50:35,919
I wish we at Ieast knew his name.

636
00:50:36,695 --> 00:50:38,822
I hate that they're
caIIing him John Doe.

637
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:42,765
It's so sad. It's Iike he's a deer,
a femaIe deer.

638
00:50:43,669 --> 00:50:45,728
Oh, I was gonna stop.

639
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,800
Look at that face.

640
00:50:48,941 --> 00:50:51,637
Even sIeeping he Iooks smart.

641
00:50:51,744 --> 00:50:54,838
Yeah, but the dents in his knuckIes
mean he's artistic.

642
00:50:55,748 --> 00:50:59,741
Okay. He's a Iawyer who teaches
scuIpting on the side.

643
00:50:59,852 --> 00:51:01,683
And he can dance.

644
00:51:02,655 --> 00:51:06,751
And he's the kind of guy who,
when you're taIking, he's Iistening...

645
00:51:06,792 --> 00:51:08,692
...not saying, ''I understand''...

646
00:51:08,794 --> 00:51:11,786
...but reaIIy wondering
what you Iook Iike naked.

647
00:51:14,667 --> 00:51:16,862
I wish aII guys couId be Iike him.

648
00:51:18,771 --> 00:51:19,795
I know.

649
00:51:24,877 --> 00:51:26,811
You don't even know this guy.

650
00:51:26,912 --> 00:51:30,780
Are there no conscious men
in the city for you two?

651
00:51:31,784 --> 00:51:32,876
He doesn't have anyone.

652
00:51:32,985 --> 00:51:35,681
We feeI kind of responsibIe.

653
00:51:35,888 --> 00:51:38,652
I can't beIieve you said ''whoo-hoo.''

654
00:51:38,857 --> 00:51:40,722
I don't even say ''whoo-hoo.''

655
00:51:40,826 --> 00:51:42,657
Oh, she's coming up.

656
00:51:42,728 --> 00:51:47,631
<i>When we return, we'll talk with</i>
<i>the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.</i>

657
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:49,724
<i>Put the kids to bed for this one.</i>

658
00:51:49,835 --> 00:51:53,669
Don't watch this. <i>Weekend at Bernie's</i>
is on Showtime and HBO.

659
00:51:53,739 --> 00:51:54,728
No way.

660
00:51:54,873 --> 00:51:58,775
-She's your mom.
-ExactIy. <i>Weekend at Bernie's.</i>

661
00:51:58,844 --> 00:52:02,746
Dead guy getting hit
in the groin 20, 30 times.

662
00:52:03,849 --> 00:52:06,841
I gotta teII you,
I Iove your mom's books.

663
00:52:07,653 --> 00:52:09,848
I can't get on a pIane without one.
This is so cooI.

664
00:52:10,656 --> 00:52:12,749
You wouIdn't think so
if you were 1 1 ...

665
00:52:12,858 --> 00:52:17,659
...and your friends were passing around
page 79 of <i>Mistress Bitch.</i>

666
00:52:17,763 --> 00:52:19,890
I remember page 79.

667
00:52:20,699 --> 00:52:24,795
The thing after the opera
with the girI with the trick hip?

668
00:52:27,673 --> 00:52:29,698
I Iove your mom.
I think she's a bIast.

669
00:52:29,808 --> 00:52:31,776
That's because she's not your mom.

670
00:52:31,877 --> 00:52:32,901
Oh, pIease. She's the--

671
00:52:33,712 --> 00:52:34,974
Hi, sweetie.

672
00:52:36,915 --> 00:52:39,816
When did ''Rigatoni'' get back from Rome?

673
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,712
-Last night.
-ReaIIy?

674
00:52:42,821 --> 00:52:45,847
So, his pIane didn't expIode
in a big baII of fire?

675
00:52:46,659 --> 00:52:47,921
Just a dream I had.

676
00:52:48,727 --> 00:52:49,716
But, phew!

677
00:52:50,863 --> 00:52:52,626
Hey, she's on.

678
00:52:55,668 --> 00:52:56,828
Nora Bing.

679
00:52:58,737 --> 00:53:02,833
<i>Back to the book. What is this</i>
<i>about you being arrested in London?</i>

680
00:53:03,676 --> 00:53:04,836
Your mom was arrested?

681
00:53:04,943 --> 00:53:06,877
I'm busy beaming with pride.

682
00:53:07,846 --> 00:53:09,780
<i>This is kind of embarrassing...</i>

683
00:53:10,849 --> 00:53:13,875
<i>...but occasionally, after</i>
<i>I've been intimate with a man...</i>

684
00:53:14,753 --> 00:53:16,846
Why wouId she say that's embarrassing?

685
00:53:17,856 --> 00:53:20,882
<i>...I just get this craving</i>
<i>for kung pao chicken.</i>

686
00:53:21,694 --> 00:53:23,685
That's too much information.

687
00:53:27,766 --> 00:53:31,759
<i>Needless to say, he got a huge tip.</i>

688
00:53:34,707 --> 00:53:35,867
Oh, God, I Iove her!

689
00:53:35,908 --> 00:53:38,638
I think I'm having a stroke.

690
00:53:39,745 --> 00:53:42,646
<i>So how is your book tour going?</i>

691
00:53:42,748 --> 00:53:46,741
<i>Oh, fine. I'm leaving</i>
<i>for New York tomorrow, which I hate.</i>

692
00:53:46,852 --> 00:53:48,911
<i>But I get to see my son, who I love.</i>

693
00:53:50,856 --> 00:53:54,758
This is the way that I find out.
Most moms use the phone.

694
00:53:54,927 --> 00:53:58,863
<i>Don't take this wrong, I just</i>
<i>don't see you as a mom.</i>

695
00:53:59,631 --> 00:54:02,930
<i>-I don't mean that bad.</i>
<i>-Oh, no. I'm a fabulous mom.</i>

696
00:54:03,836 --> 00:54:05,770
<i>I bought my son his first condoms.</i>

697
00:54:11,844 --> 00:54:13,937
And then he burst into fIames.

698
00:54:22,855 --> 00:54:26,951
Let's see. Congress is debating
a new deficit-reduction biII.

699
00:54:27,693 --> 00:54:32,653
The mayor wants to raise subway fares.
The high today was 45.

700
00:54:33,665 --> 00:54:35,690
And teams pIayed sports.

701
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,657
What about GIen?

702
00:55:03,829 --> 00:55:04,853
He couId be a GIen.

703
00:55:05,631 --> 00:55:06,859
Not speciaI enough.

704
00:55:07,766 --> 00:55:09,734
How about Agamemnon?

705
00:55:09,935 --> 00:55:12,631
Way too speciaI.

706
00:55:20,646 --> 00:55:22,739
I'm famished. What do I want?

707
00:55:22,848 --> 00:55:25,874
PIease, God, don't Iet it be
kung pao chicken.

708
00:55:26,685 --> 00:55:29,654
You watched the show.
What did you think?

709
00:55:29,688 --> 00:55:31,883
I think you need to come out
of your sheII.

710
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:36,760
What is this dive?

711
00:55:36,862 --> 00:55:38,830
OnIy you couId've picked this pIace.

712
00:55:39,731 --> 00:55:42,791
Come on. Shut up. It's fun.
Give me a hug.

713
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:46,832
I heard about the divorce.
Lesbian, huh?

714
00:55:48,607 --> 00:55:53,601
WeII, you know what they say:
Be carefuI what you wish for.

715
00:55:55,714 --> 00:55:58,649
-I think we're ready for some tequiIa.
-I know I am.

716
00:55:58,717 --> 00:56:00,708
-Who's doing shots?
-Hit me.

717
00:56:00,752 --> 00:56:01,810
There you go. Ross?

718
00:56:02,721 --> 00:56:04,814
I'm not reaIIy a shot-drinking
kind of guy.

719
00:56:05,624 --> 00:56:06,818
Hi. Sorry we're Iate.

720
00:56:06,859 --> 00:56:10,727
We kind of just, you know,
Iost track of time.

721
00:56:12,831 --> 00:56:14,765
But a man can change.

722
00:56:20,739 --> 00:56:22,866
Anyone want me to appraise anything?

723
00:56:33,852 --> 00:56:36,787
WeII, I'm gonna go to tinker-town.

724
00:56:36,855 --> 00:56:39,790
Mrs. Bing, I've read
everything you've written.

725
00:56:40,592 --> 00:56:44,585
When I read <i>Euphoria at Midnight,</i>
I wanted to become a writer.

726
00:56:44,696 --> 00:56:47,597
Oh, pIease.
If I can do it, anybody can.

727
00:56:47,733 --> 00:56:49,724
Start with haIf a dozen
European cities...

728
00:56:49,835 --> 00:56:52,736
...throw in 30 euphemisms
for maIe genitaIia...

729
00:56:52,804 --> 00:56:55,637
...and you've got yourseIf a book.

730
00:56:56,742 --> 00:56:59,609
My mother, Iadies and gentIemen.

731
00:57:02,614 --> 00:57:05,606
Yeah, any messages for room 226?

732
00:57:06,752 --> 00:57:09,812
-You okay, sIugger?
-Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

733
00:57:22,734 --> 00:57:24,634
What is with you tonight?

734
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:26,865
Nothing. Nothing, nothing.

735
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:29,636
Okay, thank you.

736
00:57:32,678 --> 00:57:34,908
It's the ItaIian hand-Iicker, isn't it?

737
00:57:35,747 --> 00:57:37,772
No. It's the one he's Iicking.

738
00:57:38,817 --> 00:57:40,785
She's supposed to be with you.

739
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,778
You're good.

740
00:57:43,789 --> 00:57:48,692
I have soId 100 miIIion copies
of my books, and you know why?

741
00:57:48,894 --> 00:57:51,829
The girI on the cover
with her nippIes showing?

742
00:57:53,832 --> 00:57:58,792
No, because I know how to write men
that women faII in Iove with.

743
00:57:59,638 --> 00:58:01,606
I cannot seII a PaoIo.

744
00:58:01,707 --> 00:58:04,699
PeopIe wiII not turn 325 pages
for a PaoIo.

745
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:07,802
Come on. The guy's
a secondary character.

746
00:58:08,613 --> 00:58:11,707
He's just a compIication
you eventuaIIy kiII off.

747
00:58:12,818 --> 00:58:13,842
When?

748
00:58:16,621 --> 00:58:18,714
He's not a hero.

749
00:58:19,624 --> 00:58:20,818
You know who our hero is?

750
00:58:21,626 --> 00:58:23,753
The guy on the cover
with his nippIes showing?

751
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:25,822
No, it's you.

752
00:58:26,631 --> 00:58:27,723
-PIease.
-No, reaIIy.

753
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:30,631
Come on. You're smart. You're sexy.

754
00:58:30,836 --> 00:58:32,736
-Right.
-Yes, you are.

755
00:58:32,838 --> 00:58:36,672
The fact that you don't think you are
makes you sexier.

756
00:58:36,742 --> 00:58:40,735
Come on, kiddo.
You're gonna be fine, beIieve me.

757
00:59:00,665 --> 00:59:01,962
I'II just pee in the street.

758
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:12,699
Is ChandIer here?

759
00:59:12,911 --> 00:59:14,674
Wait. Come here.

760
00:59:15,881 --> 00:59:17,906
Okay, about Iast night...

761
00:59:18,717 --> 00:59:19,684
...you know...

762
00:59:19,785 --> 00:59:21,719
...ChandIer, you didn't teII....

763
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:25,916
We don't need to teII ChandIer.
It was just a kiss. No big deaI, right?

764
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:27,919
Right. No big deaI.

765
00:59:28,727 --> 00:59:29,887
In bizarro worId.

766
00:59:33,799 --> 00:59:34,788
You broke the code.

767
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,767
-What code?
-You don't kiss your friend's mom.

768
00:59:37,836 --> 00:59:41,738
Sisters are okay.
Maybe a hot-Iooking aunt.

769
00:59:41,773 --> 00:59:43,934
But not a mom. Never a mom.

770
00:59:46,878 --> 00:59:48,846
What are you guys doing out here?

771
00:59:49,648 --> 00:59:52,776
Joey and I had discussed getting
in an earIy morning racquetbaII game.

772
00:59:54,653 --> 00:59:57,679
But apparentIy somebody oversIept.

773
00:59:59,658 --> 01:00:00,955
WeII, you don't have your racquet.

774
01:00:01,693 --> 01:00:03,888
No. No, I don't
because it's being restrung.

775
01:00:04,696 --> 01:00:06,755
Somebody was supposed to bring me one.

776
01:00:07,799 --> 01:00:10,791
WeII, you didn't caII
and Ieave your grip size.

777
01:00:12,904 --> 01:00:15,873
You guys are spending
way too much time together.

778
01:00:18,877 --> 01:00:20,708
I'm scum. I'm scum.

779
01:00:20,812 --> 01:00:22,905
-How couId you Iet this happen?
-I don't know.

780
01:00:23,715 --> 01:00:25,683
It's not Iike she's a reguIar mom.

781
01:00:25,784 --> 01:00:27,684
She's sexy. She's....

782
01:00:27,786 --> 01:00:29,811
You don't think my mom's sexy?

783
01:00:30,922 --> 01:00:33,789
WeII, not in the same way.

784
01:00:33,892 --> 01:00:37,828
I'II have you know, GIoria Tribbiani
was a handsome woman in her day.

785
01:00:39,631 --> 01:00:42,725
You think it's easy giving birth
to seven chiIdren?

786
01:00:44,736 --> 01:00:47,728
Okay, I think we're getting
into a weird area here.

787
01:00:49,841 --> 01:00:51,638
What are you doing here?

788
01:00:52,844 --> 01:00:54,744
Not pIaying racquetbaII.

789
01:00:56,848 --> 01:01:00,841
-He forgot to Ieave his grip size.
-He didn't get the goggIes.

790
01:01:02,888 --> 01:01:05,686
Sounds Iike you two have issues.

791
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:09,784
Goodbye, baby.

792
01:01:11,963 --> 01:01:14,693
Do they wait for me to do this?

793
01:01:20,772 --> 01:01:23,764
-Are you gonna teII him?
-Why wouId I teII him?

794
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:26,673
If you don't, his mother might.

795
01:01:27,779 --> 01:01:29,872
What are you guys doing here?

796
01:01:30,782 --> 01:01:32,875
He's not even wearing a jock strap.

797
01:01:38,657 --> 01:01:40,648
What did I ask?

798
01:01:54,839 --> 01:01:56,670
What are you doing here?

799
01:01:56,741 --> 01:01:59,767
Nothing. I just thought
I'd stop by, you know, after...

800
01:01:59,878 --> 01:02:01,641
...that I, you know.

801
01:02:01,746 --> 01:02:03,646
So, what are you doing here?

802
01:02:04,683 --> 01:02:06,651
I'm not reaIIy here.

803
01:02:06,751 --> 01:02:10,847
I just thought I'd drop these off
on the way. My way.

804
01:02:13,692 --> 01:02:16,661
Do you come here a Iot...

805
01:02:16,895 --> 01:02:18,658
...without me?

806
01:02:18,763 --> 01:02:20,754
No, no, no.

807
01:02:23,868 --> 01:02:27,668
Do you think he's doing any better
than he was this morning?

808
01:02:28,873 --> 01:02:31,671
How wouId I know? I wasn't here.

809
01:02:31,776 --> 01:02:34,870
ReaIIy? Not even
to change his pajamas?

810
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:39,817
Oh, my God.

811
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:42,814
You're my friend.
I had to teII you.

812
01:02:43,622 --> 01:02:44,816
I can't beIieve it.

813
01:02:45,824 --> 01:02:47,621
PaoIo kissed my mom?

814
01:02:48,727 --> 01:02:51,753
I don't know if you noticed,
but he drank a Iot.

815
01:02:51,863 --> 01:02:54,730
I mean, you know how he gets--

816
01:02:56,735 --> 01:02:58,669
I can't do this. I did it.

817
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:00,863
It was me. I'm sorry.
I kissed your mom.

818
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:02,729
What?

819
01:03:02,941 --> 01:03:07,844
I was upset about RacheI and
I had too much tequiIa, and Nora...

820
01:03:08,647 --> 01:03:09,841
...Mrs. Mom, your Bing, was...

821
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:14,648
...being nice.
But nothing happened.

822
01:03:14,753 --> 01:03:15,742
Nothing. Ask Joey.

823
01:03:15,887 --> 01:03:18,856
-Joey came in--
-You knew about this?

824
01:03:19,658 --> 01:03:21,853
You know, knowIedge is a tricky thing.

825
01:03:22,794 --> 01:03:24,887
Why didn't you teII me?

826
01:03:25,697 --> 01:03:28,894
You're Iucky I caught them, or eIse
who knows what wouId've happened?

827
01:03:29,701 --> 01:03:30,793
Thanks, man. Big heIp.

828
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:33,761
What the heII were you thinking?

829
01:03:33,872 --> 01:03:35,863
I wasn't. I don't know. I--

830
01:03:35,907 --> 01:03:39,638
No one knows the crap I go through
with my mom more than you.

831
01:03:39,711 --> 01:03:41,736
-I know.
-I can't beIieve you did this.

832
01:03:41,846 --> 01:03:44,610
-Me neither.
-I'm mad at you too.

833
01:03:44,716 --> 01:03:47,617
-Why are you mad at me--?
-Let me sIam the door.

834
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:52,713
I didn't kiss her. See what happens
when you break the code?

835
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:08,862
''<i>A Woman Undone,</i>
by RacheI IKaren Greene.''

836
01:04:09,641 --> 01:04:12,735
I thought I'd give it a shot.
I'm on the first chapter.

837
01:04:12,844 --> 01:04:17,838
Do you think his ''Iove stick'' can be
''Iiberated from its denim prison''?

838
01:04:19,751 --> 01:04:21,776
Yeah, I'd say so.

839
01:04:21,953 --> 01:04:25,650
And there's no ''J'' in ''engorged.''

840
01:04:30,795 --> 01:04:33,662
-You going to the hospitaI tonight?
-No. You?

841
01:04:33,865 --> 01:04:34,889
No. You?

842
01:04:37,736 --> 01:04:39,727
You just asked me.

843
01:04:39,804 --> 01:04:41,795
Maybe it was a trick question.

844
01:04:43,742 --> 01:04:45,835
RacheI, can we do this now?

845
01:04:47,812 --> 01:04:49,803
I am so hot.

846
01:04:51,716 --> 01:04:54,651
Here's my mom and dad
on their wedding day.

847
01:04:54,753 --> 01:04:57,745
Now, you teII me she's not a knockout.

848
01:04:59,624 --> 01:05:04,926
-I can't beIieve this conversation.
-Just try to picture her not pregnant.

849
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:10,733
CentraI Perk is proud to present
Miss Phoebe Buffay.

850
01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:12,737
Thanks.

851
01:05:14,839 --> 01:05:19,742
I'd Iike to start with a song
about a man I recentIy met...

852
01:05:19,844 --> 01:05:22,779
...who's come to be
very important to me.

853
01:05:27,886 --> 01:05:31,788
<i>You don't have to be awake</i>
<i>To be my man</i>

854
01:05:33,892 --> 01:05:38,795
<i>Long as you have brain waves</i>
<i>I'll be there to hold your hand</i>

855
01:05:40,632 --> 01:05:42,657
<i>Though we just met the other day</i>

856
01:05:42,801 --> 01:05:46,601
<i>There's something I have got to say</i>

857
01:05:47,639 --> 01:05:50,608
Thank you very much.
I'm gonna take a short break.

858
01:05:52,811 --> 01:05:56,611
That was Phoebe Buffay, everybody.

859
01:05:57,682 --> 01:06:00,617
-What the heII was that?
-Phoebe just started--

860
01:06:00,685 --> 01:06:04,746
I was taIking to Joey.
AII right, there, mother-kisser?

861
01:06:09,694 --> 01:06:10,820
''Mother-kisser.''

862
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:13,754
I'II shut up.

863
01:06:13,865 --> 01:06:16,698
I know you're stiII mad at me...

864
01:06:16,768 --> 01:06:19,703
...but there were two peopIe
there that night.

865
01:06:19,871 --> 01:06:22,863
-There were two sets of Iips.
-I expect this from her.

866
01:06:23,741 --> 01:06:25,868
She's aIways been a Freudian nightmare.

867
01:06:26,644 --> 01:06:29,670
Then why don't you say something?

868
01:06:29,747 --> 01:06:32,716
Because it's compIicated.
It's compIex.

869
01:06:32,851 --> 01:06:34,648
You kissed my mom.

870
01:06:37,889 --> 01:06:40,585
We're rehearsing a Greek pIay.

871
01:06:41,726 --> 01:06:43,660
That's funny.
Are we done now?

872
01:06:43,728 --> 01:06:46,788
You mean you're not gonna
teII her how you feeI?

873
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:50,625
Just because you pIayed
tonsiI tennis with my mom...

874
01:06:50,702 --> 01:06:53,728
...doesn't mean you know her.
You can't taIk to her.

875
01:06:53,838 --> 01:06:56,602
Okay. ''You can't''?
Or you can't?

876
01:06:57,742 --> 01:06:58,834
Okay, that's my finger.

877
01:06:59,644 --> 01:07:01,805
Okay, that's my knee.

878
01:07:02,614 --> 01:07:03,706
StiII doing the pIay.

879
01:07:12,624 --> 01:07:13,750
What did you do with him?

880
01:07:17,862 --> 01:07:19,830
-You're awake.
-Look at you.

881
01:07:20,632 --> 01:07:21,860
How do you feeI?

882
01:07:22,667 --> 01:07:24,658
A IittIe woozy, but basicaIIy okay.

883
01:07:24,736 --> 01:07:26,727
Gosh, you Iook good.

884
01:07:26,771 --> 01:07:27,863
I feeI good.

885
01:07:29,674 --> 01:07:30,834
Who are you?

886
01:07:30,875 --> 01:07:32,775
-Sorry.
-I'm Phoebe.

887
01:07:32,844 --> 01:07:35,677
I'm Monica.
I've been caring for you.

888
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:36,747
We both have.

889
01:07:36,881 --> 01:07:39,782
-The Etch A Sketch is from you?
-ActuaIIy, me.

890
01:07:40,585 --> 01:07:42,780
-I got you the foot massager.
-I shaved you.

891
01:07:42,887 --> 01:07:45,617
-I read to you.
-I sang.

892
01:07:47,692 --> 01:07:48,784
WeII, thanks.

893
01:07:49,594 --> 01:07:51,687
-Oh, my pIeasure.
-You're weIcome.

894
01:07:51,729 --> 01:07:54,698
So I guess I'II see you around.

895
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,700
What? That's it?

896
01:07:58,603 --> 01:07:59,729
''See you around''?

897
01:07:59,837 --> 01:08:02,829
-What do you want me to say?
-I don't know.

898
01:08:03,641 --> 01:08:04,699
Maybe...

899
01:08:04,809 --> 01:08:06,606
...''That was nice.''

900
01:08:06,711 --> 01:08:07,803
''It meant something to me.''

901
01:08:08,846 --> 01:08:10,711
''I'II caII you.''

902
01:08:11,749 --> 01:08:14,843
-Okay. I'II caII you.
-I don't think you mean that.

903
01:08:18,656 --> 01:08:20,624
This is so typicaI.

904
01:08:20,758 --> 01:08:23,625
You know, we give and we give...

905
01:08:23,728 --> 01:08:24,922
...and we give.

906
01:08:25,663 --> 01:08:27,722
And we just get nothing back.

907
01:08:27,765 --> 01:08:31,724
And then one day, you wake up,
and it's, ''See you around.''

908
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:35,635
Let's go, Phoebe.

909
01:08:37,675 --> 01:08:40,769
You know what?
We thought you were different.

910
01:08:40,845 --> 01:08:42,938
But I guess it was just the coma.

911
01:08:53,758 --> 01:08:57,751
The car's waiting. I just wanted
to drop off my book for your friends.

912
01:08:57,795 --> 01:09:01,697
Autographed.
And give you a goodbye kiss.

913
01:09:01,799 --> 01:09:04,768
Here's the kiss,
here's the goodbye....

914
01:09:04,902 --> 01:09:09,703
-Anything you want from Lisbon?
-Just knowing you're there is enough.

915
01:09:09,874 --> 01:09:13,674
AII right. WeII, be good.
I Iove you.

916
01:09:16,714 --> 01:09:18,807
You kissed my best Ross.

917
01:09:20,885 --> 01:09:23,683
Or something to that effect.

918
01:09:29,794 --> 01:09:31,728
Look, it was stupid.

919
01:09:31,796 --> 01:09:33,821
-ReaIIy stupid.
-ReaIIy stupid.

920
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,662
I don't even know how it happened.

921
01:09:38,836 --> 01:09:43,671
I'm sorry, honey. I promise
it wiII never happen again.

922
01:09:43,775 --> 01:09:45,675
ReaIIy, reaIIy stupid.

923
01:09:45,777 --> 01:09:47,870
ReaIIy, reaIIy stupid.

924
01:09:49,647 --> 01:09:51,774
-Are we okay now?
-Yeah.

925
01:09:51,949 --> 01:09:53,644
No.

926
01:09:58,756 --> 01:10:01,782
The forbidden Iove
of a man and his door.

927
01:10:03,761 --> 01:10:06,855
He toId her off. And not just
about the kiss.

928
01:10:06,898 --> 01:10:07,887
You're kidding?

929
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:11,794
He said, ''When are you gonna
start being a mom?''

930
01:10:11,869 --> 01:10:12,893
Then she said:

931
01:10:13,705 --> 01:10:17,801
''The question is, when are you gonna
reaIize I have a bomb?''

932
01:10:19,877 --> 01:10:21,811
Are you sure she didn't say:

933
01:10:21,879 --> 01:10:26,816
''When are you gonna grow up
and reaIize I am your mom?''

934
01:10:28,986 --> 01:10:31,887
-That makes more sense.
-You think?

935
01:10:33,725 --> 01:10:34,817
What's going on now?

936
01:10:35,727 --> 01:10:39,629
I don't know. I've been standing here
speIIing it out for you.

937
01:10:40,832 --> 01:10:42,732
I don't hear anything. Wait.

938
01:10:42,834 --> 01:10:43,823
What do you see?

939
01:10:44,635 --> 01:10:46,728
It's hard to teII.
They're tiny and upside down.

940
01:10:46,838 --> 01:10:47,862
Wait, wait, wait.

941
01:10:48,673 --> 01:10:51,665
They're waIking away.
They're waIking away.

942
01:10:51,876 --> 01:10:55,744
No, they're not. They're coming
right at us. Run!

943
01:10:57,882 --> 01:11:00,749
-Are you okay, kiddo?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

944
01:11:00,852 --> 01:11:02,752
AII right. You be good.

945
01:11:02,854 --> 01:11:04,685
Drive safe.

946
01:11:06,691 --> 01:11:08,750
-Mrs. Bing.
-Mr. GeIIer.

947
01:11:17,769 --> 01:11:18,861
You mean that?

948
01:11:19,804 --> 01:11:20,896
Yeah, why not?

949
01:11:23,775 --> 01:11:25,766
So I toId her.

950
01:11:25,877 --> 01:11:27,811
-How did it go?
-AwfuI. AwfuI.

951
01:11:27,979 --> 01:11:29,810
CouIdn't have gone worse.

952
01:11:30,882 --> 01:11:33,783
-WeII, how do you feeI?
-Pretty good.

953
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:36,878
I toId her.

954
01:11:37,655 --> 01:11:38,849
WeII, see?

955
01:11:39,657 --> 01:11:43,718
So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea,
me kissing your mom, huh?

956
01:11:43,828 --> 01:11:46,854
But we don't have to
go down that road.

957
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:54,861
This is just the first chapter...

958
01:11:55,673 --> 01:11:59,837
...and I want your absoIute
honest opinion. Okay?

959
01:12:00,745 --> 01:12:04,738
And on page two, he's not reaching
for her ''heaving beasts.''

960
01:12:06,651 --> 01:12:07,948
She couId have heaving beasts.

961
01:12:08,853 --> 01:12:11,845
Right, but in this case she doesn't.

962
01:12:12,757 --> 01:12:13,746
What's a ''niffIe''?

963
01:12:13,858 --> 01:12:16,793
You can usuaIIy find them
on the heaving beasts.

964
01:12:18,863 --> 01:12:20,888
Okay, so I'm not a great typist.

965
01:12:21,699 --> 01:12:25,692
Did you get to the part
about his ''huge, throbbing pens''?

966
01:12:25,903 --> 01:12:29,862
You don't wanna be around
when he starts writing with those.

967
01:12:30,808 --> 01:12:32,799
That's it. Give them back.

968
01:12:33,711 --> 01:12:37,841
Wait, I just got to the part
about her ''pubIic hair.''

969
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:41,170
No, no, we're done!

970
01:13:43,311 --> 01:13:45,336
The One With the Dozen Lasagnas

971
01:14:29,357 --> 01:14:32,155
Aunt Silv, stop yelling!

972
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:35,194
lf you'd told me
vegetarian lasagna...

973
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:37,389
...l would've made
vegetarian lasagna.

974
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:42,394
The meat's only every third layer.
Maybe you could scrape.

975
01:14:43,404 --> 01:14:46,339
Ross, did you really read
all these baby boolks?

976
01:14:47,141 --> 01:14:51,134
You could plunlk me down in
any woman's uterus, no compass...

977
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:54,274
...and l could find my way
out lilke that!

978
01:14:55,282 --> 01:14:56,306
This is cool.

979
01:14:57,118 --> 01:15:01,214
lt says in some parts of the world
people eat the placenta.

980
01:15:03,157 --> 01:15:05,216
And we're done with the yogurt.

981
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:08,117
Sorry.

982
01:15:08,329 --> 01:15:12,129
l did this as a favor.
l am not a caterer.

983
01:15:12,233 --> 01:15:15,327
What do you want me to do
with a dozen lasagnas?

984
01:15:16,237 --> 01:15:18,330
Nice tallk, Aunt Silv.

985
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,367
You lkiss Uncle Freddie
with that mouth?

986
01:15:22,376 --> 01:15:27,370
Ross, listen. Do you lknow that right
now your baby is only this big?

987
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:30,140
This is your baby.
''Hi, Daddy.''

988
01:15:30,351 --> 01:15:31,340
Hello.

989
01:15:32,186 --> 01:15:35,155
''How come you don't live with Mommy?''

990
01:15:36,357 --> 01:15:39,349
''How come Mommy lives
with that other lady?''

991
01:15:44,231 --> 01:15:46,222
''What's a lesbian?''

992
01:15:51,238 --> 01:15:53,297
Honey, you can say it. Poconos.

993
01:15:53,407 --> 01:15:58,208
Poconos. lt's lilke ''polke a nose.''

994
01:16:00,214 --> 01:16:03,206
Polke a nose.

995
01:16:11,325 --> 01:16:14,158
-So did l hear Poconos?
-Yes.

996
01:16:14,261 --> 01:16:17,321
My sister's giving us her place
for the weelkend.

997
01:16:18,132 --> 01:16:19,326
First weelkend together.

998
01:16:19,366 --> 01:16:22,164
-lt's a big step.
-l lknow.

999
01:16:23,170 --> 01:16:27,266
-lt's just a weelkend. Big deal.
-Wasn't this supposed to be a fling?

1000
01:16:27,441 --> 01:16:29,238
Shouldn't it be...

1001
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:31,276
...flung by now?

1002
01:16:32,246 --> 01:16:34,237
We are way past a ''fling.''

1003
01:16:34,348 --> 01:16:38,341
l'm feeling things l've read about
in Danielle Steel boolks.

1004
01:16:38,452 --> 01:16:41,353
When l'm with him,
l'm just totally....

1005
01:16:42,123 --> 01:16:44,284
Nauseous.
l'm physically nauseous.

1006
01:16:45,326 --> 01:16:49,126
What am l supposed to do?
Call lmmigration?

1007
01:16:50,131 --> 01:16:51,393
l could call lmmigration.

1008
01:16:57,104 --> 01:16:58,196
What?

1009
01:16:59,240 --> 01:17:02,141
Ugly Nalked Guy is malking
shadow puppets.

1010
01:17:04,111 --> 01:17:05,408
Loolk, it's Abraham Lincoln.

1011
01:17:07,248 --> 01:17:08,340
Oh, right!

1012
01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:11,311
Go. Go!

1013
01:17:17,124 --> 01:17:20,252
l love babies with
their little baby shoes...

1014
01:17:20,361 --> 01:17:24,354
...and their little baby toes
and their little hands....

1015
01:17:25,132 --> 01:17:28,260
Olkay, you're gonna have to stop that.
Forever.

1016
01:17:38,345 --> 01:17:40,142
Need a new table.

1017
01:17:40,381 --> 01:17:42,110
You thinlk?

1018
01:17:49,223 --> 01:17:51,214
-Come on in.
-Hello.

1019
01:17:51,325 --> 01:17:53,190
l brought the boolks...

1020
01:17:53,327 --> 01:17:57,127
...and Monica sends her love
along with this lasagna.

1021
01:17:57,198 --> 01:18:01,191
Great! ls it vegetarian?
Because Susan doesn't eat meat.

1022
01:18:03,237 --> 01:18:05,296
l'm pretty sure that it is.

1023
01:18:10,211 --> 01:18:14,113
Nineteen weelks, the breasts
are starting to swell.

1024
01:18:15,216 --> 01:18:17,241
According to the literature.

1025
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:21,220
-l got the results of the amnio.
-Tell me. ls everything...?

1026
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:25,315
-Totally and completely healthy.
-That is great!

1027
01:18:31,131 --> 01:18:33,326
When did you and Susan
meet Huey Lewis?

1028
01:18:34,134 --> 01:18:36,125
That's our friend Tanya.

1029
01:18:45,279 --> 01:18:48,077
Of course, it's your friend Tanya.

1030
01:18:50,184 --> 01:18:54,120
-Don't you wanna lknow about the sex?
-The sex?

1031
01:18:55,289 --> 01:19:00,090
l'm having enough trouble with
the image of you and Susan together.

1032
01:19:00,127 --> 01:19:02,186
But when you throw in Tanya....

1033
01:19:05,132 --> 01:19:07,225
The sex of the baby, Ross.

1034
01:19:09,303 --> 01:19:11,294
You lknow the sex of the baby?

1035
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:14,300
-Want to lknow?
-No.

1036
01:19:15,109 --> 01:19:17,134
l don't want to. Absolutely not.

1037
01:19:17,211 --> 01:19:20,203
You shouldn't lknow until
you loolk down there...

1038
01:19:20,314 --> 01:19:22,248
...and see, ''Oh, there it is.''

1039
01:19:23,150 --> 01:19:24,310
Or isn't.

1040
01:19:27,254 --> 01:19:29,347
-Hello, Ross.
-Susan.

1041
01:19:30,157 --> 01:19:31,124
So?

1042
01:19:31,358 --> 01:19:33,121
So did you hear?

1043
01:19:33,227 --> 01:19:35,218
Yes, we did.
Everything's A-Olkay.

1044
01:19:35,329 --> 01:19:38,127
Oh, that's so cool!

1045
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:40,325
lt really is.

1046
01:19:41,168 --> 01:19:42,100
Do we lknow?

1047
01:19:42,269 --> 01:19:45,204
We certainly do.
lt's going to be a--

1048
01:19:45,272 --> 01:19:46,261
Hello?

1049
01:19:46,373 --> 01:19:50,207
A guy who doesn't wanna lknow
is standing here.

1050
01:19:51,312 --> 01:19:54,304
Well, is it what
we thought it would be?

1051
01:20:01,288 --> 01:20:03,119
What--?

1052
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:05,224
What did we thinlk it'd be?

1053
01:20:06,193 --> 01:20:08,320
l don't wanna lknow.
Don't wanna lknow.

1054
01:20:09,129 --> 01:20:10,323
l should probably just go.

1055
01:20:11,198 --> 01:20:14,326
-Well, thanlks for the boolks.
-No problem. Olkay.

1056
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:19,129
Susan.

1057
01:20:24,311 --> 01:20:29,112
Who should we call first?
Your follks or Deb and Rhona?

1058
01:20:32,419 --> 01:20:34,148
Hello?

1059
01:20:36,223 --> 01:20:38,248
<i>Never mind.</i>
<i>I don't wanna know.</i>

1060
01:20:39,326 --> 01:20:43,092
Because it was my table,
l have to buy a new one?

1061
01:20:43,163 --> 01:20:47,099
-That's the rule.
-What rule? There's no rule.

1062
01:20:47,167 --> 01:20:50,295
-You owe me a table.
-How did you get there?

1063
01:20:51,071 --> 01:20:56,065
lt was fine until your brealkfast
adventure with Angela Delvecio.

1064
01:20:56,210 --> 01:20:58,075
You lknew about that?

1065
01:20:58,178 --> 01:21:02,205
The impressions in the butter
left little to the imagination.

1066
01:21:03,183 --> 01:21:05,117
How about if we split it?

1067
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:09,112
-What do you mean, buy it together?
-Yeah.

1068
01:21:09,289 --> 01:21:13,316
-Do you thinlk we're ready for that?
-Why not?

1069
01:21:14,094 --> 01:21:18,087
lt's a big commitment.
What if one of us wants to move out?

1070
01:21:18,132 --> 01:21:20,123
-You're moving out?
-l'm not.

1071
01:21:20,234 --> 01:21:22,327
-You'd tell me if you were, right?
-Yes.

1072
01:21:23,103 --> 01:21:27,233
-lt's just, with my last roommate--
-l lknow all about Kip.

1073
01:21:27,307 --> 01:21:32,301
We bought a hibachi, then he ran off
and got married. Things got ugly.

1074
01:21:33,113 --> 01:21:37,311
Let me aslk you something.
Was Kip a better roommate than me?

1075
01:21:38,118 --> 01:21:39,346
Oh, don't do that.

1076
01:21:45,292 --> 01:21:48,056
There's changes in your schedule.

1077
01:21:48,095 --> 01:21:51,155
Your 4:00 herbal massage is at 4:0.

1078
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:54,190
And Miss Summerfield
canceled her 5:0 shiatsu.

1079
01:21:54,301 --> 01:21:55,290
Thanlks.

1080
01:21:56,170 --> 01:21:58,070
Oh, here comes your :00.

1081
01:21:58,205 --> 01:22:02,107
l don't mean to sound unprofessional,
but-- Yum!

1082
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:09,172
Paolo! Hi! What are you doing here?

1083
01:22:11,185 --> 01:22:14,279
Rachella tell me you...

1084
01:22:15,222 --> 01:22:16,189
...massage?

1085
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:19,115
Well, Rachella's right.

1086
01:22:24,097 --> 01:22:25,121
Oh, olkay.

1087
01:22:25,232 --> 01:22:28,292
l don't lknow what you just said,
so let's start.

1088
01:22:30,204 --> 01:22:31,193
l am...

1089
01:22:32,206 --> 01:22:34,197
...being nalked?

1090
01:22:34,341 --> 01:22:38,209
That's your decision.
Some people prefer to talke off--

1091
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:41,305
Being nalked!

1092
01:22:43,150 --> 01:22:47,143
l can't believe you don't
wanna lknow. l couldn't not lknow.

1093
01:22:47,221 --> 01:22:50,156
lf the doctor lknows,
Carol and Susan lknow--

1094
01:22:50,324 --> 01:22:52,121
And Monica lknows.

1095
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:55,125
How? l don't even lknow.

1096
01:22:55,229 --> 01:22:58,323
Carol called to thanlk me
for the lasagna. She told me.

1097
01:22:59,132 --> 01:23:00,360
So what's it gonna be?

1098
01:23:04,137 --> 01:23:08,267
-Oh, great! Now he lknows.
-l'm just excited about being an aunt.

1099
01:23:08,342 --> 01:23:11,175
Or an uncle.

1100
01:23:15,282 --> 01:23:17,341
-Hey, Phoebe.
-Hey, Pheebs.

1101
01:23:17,384 --> 01:23:18,373
Fine!

1102
01:23:22,155 --> 01:23:25,352
-What's the matter?
-Nothing. l'm just out of sorts.

1103
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:29,361
Well, you can use some of my sorts.
l rarely use them.

1104
01:23:30,163 --> 01:23:32,290
Can we get some cappuccino
over here?

1105
01:23:34,201 --> 01:23:35,361
Oh, right! That's me!

1106
01:23:37,271 --> 01:23:40,263
That table place closes at 7. Come on.

1107
01:23:40,374 --> 01:23:41,398
Fine.

1108
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:44,334
What is it?

1109
01:23:46,146 --> 01:23:50,105
-All right. You lknow Paolo?
-l'm familiar with his worlk.

1110
01:23:51,218 --> 01:23:53,118
He made a move on me.

1111
01:23:53,220 --> 01:23:56,348
-The store will be open tomorrow.
-More coffee, please.

1112
01:23:58,325 --> 01:24:00,122
Well, what happened?

1113
01:24:00,227 --> 01:24:04,220
He came in for a massage,
and everything was fine until....

1114
01:24:08,335 --> 01:24:10,269
-Oh, my God.
-Are you sure?

1115
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:14,163
Oh, yeah. l'm sure.

1116
01:24:18,145 --> 01:24:22,138
And all of a sudden, his hands
weren't the problem anymore.

1117
01:24:26,253 --> 01:24:27,242
Was it...?

1118
01:24:27,354 --> 01:24:30,346
Boy Scouts could've camped
under there.

1119
01:24:34,294 --> 01:24:35,283
Wow.

1120
01:24:35,395 --> 01:24:39,263
-What did you do?
-l dealt with it lilke a professional.

1121
01:24:45,339 --> 01:24:47,204
''Ooh,'' what?

1122
01:24:47,307 --> 01:24:48,296
--ma Thurman.

1123
01:24:48,408 --> 01:24:51,104
-The actress!
-Uma Thurman!

1124
01:24:52,212 --> 01:24:53,201
Thanlks, Rach.

1125
01:24:56,216 --> 01:24:58,309
-What'll you do?
-You have to tell her.

1126
01:24:58,352 --> 01:25:03,255
lt's your moral obligation as a friend,
as a woman. lt's a feminist issue.

1127
01:25:03,323 --> 01:25:04,312
Guys?

1128
01:25:05,125 --> 01:25:08,219
-You have to.
-Feminist issue? That's where l went.

1129
01:25:10,263 --> 01:25:13,232
-She is gonna hate me!
-Yeah, well....

1130
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:23,138
Will you piclk one?
Just piclk one.

1131
01:25:23,176 --> 01:25:27,169
-Here, how about that one?
-That's patio furniture.

1132
01:25:27,347 --> 01:25:32,182
So what? Lilke people will come in
and thinlk, ''Oh, l'm outside again.''

1133
01:25:32,252 --> 01:25:33,241
Fine.

1134
01:25:34,154 --> 01:25:35,280
What about the birds?

1135
01:25:36,456 --> 01:25:41,359
l don't lknow. They don't say,
''Hello, sit here. Eat something.''

1136
01:25:42,329 --> 01:25:45,321
-You piclk one.
-Olkay. How about the ladybugs?

1137
01:25:46,133 --> 01:25:50,194
Forget about the birds, but big red
insects suggest fine dining.

1138
01:25:50,303 --> 01:25:54,399
-Fine! Want the birds? Get the birds!
-Not lilke that, l won't.

1139
01:25:58,111 --> 01:26:00,204
Kip would have lilked the birds.

1140
01:26:11,158 --> 01:26:13,149
-Hi, Pheebs.
-What's going on?

1141
01:26:13,226 --> 01:26:17,128
-Are you moving out?
-l'm getting ready for the weelkend.

1142
01:26:18,331 --> 01:26:21,232
Are your weelkends longer
than two days?

1143
01:26:22,169 --> 01:26:24,137
These aren't all my suitcases.

1144
01:26:24,237 --> 01:26:25,329
This one's Paolo's.

1145
01:26:29,176 --> 01:26:33,135
-Rachel, can we tallk for a sec?
-Well, sure.

1146
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:35,341
Just for a sec, Paolo's on his way.

1147
01:26:48,095 --> 01:26:50,290
We haven't lknown each other that long.

1148
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:53,231
There are three things
you should lknow:

1149
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:58,134
One, my friends are the most
important thing in my life.

1150
01:26:58,238 --> 01:27:00,206
Two, l never lie.

1151
01:27:01,141 --> 01:27:05,202
And three, l malke the best
oatmeal raisin coolkies in the world.

1152
01:27:07,314 --> 01:27:10,249
Olkay. Thanlks, Pheebs.

1153
01:27:15,322 --> 01:27:18,155
-Oh, my God!
-l lknow.

1154
01:27:18,258 --> 01:27:20,317
Why have l never tasted these?

1155
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:25,320
l don't malke them a lot, because
it's not fair to the other coolkies.

1156
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:34,363
These are the best
oatmeal raisin coolkies.

1157
01:27:35,175 --> 01:27:38,338
-Which proves that l never lie.
-l guess you don't.

1158
01:27:39,246 --> 01:27:41,339
Paolo made a pass at me.

1159
01:27:44,084 --> 01:27:45,176
What do you thinlk?

1160
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:48,187
lt's the most beautiful table
l've seen.

1161
01:27:48,288 --> 01:27:49,277
l lknow.

1162
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:52,285
Will you balance plates
on these heads?

1163
01:27:53,093 --> 01:27:55,288
Who cares? We'll eat at the sinlk.
Come on!

1164
01:27:58,098 --> 01:27:59,190
Heads up, Ross.

1165
01:27:59,299 --> 01:28:01,392
Score! You suclk!

1166
01:28:05,138 --> 01:28:06,196
Are you olkay?

1167
01:28:09,242 --> 01:28:10,334
l need some millk.

1168
01:28:12,312 --> 01:28:14,303
Olkay. l've got millk.

1169
01:28:19,319 --> 01:28:21,116
Here you go.

1170
01:28:29,329 --> 01:28:31,126
Better?

1171
01:28:32,332 --> 01:28:33,356
No.

1172
01:28:36,236 --> 01:28:41,333
l feel so stupid! l thinlk about
the other day with you guys.

1173
01:28:41,374 --> 01:28:45,174
And l was all, ''Oh, Paolo!
He's so great!

1174
01:28:45,278 --> 01:28:47,178
He malkes me feel so--''

1175
01:28:48,114 --> 01:28:49,172
God!

1176
01:28:50,083 --> 01:28:51,209
l'm so embarrassed!

1177
01:28:51,318 --> 01:28:53,183
l'm so embarrassed.

1178
01:28:53,286 --> 01:28:57,086
-l'm the one he hit on.
-l unleashed him on you.

1179
01:28:57,123 --> 01:28:59,091
lf l had never met him--

1180
01:28:59,192 --> 01:29:01,183
-l'm so sorry.
-No, l'm sorry.

1181
01:29:01,294 --> 01:29:03,319
-l'm sorry.
-l'm sorry. Wait.

1182
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:06,291
-What are we sorry about?
-l don't lknow.

1183
01:29:06,399 --> 01:29:08,333
Right. He's the pig.

1184
01:29:09,135 --> 01:29:11,330
-Such a pig!
-Oh, God, he's such a pig!

1185
01:29:12,105 --> 01:29:15,233
He's lilke a big disgusting pig....

1186
01:29:15,342 --> 01:29:18,106
-Pig man!
-Yes, good!

1187
01:29:22,215 --> 01:29:25,207
But he was my pig man!

1188
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:28,310
How did l not see this?

1189
01:29:30,223 --> 01:29:31,247
Oh, l lknow!

1190
01:29:34,327 --> 01:29:35,351
Because...

1191
01:29:36,329 --> 01:29:38,126
...he's gorgeous.

1192
01:29:38,231 --> 01:29:39,357
And he's charming.

1193
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:42,293
-And when he loolks--
-Olkay, Pheebs.

1194
01:29:43,069 --> 01:29:44,195
The end.

1195
01:29:47,073 --> 01:29:48,062
God.

1196
01:29:50,076 --> 01:29:52,067
Should l not have told you?

1197
01:29:52,312 --> 01:29:56,112
Trust me, it's much better
that l lknow.

1198
01:29:59,219 --> 01:30:03,178
But l just lilked it better before.
lt was better.

1199
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:24,099
She toolk it pretty well.
Paolo's over there now, so....

1200
01:30:24,244 --> 01:30:28,305
We should go and see if she's olkay.
Just one second.

1201
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:32,243
-Score!
-Game! Nice!

1202
01:30:34,354 --> 01:30:36,117
Come on, Pheebs.

1203
01:30:37,324 --> 01:30:40,316
Well, it loolks lilke we
lkiclked your butts.

1204
01:30:40,360 --> 01:30:45,059
She did. You could be on the Olympic
''Standing There'' team.

1205
01:30:45,098 --> 01:30:46,190
Come on. Two on one.

1206
01:30:46,299 --> 01:30:49,166
Why are you here?
She just brolke up with him.

1207
01:30:49,269 --> 01:30:51,362
lt's time for you to swoop in.

1208
01:30:52,272 --> 01:30:55,173
-What, now?
-Yes. Now is when you swoop.

1209
01:30:55,208 --> 01:30:59,167
When Paolo wallks out,
you gotta be the first guy she sees.

1210
01:30:59,279 --> 01:31:04,182
She's gotta lknow you're everything
he's not. You're the anti-Paolo.

1211
01:31:06,119 --> 01:31:08,087
My Catholic friend is right.

1212
01:31:08,188 --> 01:31:10,315
She's distraught.
You're there for her.

1213
01:31:11,091 --> 01:31:16,324
You piclk up the pieces and then
you usher in ''The Age of Ross.''

1214
01:31:23,303 --> 01:31:26,204
-See this? See?
-Hold it! <i>Ascolta</i>!

1215
01:31:29,309 --> 01:31:31,300
-How's it going?
-Don't stare.

1216
01:31:31,344 --> 01:31:36,304
She threw his clothes off the balcony.
Now there's gesturing and arm-waving.

1217
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:40,245
That is, ''How could you?''
or ''Enormous breasts!''

1218
01:31:42,255 --> 01:31:44,155
Here he comes.

1219
01:31:54,267 --> 01:31:56,064
l am...

1220
01:31:56,269 --> 01:31:58,100
...to say goodbye.

1221
01:31:58,271 --> 01:32:00,102
Olkay, bye-bye.

1222
01:32:03,276 --> 01:32:09,078
Paolo, l really hate you for what you
did, but l still have five of these...

1223
01:32:09,115 --> 01:32:12,084
...so heat it at 75
until the cheese bubbles.

1224
01:32:16,322 --> 01:32:21,316
l just wanna tell you, and l thinlk
l'd spealk for everyone when l say....

1225
01:32:28,201 --> 01:32:30,135
Oh, just loolk at her.

1226
01:32:30,236 --> 01:32:32,397
Guys, l thinlk only one of us
should go...

1227
01:32:33,139 --> 01:32:35,232
-...so she's not overwhelmed.
-Right.

1228
01:32:35,308 --> 01:32:38,141
And l really thinlk it should be me.

1229
01:32:55,128 --> 01:32:56,220
You all right?

1230
01:32:57,230 --> 01:32:59,164
l've been better.

1231
01:33:00,266 --> 01:33:02,234
l don't believe this.

1232
01:33:03,169 --> 01:33:06,161
l wasn't supposed to care
about this guy.

1233
01:33:06,239 --> 01:33:11,142
lt was just supposed to be
this big, fun, ltalian thing.

1234
01:33:11,377 --> 01:33:16,337
Someday l could loolk baclk and say,
''That was a big, fun, ltalian thing.''

1235
01:33:18,184 --> 01:33:21,381
lt wasn't supposed to feel
lilke this when it was over.

1236
01:33:24,257 --> 01:33:25,281
Come here.

1237
01:33:32,365 --> 01:33:34,196
Listen...

1238
01:33:34,267 --> 01:33:37,259
...you deserve
so much better than him.

1239
01:33:37,370 --> 01:33:39,361
l mean, you...

1240
01:33:40,173 --> 01:33:44,109
...should be with a guy who lknows
what he has when he has you.

1241
01:33:47,347 --> 01:33:48,336
What?

1242
01:33:49,349 --> 01:33:52,250
l'm so siclk of guys!

1243
01:33:53,219 --> 01:33:57,349
l don't want to loolk at
or thinlk about another guy.

1244
01:33:58,158 --> 01:34:01,150
l don't even want
to be near another guy.

1245
01:34:08,168 --> 01:34:10,363
Ross, you're so great.

1246
01:34:22,248 --> 01:34:24,341
-Are you all right?
-Are you olkay?

1247
01:34:25,151 --> 01:34:28,348
-Medium. Any coolkies left?
-Yeah.

1248
01:34:31,391 --> 01:34:33,188
See, Rach...

1249
01:34:33,259 --> 01:34:37,355
...l don't thinlk swearing off guys
altogether is the answer.

1250
01:34:38,164 --> 01:34:42,191
What you need is to develop a more
sophisticated screening process.

1251
01:34:44,204 --> 01:34:46,399
l just need to be by myself
for a while.

1252
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:50,303
-l just gotta figure out what l want.
-No, no.

1253
01:34:51,311 --> 01:34:55,247
See, because not all guys out there
are gonna be a Paolo.

1254
01:34:55,315 --> 01:34:57,306
No, l lknow. l lknow.

1255
01:34:57,350 --> 01:35:02,117
And l'm sure your little boy's
not gonna grow up to be one.

1256
01:35:03,122 --> 01:35:05,113
-What?
-What?

1257
01:35:07,327 --> 01:35:09,124
l'm having a boy?

1258
01:35:10,129 --> 01:35:11,255
No.

1259
01:35:12,232 --> 01:35:15,326
No. ln fact, you're not having a boy.

1260
01:35:16,236 --> 01:35:18,136
l'm having a boy.

1261
01:35:19,339 --> 01:35:23,241
-Huh? Am l having a boy?
-You're having a boy!

1262
01:35:23,376 --> 01:35:25,139
l'm having a boy!

1263
01:35:25,245 --> 01:35:27,236
-l'm having a boy!
-What is it?

1264
01:35:27,347 --> 01:35:30,180
l'm having a boy!
l'm having a boy!

1265
01:35:34,153 --> 01:35:35,347
We already lknew that!

1266
01:35:39,158 --> 01:35:40,352
l'm having a son.

1267
01:35:48,334 --> 01:35:51,235
Yes! And that would be a shutdown!

1268
01:35:51,304 --> 01:35:52,328
Shutout!

1269
01:35:56,209 --> 01:35:59,110
Where you going? One more game!

1270
01:35:59,145 --> 01:36:02,205
-lt's 2:0 in the morning.
-Yeah, get out!

1271
01:36:02,415 --> 01:36:05,350
You guys always hang out
in my apartment.

1272
01:36:06,152 --> 01:36:08,245
l'll only use my left hand.

1273
01:36:08,354 --> 01:36:10,322
Come on, wussies!

1274
01:36:14,327 --> 01:36:16,352
All right! Olkay! l gotta go!

1275
01:36:17,230 --> 01:36:18,254
l'm going.

1276
01:36:19,132 --> 01:36:20,224
And l'm gone.

1277
01:36:23,169 --> 01:36:25,137
-One more game?
-Oh, yeah.
