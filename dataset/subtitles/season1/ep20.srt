1
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:05,431
I can't beIieve
you'd actuaIIy say that.

2
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:09,333
I'd much rather be Mr. Peanut
than Mr. SaIty.

3
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:12,343
No way.
Mr. SaIty is a saiIor.

4
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:15,348
He's gotta be
the toughest snack there is.

5
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:20,351
I don't know. You don't
wanna mess with Cornnuts.

6
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,352
They're crazy.

7
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:27,258
Oh, my God. You gotta come see this.

8
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:30,387
There's some creep out there
with a teIescope.

9
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,460
I can't beIieve it.
He's Iooking right at us.

10
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:36,462
Oh, that is so sick.

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,464
I feeI vioIated.

12
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,466
And not in a good way.

13
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,374
How can peopIe do that?

14
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:48,576
You guys, Iook.
UgIy Naked Guy got gravity boots.

15
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,476
The One With the EviI Orthodontist

16
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,391
Years from now,
schooI chiIdren wiII study it...

17
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,461
...as one of the greatest
first dates ever.

18
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,374
-Yeah.
-I'II say, yeah.

19
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:50,299
It was unbeIievabIe.

20
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,402
We couId be ourseIves.
We didn't have to pIay games.

21
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,473
-Have you caIIed her?
-She'd know I Iike her. That's crazy.

22
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,308
Guys. It's gross.

23
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:02,252
It's the next day.
How needy do I wanna seem?

24
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:05,314
-I'm right. Right?
-Yeah, Iet her dangIe.

25
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,526
I can't beIieve my parents are
pushing me to find one of you peopIe.

26
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,358
Come on. Just do it.

27
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:18,234
CaII her.
Stop being so testosterone-y.

28
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,432
Which, by the way,
is the reaI San Francisco treat.

29
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,471
-Her machine.
-Answering machine?

30
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:33,446
No, interestingIy,
her Ieaf bIower picked up.

31
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,281
So, why didn't you say anything?

32
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:41,383
No. Last time I Ieft
a spontaneous message...

33
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:45,363
...I ended up using the phrase,
''Yes, indeed-io.''

34
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:49,459
Look, it's RacheI and Barry.
Don't everybody Iook.

35
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,496
What's going on?

36
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:55,264
-They're just taIking.
-Does he Iook upset?

37
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,469
Does he Iook Iike he was toId
to shove anything?

38
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,314
No. ActuaIIy, he's smiIing.

39
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,406
Oh, my God. Don't do that.

40
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:05,513
What? What? What?

41
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,449
That man across the street
just kicked that pigeon.

42
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:16,525
And basicaIIy, that's how
a biII becomes a Iaw.

43
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:21,262
See? Hey, Rach.

44
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,359
How'd it go?

45
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,433
You know, it was actuaIIy
reaIIy great.

46
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,435
Lunch at the Russian Tea Room.

47
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,474
I had that chicken, where you poke it
and butter squirts out.

48
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,475
Not a good day for birds.

49
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,443
Then we went to BendeI's.

50
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:41,448
And I toId him not to, but he got me
a bottIe of ChaneI.

51
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:46,347
That's nice. Now was that before
or after you toId him...

52
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:51,261
...to stop caIIing, stop sending
fIowers and to Ieave you aIone?

53
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:55,300
Right. WeII, we never actuaIIy
got to that.

54
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,370
It was just so nice to see him again.

55
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:02,237
It was comfortabIe
and it was famiIiar.

56
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,205
It was just nice.

57
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,210
That's nice twice.

58
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:11,340
Isn't this the same Barry
who you Ieft at the aItar?

59
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,311
Where have you been?

60
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,312
It was different
with him today.

61
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,258
He wasn't, Iike, Orthodontist Guy.

62
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,229
I mean, we had fun.
Is there anything wrong with that?

63
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:30,268
-Why?
-I have my reasons.

64
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,271
He's engaged to another woman...

65
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,344
...who happens to be
your ex-best friend?

66
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,242
AII right.
I know it's stupid.

67
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:44,373
I'II see him this afternoon
and put an end to it.

68
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:55,291
I'm not crazy, right?
I mean, it was never Iike that.

69
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,395
No, it wasn't.

70
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,429
It was so nice
having this IittIe sink here.

71
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:14,236
Then with authority, hang up.

72
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,442
WiII you just Ieave her the message?

73
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,219
Okay. AII right, fine.

74
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,315
''Oh, DanieIIe,
I wasn't expecting the machine.

75
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,455
Give me a caII
when you get a chance.

76
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:34,457
Bye-bye.''

77
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,459
Oh, God.

78
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:42,332
That's what you've been working on
for two hours?

79
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,470
Hey, I've been honing.

80
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:50,246
-What was with the dishes?
-She might think I'm in a restaurant.

81
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:54,343
I might have a Iife.
Like I haven't been sitting here...

82
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:56,479
...honing for the Iast two hours?

83
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:01,283
-The teIescope guy's doing it again.
-Oh, my God.

84
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:06,426
Go away.
Stop Iooking in here.

85
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,326
Great.
Now he's waving back.

86
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,398
We gotta do something.

87
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:17,499
I caught him Iooking into our pIace.
I feeI Iike I can't do stuff.

88
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:20,412
What kind of stuff?

89
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:26,214
WiII you grow up?
I'm not taIking about sexy stuff...

90
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,311
...but, Iike,
when I'm cooking naked.

91
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,219
You cook naked?

92
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:35,419
Yeah, toast, oatmeaI.
Nothing that spatters.

93
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,360
What are you Iooking at me for?
I didn't know that.

94
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,363
What's the matter?

95
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,433
I just--
Oh, Barry, this was not good.

96
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,540
No, it was.
It was very, very good.

97
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,437
-What about Mindy?
-Way better than Mindy.

98
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,378
I mean, what about you and Mindy?

99
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,289
If you want, I'II
break it off with her.

100
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,285
No, don't do that.
Not for me.

101
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:12,228
<i>Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush</i>
<i>is here for his adjustment.</i>

102
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,232
Thanks, Bernice.

103
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,334
Let's go away this weekend.

104
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:20,430
-This is aII way too--
-No, we can go to Aruba.

105
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:25,207
When I went there on what
wouId've been our honeymoon...

106
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:29,247
...it was reaIIy nice.
You wouId've Iiked it.

107
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:31,442
I had a bra.

108
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,418
Hey, Dr. Farber.

109
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:48,366
AII right, Miss Greene,
everything Iooks fine.

110
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,430
We're starting to see
some reaI progress.

111
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,366
-What?
-I'm 1 2, I'm not stupid.

112
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,319
Can I use your phone?

113
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,419
For future reference,
that thing in your hand...

114
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,218
...can aIso be used as a phone.

115
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,333
Yes, it's working.

116
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:27,238
-Why isn't she caIIing?
-Maybe she never got your message.

117
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,434
CaII her machine,
and if she has a Iot of beeps...

118
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,235
...that means she didn't get
her messages yet.

119
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:38,343
-Doesn't that make me seem--?
-Desperate? Needy? Pathetic?

120
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:41,318
You obviousIy saw my personaI ad.

121
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,255
How many beeps?

122
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:46,450
She answered.

123
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:52,227
This is where you'd use
that ''heIIo'' word.

124
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:55,331
I won't taIk to her.
She got my message...

125
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:59,461
...and is choosing not to caII me.
Now I'm needy and snubbed.

126
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,365
God, I miss just being needy.

127
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,471
So how'd he take it?

128
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,373
Pretty weII, actuaIIy.

129
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,377
How come you have
dentaI fIoss in your hair?

130
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,281
Oh, do I?

131
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:25,425
-We ended up having sex in his chair.
-You had sex in his chair?

132
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,305
I said that a IittIe
too IoudIy, didn't I?

133
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,238
You had what?

134
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,334
Sex in his chair.

135
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:45,206
What...? What were you thinking?

136
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,311
I don't know.
We stiII care about each other.

137
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,346
There's a history there.
It's Iike you and CaroI.

138
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,318
It's nothing Iike me and CaroI.

139
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,422
If she said to you,
''Ross, I want you on this couch...

140
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:04,361
...right here, right now,''
what wouId you say?

141
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,430
If it heIps, I couId sIide over.

142
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:14,440
It's a totaIIy different situation.
It's appIes and oranges.

143
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,444
It's orthodontists and Iesbians--
I gotta go.

144
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,378
-Where are you going?
-I just have to go.

145
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:25,253
I have things to do with my Iife.

146
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,384
I have a jam-packed scheduIe.

147
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,362
And I am Iate for keeping up
with it, okay?

148
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,403
Mindy.

149
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,474
How are you?

150
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:54,309
Yes, I heard. CongratuIations.
That is so great.

151
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,388
ReaIIy, oh, God--

152
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:04,228
I'm working tomorrow, but if you
want, you can come by if you'd Iike.

153
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:07,262
Great.

154
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,459
Great.

155
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,269
So I'II see you tomorrow.

156
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,534
Okay. Bye.

157
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,437
Oh, God. Oh, God.

158
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,541
So how's Mindy?

159
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:30,253
She wants to see me tomorrow. She
sounded weird. I gotta caII Barry.

160
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,260
It's me. I just--
Mindy.

161
00:11:37,396 --> 00:11:41,264
Mindy. No, I figured
that's where you'd be.

162
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,444
HeII is fiIIed
with peopIe Iike you.

163
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,418
He's back.
The peeper's back.

164
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:08,425
-Get down.
-Get down?

165
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:10,319
And boogie.

166
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:15,459
I gotta go and get
my eyes scratched out by Mindy.

167
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,429
She may not even know.

168
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:23,368
I haven't heard from her in seven
months, what eIse is it about?

169
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,433
She was my best friend.

170
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:29,442
We went to camp together,
she taught me how to kiss....

171
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,443
Now, you know,
I'm, Iike, the other woman.

172
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:38,457
-I feeI so--
-Naughty.

173
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,360
-See you Iater.
-I'II waIk with you.

174
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:49,265
When she taught you to kiss, were you
wearing any kind of IittIe uniform--?

175
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,464
That's fine, yeah.

176
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:57,299
I'm going to the bathroom.
WiII you watch my phone?

177
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:00,311
-Take it with you.
-We haven't had a second date...

178
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:04,214
-...she needs to hear me pee?
-Why don't you caII her?

179
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:07,308
I can't. I Ieft a message.
I have some pride.

180
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,410
-Do you?
-No.

181
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,354
DanieIIe, hi.

182
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,420
It's ChandIer.

183
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,329
I'm fine.

184
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:23,462
Listen....

185
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:27,433
I don't know if you tried
to caII me because...

186
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,470
...I accidentaIIy shut off my phone.

187
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,539
That's fine. That's great. Okay.

188
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:41,251
She's on the other Iine.
She's gonna caII me back.

189
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:45,289
She's on the other Iine,
she's gonna caII me back.

190
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:49,350
-Don't you have to pee?
-That's why I'm dancing.

191
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,358
-Mindy.
-Hey, you.

192
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,468
Hey, you.

193
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,398
So what's up?

194
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,235
We shouId reaIIy be sitting for this.

195
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,311
Sure we shouId.

196
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:22,419
I'm gonna ask once,
and I want a straight answer.

197
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:27,421
Not Iike when I asked if those red
pants made my ass Iook big.

198
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,268
I know things have been weird...

199
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:33,328
...but you're my oIdest friend,
except for Laurie...

200
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,272
...who's bitter because
she Iost weight...

201
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,344
...and it turns out,
she doesn't have a pretty face.

202
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,370
-Okay, I'm just gonna say it.
-Okay.

203
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,351
WiII you be my maid of honor?

204
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,357
-Of course.
-That's so great.

205
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,350
It is. It is. It is.

206
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:59,396
-That's aII you wanted to ask?
-That's aII.

207
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,203
-What?
-That's not aII.

208
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,397
-Oh, sure it is.
-Oh, no, it isn't.

209
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,438
I think Barry's seeing someone
in the city.

210
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:17,305
What wouId make you think that?

211
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,351
Since the engagement,
he's acted weird.

212
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:25,412
And then Iast night, he came home
smeIIing Iike ChaneI.

213
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,416
ReaIIy?

214
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,226
If it'II make you feeI any better...

215
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,425
...when Barry and I got engaged,
he was weird too.

216
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,328
Oh, God.
That's what I was afraid of.

217
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,237
What's what you were afraid of?

218
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:47,344
When Barry was engaged to you,
he and I...

219
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:51,338
...kind of had
a IittIe thing on the side.

220
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,342
-What?
-I know, I know.

221
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:59,447
When he proposed, peopIe said, ''He'II
do to you what he did to RacheI.''

222
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:02,220
And now I feeI so stupid.

223
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,195
You are so stupid.

224
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:12,336
We are both so stupid.

225
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:14,338
What do you mean?

226
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,205
SmeII famiIiar?

227
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,405
Oh, I'm so sorry.

228
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,408
Oh, no, me.
I am so sorry.

229
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:27,515
No, I am sorry.
I'm sorry.

230
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:43,360
Oh, my.

231
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,335
Four Ietters, ''circIe or hoop.''

232
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,341
-Ring, damn it, ring.
-Thanks.

233
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:58,439
-You know our phone's not working?
-What?

234
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,476
I caIIed and there was no answer.

235
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,381
I turned it off.

236
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,180
Mother of God, I turned it off.

237
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:09,326
Just Iike you toId her you did.

238
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,390
Just pointing out the irony.

239
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:16,197
I went across the street
to the doorman.

240
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:20,227
I got the peeper's name.
Can I use the phone?

241
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,207
Can I use your phone?

242
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:29,313
The number for a Sidney Marks, pIease.

243
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,440
''Heating device.''

244
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:33,409
Radiator.

245
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,208
Five Ietters.

246
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,219
''Rdtor.''

247
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,360
Yeah, is Sidney there?

248
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,365
Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman.

249
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,298
So she's a woman, so what?

250
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,463
Yeah, so what?

251
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:56,264
I Iive across the street, and I know
about your teIescope.

252
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,307
And I don't appreciate it.

253
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:01,242
Yeah, I can see you right now.
HeIIo?

254
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:06,373
If I wanna waIk around in my
underwear, I shouIdn't have to feeI--

255
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,316
Thank you.

256
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:14,223
That's not reaIIy the point.
The point is, that--

257
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:17,319
MostIy free-weights,
but occasionaIIy--

258
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:22,198
Yeah, my neighbor.
Yeah, the brunette.

259
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:27,236
She said you Iooked pretty that day
in the green dress.

260
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,500
The green dress? ReaIIy?

261
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:33,302
She said you Iooked Iike
Ingrid Bergman.

262
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,442
Did she mention me?

263
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:46,357
She wants to know why you tie
the toweI around your head.

264
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:50,252
It's a Ieave-in conditioner, okay?

265
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,425
It's a Ieave-in conditioner.

266
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,204
-You got a second?
-Sure, sure.

267
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,261
Come on...

268
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:04,369
-...in.
-HeIIo, sweetheart.

269
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,278
What you guys doing here?

270
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,213
We are here to break up with you.

271
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,374
Both of you?

272
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:18,281
We think you're a horribIe person,
and bad things shouId happen to you.

273
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,415
I'm sorry.
God, I am so sorry.

274
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:24,320
I was weak.
I couIdn't heIp myseIf.

275
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:28,490
Whatever I did, I onIy did
because I Iove you so much.

276
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:33,396
Which one of us
are you taIking to there?

277
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:36,396
Mindy.

278
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:39,336
Of course, Mindy.
It was aIways Mindy.

279
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:42,242
When we were having sex
in that chair?

280
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:46,214
I swear, whatever I was doing,
I was thinking of you.

281
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:51,415
PIease. That second time, you couIdn't
have picked her out of a Iineup.

282
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,418
You did it twice?

283
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:58,225
The first time didn't reaIIy count.
You know, it was Barry.

284
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:02,365
Honey, sweetheart, Iook.
Just give me another chance.

285
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:05,368
We'II start over.
We'II go back to Aruba.

286
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:10,430
What is it with you and Aruba?
Do you have a deaI with the airIines?

287
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:12,467
What do you say?

288
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:15,473
<i>Dr. Farber, we've got</i>
<i>an emergency here.</i>

289
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,442
<i>Jason Castalano's choking</i>
<i>on his retainer.</i>

290
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,446
Oh, God.
I'II be right there, Bernice.

291
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:24,245
Look, pIease don't go anywhere.

292
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:26,290
I'II be right back.

293
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,484
Okay, and we'II be here,
hating you.

294
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:34,455
See how he was sweating
when he waIked out?

295
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:38,297
If I'm hogging the baII,
you jump right in there...

296
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:41,270
...and take some punches.
This feeIs great.

297
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,570
I'm pretty sure
I'm stiII gonna marry him.

298
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:48,369
What are you taIking about?

299
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,381
Mindy, the guy is the deviI.

300
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:53,474
He is Satan in a smock.

301
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,387
I know he's not perfect.

302
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:05,219
But the truth is at the end of
the day, I stiII reaIIy wanna be...

303
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,356
...Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber...

304
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,325
...D.D.S.

305
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:13,226
Oh, God.

306
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:17,265
I hope you can find a way
to be happy for me.

307
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:20,470
And I hope you'II stiII be
my maid of honor.

308
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,341
And I hope Barry doesn't kiII you
and eat you in Aruba.

309
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,550
You okay?

310
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,552
ReaIIy?

311
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:42,265
Since I ran out on Barry
at the wedding...

312
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:45,461
...I've wondered whether I made
the right choice.

313
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:47,363
And now I know.

314
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,304
I'm so gIad.

315
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:55,573
Big day.

316
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,417
I'II give you this:
Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.

317
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:10,461
He's got the monocIe,
he's got the top hat....

318
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:12,423
Did you know he's gay?

319
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:20,227
I just wanna cIarify this.
Are you outing Mr. Peanut?

320
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,272
DanieIIe, hi.

321
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,369
Everybody, this is DanieIIe.
DanieIIe, everybody.

322
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,371
Why are you here?

323
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,474
I've been caIIing,
but I had your number wrong.

324
00:22:33,285 --> 00:22:36,345
When I got the right one,
there was no answer.

325
00:22:36,455 --> 00:22:41,256
So I thought I'd come down here
and make sure you were okay.

326
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,282
I'm okay.

327
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:45,295
Maybe we couId get together Iater?

328
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:50,265
That sounds good. I'II caII you.
Or you caII me, whatever.

329
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,360
You got it.

330
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,404
-Bye, everybody.
-Bye.

331
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:59,277
-There you go.
-Second date.

332
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,402
I don't know.

333
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,302
You don't know?

334
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:06,248
She seems nice, but her coming
