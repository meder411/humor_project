00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:05,361
Everybody! CentraI Perk
is proud to present...

2
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:09,431
...the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.

3
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,277
Thanks.

4
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:17,280
I wanna start with a song
that's about that moment...

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,446
...when you suddenIy reaIize
what Iife is reaIIy aII about.

6
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:24,352
Okay, here we go.

7
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:29,453
Okay. Thank you very much.

8
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,502
Oh, great. This is just--

9
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,576
The One With The BIackout

10
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,498
This is so cooI, you guys.
The entire city's bIacked out.

11
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:48,274
It's aII of Manhattan.
They have no idea...

12
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,276
...when it's back on.

13
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:54,403
-You guys, this is big.
-Pants and a sweater. Why, Mom?

14
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,306
Who wiII I meet in a bIackout?

15
00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:01,353
Power-company guys?
EIigibIe Iooters?

16
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:05,453
-Can we taIk about this Iater? Okay.
-Can I borrow the phone?

17
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:09,354
I wanna caII my apartment
and check on my grandma.

18
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,226
What's my number?

19
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,433
I never caII me.

20
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:20,329
<i>Oh, my God! It's her.</i>
<i>It's that Victoria's Secret model.</i>

21
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,431
<i>Something Goodacre.</i>

22
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,334
Hi, Mom, it's JiII.

23
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:28,279
<i>She's right. It's Jill.</i>
<i>Jill Goodacre. Oh, my God!</i>

24
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:32,284
<i>I am trapped in an ATM vestibule</i>
<i>with Jill Goodacre.</i>

25
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,288
<i>Is it a vestibule?</i>
<i>Maybe it's an atrium.</i>

26
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:40,358
<i>Yeah, that is the part</i>
<i>to focus on, you idiot.</i>

27
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:45,387
I'm fine. I'm just stuck
at the bank in an ATM vestibuIe.

28
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:49,492
<i>Jill says vestibule,</i>
<i>I'm going with vestibule.</i>

29
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,263
I'm fine. No, I'm not aIone.

30
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,372
I don't know, some guy.

31
00:02:56,476 --> 00:03:00,435
<i>Oh, some guy. I am some guy.</i>

32
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,409
<i>Jill, I saw you with some guy</i>
<i>last night.</i>

33
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,412
<i>Yes, he was some guy.</i>

34
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,326
Hey, everyone.

35
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:28,230
Officiating at tonight's bIackout
is Rabbi Tribbiani.

36
00:03:31,277 --> 00:03:35,441
ChandIer's oId roommate was Jewish.
These are our onIy candIes.

37
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,243
So happy Hanukkah!

38
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:42,446
Look! UgIy Naked Guy
Iit a bunch of candIes.

39
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,254
That had to hurt!

40
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,368
<i>All right, all right!</i>
<i>It's been 1 2 1 /2 minutes...</i>

41
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,371
<i>...and you still haven't said</i>
<i>one word. God!</i>

42
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:03,203
<i>Do something!</i>
<i>Just make contact. Smile!</i>

43
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,305
<i>There you go.</i>

44
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:14,309
<i>You're definitely scaring her.</i>

45
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,227
HeIIo? Oh, hi, Mom.

46
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,326
Mom.

47
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,329
Mom, you're tripping!

48
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:30,327
Dexter's a dog.
The bIackout's scaring him.

49
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,237
You'd pee in Dad's shoes too
if you didn't know.

50
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,267
AII right, caII me back.

51
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,434
-Mothers.
-Yeah.

52
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,481
<i>Attaboy! A word.</i>

53
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,445
<i>That wasn't so hard.</i>
<i>Mothers. Yeah!</i>

54
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,453
<i>Mothers. Yeah! Perfect.</i>

55
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,390
<i>Don't smile.</i>

56
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:55,552
WouId you Iike to caII somebody?

57
00:04:56,462 --> 00:05:00,228
<i>Yeah, about 300 guys I went</i>
<i>to high school with.</i>

58
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,236
Yeah, thanks.

59
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,302
-HeIIo?
-It's me.

60
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:16,405
-It's ChandIer. Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

61
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:21,250
I'm stuck in an ATM vestibuIe...

62
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:25,247
...with JiII Goodacre.

63
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:29,251
-What?
-I'm stuck...

64
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,329
...in an ATM vestibuIe...

65
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,457
...with JiII Goodacre.

66
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,532
I have no idea what you said.

67
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,239
Put Joey on the phone.

68
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:45,435
-What's up, man?
-I'm stuck...

69
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,279
...in an ATM vestibuIe...

70
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:52,451
...with JiII Goodacre!

71
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,442
Oh, my God!

72
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:58,348
He's trapped in an ATM vestibuIe
with JiII Goodacre!

73
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,317
ChandIer, Iisten.

74
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:08,198
Like that thought
never entered my mind.

75
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,194
-Okay.
-Somebody.

76
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,239
-I'II go. I'II go.
-Okay.

77
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:19,243
Senior year of coIIege,
on a pooI tabIe.

78
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:22,437
-PooI tabIe?
-That's my sister.

79
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,413
Okay, my weirdest pIace
wouId have to be...

80
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:32,419
...the women's room of the New York
City PubIic Library.

81
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,456
Oh, my God! What were you
doing in a Iibrary?

82
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,462
-Pheebs, what about you?
-Oh, MiIwaukee.

83
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,366
It's a reaIIy weird pIace.

84
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,469
Ross?

85
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,375
DisneyIand, 1 989.
''It's a smaII worId after aII.''

86
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,417
No way.

87
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,380
The ride broke down...

88
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:08,190
...so CaroI and I went behind
those mechanicaI Dutch chiIdren.

89
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:12,390
We were asked never to return
to the Magic IKingdom.

90
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,403
Let's see, that Ieaves....

91
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,338
-RacheI?
-Come on, I aIready went.

92
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,237
-You did not go.
-I did.

93
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:24,309
TeII us. Come on.

94
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:29,438
AII right, the weirdest pIace
wouId have to be...

95
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:34,243
...the foot of the bed.

96
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:38,254
-Step back!
-We have a winner!

97
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:51,260
This must be what the fridge
Iooks Iike with the door cIosed.

98
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,334
Spooky.

99
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,436
Anybody hungry?
We got a IKIondike...soup.

100
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:03,280
I've never had a reIationship
with that kind of passion.

101
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:07,184
Where you have to have somebody
even in a theme park.

102
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:13,386
It was the onIy thing to do
that didn't have a Iine.

103
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:19,287
Barry wouIdn't even kiss me
on a miniature goIf course.

104
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:20,387
-Come on.
-No.

105
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,300
He said we heId up
the peopIe behind us.

106
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,294
You didn't marry him because...?

107
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:31,435
Do you think there are peopIe
that go through Iife...

108
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,406
...never having that kind of...?

109
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,312
-ProbabIy.
-ReaIIy?

110
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,475
I'II teII you something.
Passion is way overrated.

111
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,413
-Yeah, right.
-It is.

112
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,321
EventuaIIy, it kind of burns out.

113
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:49,417
But hopefuIIy what you're Ieft
with is trust and security and....

114
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,453
In my ex-wife's case,
Iesbianism.

115
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:01,372
For those peopIe who miss out
on that passion thing...

116
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,272
...there's other stuff.

117
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,371
-Okay.
-But I don't think that'II be you.

118
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,182
-You don't?
-See, I see...

119
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:16,312
-...big passion in your future.
-ReaIIy?

120
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,382
-You do?
-I do.

121
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:22,227
Ross, you're so great.

122
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,229
It's never gonna happen.

123
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,238
-What?
-You and RacheI.

124
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:51,313
What--? Me and Ra--?

125
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,416
Why not?

126
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:58,328
You waited too Iong
to make your move...

127
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:01,333
...and now you're
in the ''friend zone.''

128
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,462
-I'm not in the zone.
-No, Ross. You're mayor of the zone.

129
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:13,242
Look, I'm taking my time, aII right?
I'm Iaying the groundwork.

130
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,281
Every day I get
a IittIe bit cIoser to--

131
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,373
Priesthood!

132
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:23,345
I'm teIIing you, she has
no idea what you're thinking.

133
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,483
She just ran her fingers
through my hair.

134
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,456
-Were you missing that interaction?
-No, no, no.

135
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:34,465
This is running fingers
through your hair, okay?

136
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:38,293
Now this is a tousIe.

137
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:44,366
If you don't ask her out soon,
you'II be in the zone forever.

138
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,369
I wiII, I wiII.
I'm waiting for the right moment.

139
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,375
What?

140
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:55,412
-What, now?
-Yeah.

141
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,225
What's messing you up?
The wine? The moonIight?

142
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:05,227
You gotta go up to her and say,
''Look, RacheI, I--''

143
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:08,460
-What?
-We're shushing...

144
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:12,369
...because we're trying
to hear something.

145
00:11:12,471 --> 00:11:16,373
-What? What?
-Don't you hear that?

146
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:22,536
See?

147
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,347
-WouId you Iike gum?
-Is it sugarIess?

148
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,384
-Sorry, it's not.
-Then no, thanks.

149
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:36,450
<i>What was that?</i>

150
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:43,291
<i>Mental note: If Jill Goodacre</i>
<i>offers you gum, you take it.</i>

151
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:47,498
<i>If she offers you mangled</i>
<i>animal carcass, you take it!</i>

152
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:53,274
<i>New York City has no power</i>

153
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,507
<i>And the milk is getting sour</i>

154
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,318
<i>But to me it is not scary</i>

155
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,446
<i>Because I stay away from dairy</i>

156
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,359
-Here goes.
-You'II do it?

157
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,265
-I'II do it.
-Want heIp?

158
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,361
You come out, you're a dead man.

159
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,276
-Good Iuck, man.
-Thanks.

160
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,374
-Okay.
-Okay.

161
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:38,287
Where you going?
You can't go out there.

162
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:42,293
-Why not?
-Because of the reason.

163
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:47,262
-That wouId be?
-I can't teII you.

164
00:12:47,366 --> 00:12:49,357
Joey, what's going on?

165
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:54,303
You gotta promise you'II
never teII Ross that I toId you.

166
00:12:54,373 --> 00:12:57,308
-What?
-He's pIanning your birthday party.

167
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,338
-Oh, my God! I Iove him!
-You better act surprised.

168
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:05,212
-About what?
-My surprise party.

169
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:09,253
-What surprise party?
-Oh, stop it. Joey aIready toId me.

170
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,320
He didn't teII me.

171
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,522
Don't Iook at me. This is Ross' thing.

172
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:18,355
This is typicaI.
I'm aIways the Iast to know.

173
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,421
You are not. We teII you stuff.

174
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:26,268
I was the Iast one to know when
ChandIer got bit by the peacock.

175
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,333
I was the Iast to know
you had a crush on Joey.

176
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,365
What?

177
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,245
Looks Iike I was second to Iast.

178
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:41,442
You had a crush on me?

179
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:47,357
AII right. It wasn't a crush,
it was a dent.

180
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:49,554
Big dent?

181
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:55,359
You were moving your furniture.
I thought you had nice arms.

182
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,396
Nice arms, huh?

183
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,208
Hey, Mon, I'm moving the chair.

184
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,403
Do anything for you?

185
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:13,242
With aII the Iights out
you can actuaIIy see the stars.

186
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,252
It's so nice.

187
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,358
I have a question.

188
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:26,230
ActuaIIy, it's not
so much a question.

189
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,459
It's more
of a generaI wondering....

190
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:30,459
--ment.

191
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,429
-Okay.
-Okay. Here it goes.

192
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:42,245
WeII, for a whiIe now,
I've been wanting to....

193
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:47,445
-Yes, that's right.
-Look at that IittIe kitty!

194
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,378
What?

195
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:56,250
<i>Top of the world</i>
<i>Looking down on creation</i>

196
00:14:56,295 --> 00:15:00,288
<i>And the only explanation I can find</i>

197
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:08,197
<i>Is the love that I found</i>
<i>Ever since you've been around</i>

198
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:25,256
AII right, this is just Bactine.
It won't hurt.

199
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,353
-Ow!
-Sorry, that was wax.

200
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:36,264
Poor IittIe Tooty's scared.
We shouId find his owner.

201
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,428
Why not put poor Tooty in the haII?

202
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:42,439
During a bIackout?
She'II get trampIed.

203
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,271
Yeah?

204
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:49,447
<i>Damage control. Get back to the gum.</i>

205
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,477
Gum wouId be perfection.

206
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,278
<i>Gum would be perfection?</i>

207
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,446
<i>Gum would be perfection.</i>

208
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:02,386
<i>Could've said,</i>
<i>''Gum would be nice. '' But, no.</i>

209
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:06,330
<i>For me, gum is perfection.</i>

210
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:10,292
<i>I loathe myself!</i>

211
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:15,430
Oh, no, they're nuns.
They hate aII Iiving things.

212
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:26,248
Hi. We just found this cat,
and we're Iooking for the owner.

213
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,411
Yeah, it's mine.

214
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:34,453
-He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
-It's my cat. Give me my cat.

215
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:39,329
-Wait a minute. What's his name?
-Bob-- Buttons.

216
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:44,334
-Bob Buttons?
-Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons.

217
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,431
You are a very bad man!

218
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,241
You owe me a cat.

219
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,441
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

220
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,381
Here, kitty, kitty.

221
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,478
Where did you go, IittIe kitty?

222
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:08,257
IKitty, kitty, kitty.
Come here, kitty, kitty.

223
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,496
-Hi.
<i>-Buona sera.</i>

224
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,393
Wow!

225
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,234
Mon, wanna go for a ride
in my racecar?

226
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,279
I'II bring my arms.

227
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,342
We can bring my wheeIbarrow
for your teeth!

228
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,255
Come on, Iucky sixes!

229
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,418
Everybody, this is PaoIo.

230
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:45,422
PaoIo, I want you to meet my friends.
This is Monica...

231
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,432
-Hi.
-...and Joey...

232
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,435
-Hi.
-...and Ross.

233
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,294
Hi.

234
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,178
He doesn't speak much EngIish.

235
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:04,215
MonopoIy!

236
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:07,248
Look at that!

237
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,188
So, where did PaoIo come from?

238
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,419
ItaIy, I think.

239
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:18,390
No, I mean tonight.
SuddenIy, into our Iives.

240
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:24,234
That cat turned out to be PaoIo's cat.
Isn't that funny?

241
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:29,305
That is funny.
And RacheI keeps touching him.

242
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:36,237
I Iooked aII over and couIdn't find
the kitty anywhere.

243
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:38,442
I found him. It was PaoIo's cat.

244
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,352
WeII, there you go.
Last to know again.

245
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:47,222
And I'm guessing, this is PaoIo?

246
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,361
PaoIo, this is Phoebe.

247
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,425
You betcha!

248
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,297
<i>All right. Okay. What next?</i>

249
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:07,178
<i>Blow a bubble. A bubble's good.</i>

250
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:10,181
<i>It's got a boyish charm. It's impish.</i>

251
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:11,307
<i>Here we go.</i>

252
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,394
<i>Nice going, imp!</i>

253
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,423
<i>It's okay. All I need to do...</i>

254
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,398
<i>...is reach over and put it</i>
<i>back in my mouth.</i>

255
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:38,242
<i>Good save!</i>
<i>We're back on track and I'm...</i>

256
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:41,335
<i>...chewing someone else's gum.</i>

257
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:46,316
<i>This is not my gum!</i>
<i>Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</i>

258
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:48,446
<i>And now you're choking.</i>

259
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,255
You aII right?

260
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:56,317
My God! You're choking!

261
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,268
-Better?
-Yes.

262
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,234
Thank you. That was....

263
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,338
-That was....
-Perfection?

264
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:33,295
That was no tousIe.

265
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:43,264
-What'd he say that was so funny?
-I have absoIuteIy no idea.

266
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:45,276
That's cIassic.

267
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:49,370
My God, you guys! What am I doing?
This is so un-me!

268
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,473
If you want, I'II do it.

269
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:56,286
I just wanna bite his bottom Iip.

270
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,381
But I won't.

271
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:02,221
The first time he smiIed at me...

272
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:06,220
...those seconds were more exciting
than weeks with Barry.

273
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,423
Did you rent mopeds?

274
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:14,337
Because I've heard--
Oh, it's not about that right now.

275
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:18,375
I know it's superficiaI,
and we have nothing in common...

276
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:22,470
...and we don't even speak
the same Ianguage, but, God!

277
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,353
-PaoIo, hi.
-Ross.

278
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,387
Listen....

279
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:38,454
Listen, something you shouId know.

280
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:42,296
RacheI and I are....

281
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,300
We're kind of a thing.

282
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,303
-Thing?
-Thing. Yes, thing.

283
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,499
-You have the sex?
-No.

284
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:57,505
No, technicaIIy the sex
is not being had. But that's....

285
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,451
But that's not the point.

286
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:05,417
The point is that
RacheI and I shouId be....

287
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:09,250
WeII, RacheI and I
shouId be together.

288
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,319
And if you get in the--

289
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,330
-In bed--
-No.

290
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,461
No, not where I was going.

291
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:21,365
If you get in the way of us
becoming a thing...

292
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,274
...then I wouId be, weII, very sad.

293
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,370
So, do you...?

294
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:38,348
-So you do know a IittIe EngIish?
-LittIe.

295
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:42,257
-Do you know the word ''crap-weaseI''?
-No.

296
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:45,491
That's funny.
You are a huge crap-weaseI.

297
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:54,497
We've been doing this
for an hour. It's easy.

298
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,365
Ready?

299
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,412
Okay? Now try it.

300
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,316
You gotta whip it.

301
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:14,224
Look, Iook. The Iast candIe's
about to burn out.

302
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:18,355
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

303
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:23,367
...minus 46, minus 47,
minus 48....

304
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,260
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

305
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:30,432
IKind of spooky without any Iights.

306
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:40,383
Okay, guys, I have the definitive one.

307
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:57,258
This probabIy isn't the best time
to bring it up...

308
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:59,566
...but you have to throw
a party for Monica.

309
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,407
-This has been fun.
-Yes.

310
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:13,214
Thanks for Ietting me
use your phone...

311
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:15,413
...and for saving my Iife.

312
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:20,450
WeII, goodbye, ChandIer.
I had a great bIackout.

313
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,251
See you.

314
00:24:38,443 --> 00:24:42,436
Hi, I'm account number 71 43457.

315
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,472
I don't know if you got that...

316
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,276
...but I wouId reaIIy
Iike a copy of the tape.
