1
00:00:05,269 --> 00:00:06,395
-Hi, guys.
-Hey, Phoebe.

2
00:00:07,204 --> 00:00:09,263
-How did it go?
-Not so good.

3
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:12,399
He waIked me home and said,
''Let's do this again.''

4
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:16,380
He said, ''Let's do this again.''
That's good, right?

5
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:22,209
TransIated, ''Let's do this again''
means, ''You'II never see me naked.''

6
00:00:23,287 --> 00:00:24,379
Since when?

7
00:00:25,222 --> 00:00:28,282
Since aIways.
It's, Iike, dating Ianguage.

8
00:00:28,326 --> 00:00:31,386
Like, ''It's not you''
means, ''It is you.''

9
00:00:33,197 --> 00:00:36,394
''You're nice'' means, ''I'II be
dating aIcohoIics...

10
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:39,226
...and compIaining
about them to you.''

11
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:42,331
''We shouId see
other peopIe'' means:

12
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,305
''Ha-ha, I aIready am!''

13
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,302
Everybody knows this?

14
00:00:48,312 --> 00:00:49,336
Cushions the bIow.

15
00:00:49,413 --> 00:00:51,438
Like your parents
putting the dog to sIeep...

16
00:00:52,249 --> 00:00:54,342
...and saying it went to a farm.

17
00:00:54,418 --> 00:00:57,410
That's funny. Because our
parents actuaIIy did...

18
00:00:58,356 --> 00:01:01,382
...send our dog off to Iive on a farm.

19
00:01:02,193 --> 00:01:03,353
Ross?

20
00:01:05,196 --> 00:01:07,391
HeIIo! The MiIner's farm
in Connecticut?

21
00:01:08,165 --> 00:01:10,292
The MiIners had this
unbeIievabIe farm.

22
00:01:10,368 --> 00:01:13,201
They had horses and
rabbits to chase.

23
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:14,396
And it was....

24
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:20,200
Oh, my God! Chi-Chi!

25
00:01:22,313 --> 00:01:25,282
The One With the Thumb

26
00:02:13,264 --> 00:02:16,199
How does it feeI knowing
you're about to die?

27
00:02:16,267 --> 00:02:19,361
Warden, in five minutes
my pain wiII be over.

28
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:24,369
But you'II Iive with the knowIedge
that you sent an honest man to die.

29
00:02:26,177 --> 00:02:28,202
That was reaIIy good!

30
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:30,179
Thanks. Let's keep going.

31
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:34,217
So, what do you want
from me, Dimon? Huh?

32
00:02:36,387 --> 00:02:40,380
I just wanna go back to my ceII,
because in my ceII I can smoke.

33
00:02:41,192 --> 00:02:43,183
Smoke away!

34
00:02:55,506 --> 00:02:59,306
I think this is why Dimon
smokes in his ceII aIone.

35
00:03:00,244 --> 00:03:02,269
-What?
-ReIax your hand.

36
00:03:02,346 --> 00:03:04,280
Let your wrist go.

37
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:06,248
Not so much!

38
00:03:07,351 --> 00:03:10,149
AII right. Now take a puff.

39
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:12,152
Right.

40
00:03:14,191 --> 00:03:17,251
-Give it to me.
-I'm not giving you a cigarette.

41
00:03:17,294 --> 00:03:21,253
It's fine. Do you want to
get this part or not? Here.

42
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:24,357
Now, don't think
of it as a cigarette.

43
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:29,202
Think of it as the thing that
has been missing from your hand.

44
00:03:29,373 --> 00:03:31,398
When you hoId it,
you feeI right.

45
00:03:32,276 --> 00:03:33,265
You feeI compIete.

46
00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:36,373
-You miss it?
-No, not so much.

47
00:03:38,182 --> 00:03:41,174
AII right. Now we smoke.

48
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,212
Oh, my God!

49
00:03:46,323 --> 00:03:48,291
-Give me that!
-No. You've got options.

50
00:03:48,392 --> 00:03:50,223
You can smoke Iike this:

51
00:03:50,294 --> 00:03:52,387
-ChandIer--
-Or hoId it in your mouth.

52
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:54,226
Give me the cigarette!

53
00:03:54,331 --> 00:03:55,491
-You try.
-Thank you.

54
00:03:56,233 --> 00:03:58,292
Okay, how's this?

55
00:04:01,138 --> 00:04:03,163
Okay, that's not bad.

56
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,267
AII right, when you're finished,
it's cooI if you fIick it.

57
00:04:09,246 --> 00:04:12,238
AII right, you keep practicing...

58
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:15,250
...and I'II go put out the sofa.

59
00:04:19,256 --> 00:04:21,281
I thought it was foot size.

60
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,294
No. It's the distance
from the tip of a guy's thumb...

61
00:04:25,362 --> 00:04:28,297
...to the tip of his index finger.

62
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,361
That's ridicuIous.

63
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:39,267
Can I use either thumb?

64
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:42,270
I'd rather go with the foot theory.

65
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:45,371
AII right. Don't teII me.

66
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:49,377
Decaf cappuccino for Joey.

67
00:04:51,222 --> 00:04:53,190
Coffee, bIack.

68
00:04:53,424 --> 00:04:56,188
Latte.

69
00:04:57,228 --> 00:04:58,320
And an iced tea.

70
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:02,165
-I'm getting good at this.
-ExceIIent!

71
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:03,325
Good for me!

72
00:05:17,348 --> 00:05:20,181
-You okay, Phoebe?
-It's not worth--

73
00:05:20,284 --> 00:05:21,444
It's my bank.

74
00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:24,245
-What did they do?
-It's nothing--

75
00:05:24,355 --> 00:05:28,189
I get my maiI and
open their monthIy ''statement.''

76
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:30,192
Easy!

77
00:05:31,462 --> 00:05:34,363
And there's $500 extra in my account.

78
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:38,292
Satan's minions at work again!

79
00:05:38,402 --> 00:05:41,269
Now I have to go deaI with them--

80
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:45,264
-What are you taIking about? IKeep it!
-It's not mine.

81
00:05:45,376 --> 00:05:47,310
If I kept it, I'd be steaIing.

82
00:05:47,378 --> 00:05:51,212
But if you spent it,
it wouId be Iike shopping.

83
00:05:53,284 --> 00:05:55,411
Say I bought a great pair of shoes.

84
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,123
IKnow what I'd hear with every step?
''Not mine. Not mine. Not mine.''

85
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:04,251
Even if I was happy
and skipping, I'd hear:

86
00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:07,263
''Not-not mine. Not-not mine.''

87
00:06:07,331 --> 00:06:09,231
We're with you. We got it.

88
00:06:10,334 --> 00:06:14,327
I'd never be abIe to enjoy it.
It'd be this giant karmic debt.

89
00:06:14,371 --> 00:06:16,362
ChandIer, what are you doing?

90
00:06:17,274 --> 00:06:19,265
What are you doing?

91
00:06:21,378 --> 00:06:24,279
Oh, gross!

92
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:27,248
-What is this?
-I'm smoking!

93
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:30,149
You've been so good for three years!

94
00:06:30,254 --> 00:06:33,246
And this is my reward.

95
00:06:34,258 --> 00:06:37,250
Think about what you went
through when you quit.

96
00:06:37,361 --> 00:06:41,195
Forget about you. Think about
what we went through!

97
00:06:41,265 --> 00:06:43,358
So this time I won't quit.

98
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,267
-Put it out!
-I'm putting it out!

99
00:06:47,371 --> 00:06:48,463
Oh, no!

100
00:06:49,206 --> 00:06:51,299
I can't drink this now.

101
00:06:55,312 --> 00:06:57,303
I'm gonna go. I've got a date.

102
00:06:57,414 --> 00:07:00,144
With AIan again?
How's it going?

103
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,243
It's going pretty good.
It's nice and we're having fun.

104
00:07:04,355 --> 00:07:06,323
When do we get to meet him?

105
00:07:06,357 --> 00:07:08,325
Let's see, it's Monday....

106
00:07:08,425 --> 00:07:10,256
-Never.
-Come on!

107
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:12,352
Not after what happened with Steve.

108
00:07:13,163 --> 00:07:17,327
What do you mean?
We Iove Steve. Steve was sexy!

109
00:07:20,337 --> 00:07:21,326
Sorry.

110
00:07:21,438 --> 00:07:24,430
I don't know how I feeI yet.
Let me figure it out.

111
00:07:25,175 --> 00:07:27,143
Then can we meet him?

112
00:07:27,177 --> 00:07:28,166
No.

113
00:07:28,245 --> 00:07:30,145
Sorry.

114
00:07:32,282 --> 00:07:35,342
Joey. Let it go.

115
00:07:39,256 --> 00:07:40,348
Why shouId they meet him?

116
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:43,353
I bring a guy home and they're Iike...

117
00:07:44,261 --> 00:07:47,355
...coyotes picking off the weak
members of the herd.

118
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:52,394
Listen, as someone who's seen
more than her share of bad beef...

119
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:56,401
...I'II teII you,
that is not such a terribIe thing.

120
00:07:57,174 --> 00:07:59,301
Your friends are just
Iooking after you.

121
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:03,107
I wish that once I'd date a guy
they Iiked.

122
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:06,341
You reaIize the odds of that
happening are sIimmer...

123
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:10,314
-...if they never get to meet the guy.
-I know.

124
00:08:10,354 --> 00:08:14,154
-Can't I whimper a IittIe bit?
-Whimper.

125
00:08:16,126 --> 00:08:17,423
Okay, I'm done.

126
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:20,253
Let it go, Ross.

127
00:08:21,231 --> 00:08:23,131
You didn't know Chi-Chi.

128
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:29,435
-Do you aII promise?
-We promise.

129
00:08:30,174 --> 00:08:31,163
We'II be good.

130
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:34,335
ChandIer, do you promise to be good?

131
00:08:42,152 --> 00:08:46,248
You can come in, but your
fiIter-tip buddy stays outside!

132
00:08:55,432 --> 00:08:59,163
''Dear Ms. Buffay.
Thank you for caIIing.

133
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:03,228
We've credited you $500.
We're sorry for the inconvenience...

134
00:09:03,307 --> 00:09:06,299
...and hope you'II accept
this footbaII phone...

135
00:09:09,346 --> 00:09:12,110
...as our gift.''
Do you beIieve it?

136
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:15,209
Now I have $1000
and a footbaII phone.

137
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,112
What bank is this?

138
00:09:20,224 --> 00:09:22,317
Okay, it's him.

139
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:25,151
-Who is it?
<i>-Alan.</i>

140
00:09:25,229 --> 00:09:27,129
ChandIer! He's here!

141
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:31,156
Do I Iook okay?

142
00:09:32,135 --> 00:09:33,227
One more button.

143
00:09:33,337 --> 00:09:35,271
CIosed! How about cIosed?

144
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,274
-I didn't know.
-Yeah.

145
00:09:39,443 --> 00:09:41,343
PIease be good.

146
00:09:41,378 --> 00:09:44,347
Remember how much you aII Iike me?

147
00:09:46,183 --> 00:09:50,347
AIan, this is everybody.
Everybody, this is AIan.

148
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:57,385
I've heard so much about
aII you guys.

149
00:10:04,368 --> 00:10:07,269
I'II caII you tomorrow. Thanks.

150
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:14,268
Let's Iet the AIan-bashing begin.

151
00:10:14,378 --> 00:10:17,211
Who's gonna take the first shot?

152
00:10:18,282 --> 00:10:19,306
Come on!

153
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:22,285
I'II go.

154
00:10:24,321 --> 00:10:26,414
Let's start with how he
kept picking--

155
00:10:27,224 --> 00:10:30,284
I'm sorry, I can't do this.
We Ioved him.

156
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:32,328
We Ioved him!

157
00:10:32,396 --> 00:10:36,298
Wait! We're taIking about someone
I'm going out with?

158
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,197
That pimento trick!

159
00:10:38,302 --> 00:10:41,328
I'II never Iook at an oIive
the same way again.

160
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:43,303
And did you notice?

161
00:10:48,345 --> 00:10:51,314
IKnow what was great?
His smiIe was crooked.

162
00:10:51,415 --> 00:10:55,408
-Yes! Like the man in the shoe!
-What shoe?

163
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,312
From the rhyme.

164
00:10:58,422 --> 00:11:00,287
<i>There was a man</i>
<i>With a crooked smile</i>

165
00:11:00,357 --> 00:11:04,191
<i>Who lived in a shoe</i>
<i>For a while</i>

166
00:11:06,363 --> 00:11:09,161
So I think AIan...

167
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:13,260
...is the yardstick by which
future boyfriends wiII be measured.

168
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,359
Future boyfriends?

169
00:11:15,172 --> 00:11:18,266
-I think this couId be ''it.''
-ReaIIy?

170
00:11:18,308 --> 00:11:22,267
I'd marry him for his
David HasseIhoff impression aIone.

171
00:11:22,312 --> 00:11:25,281
You know I'II be doing that
at parties.

172
00:11:29,186 --> 00:11:31,313
-IKnow what I Iike most?
-What?

173
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:35,383
The way he makes me feeI about myseIf.

174
00:11:57,447 --> 00:11:59,438
How was the game?

175
00:12:00,183 --> 00:12:01,275
WeII....

176
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:04,252
We won!

177
00:12:05,188 --> 00:12:08,157
Fantastic! Question.
How is that possibIe?

178
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:11,252
-AIan.
-He was unbeIievabIe!

179
00:12:11,294 --> 00:12:15,196
Like the cartoon where
Bugs Bunny pIays every position.

180
00:12:15,265 --> 00:12:19,361
It was first base, AIan.
Second base, AIan....

181
00:12:23,173 --> 00:12:25,403
It was Iike he made us into a team.

182
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:31,170
We sure showed those Hasidic jeweIers
a thing or two about softbaII.

183
00:12:32,215 --> 00:12:33,477
Can I ask a question?

184
00:12:34,217 --> 00:12:36,310
Do you think AIan is sometimes....

185
00:12:36,386 --> 00:12:37,375
What?

186
00:12:37,487 --> 00:12:40,320
I don't know. A IittIe too ''AIan''?

187
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:44,292
Oh, no. Not possibIe.
You can never be too ''AIan.''

188
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:49,287
It's his innate ''AIan-ness''
that we adore.

189
00:12:49,332 --> 00:12:52,324
I, personaIIy, couId have
a gaIIon of AIan.

190
00:13:00,177 --> 00:13:02,270
-Hey, Lizzy.
-Hey, weird girI.

191
00:13:03,246 --> 00:13:05,339
-I brought aIphabet soup.
-Pick out the voweIs?

192
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:09,141
I Ieft in the Y's.
Because, ''sometimes Y.''

193
00:13:10,253 --> 00:13:12,346
-And something eIse.
-SaItines?

194
00:13:12,456 --> 00:13:15,186
No, $1000 and a footbaII phone.

195
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,183
What?

196
00:13:18,261 --> 00:13:19,387
Oh, my God!

197
00:13:20,197 --> 00:13:22,392
-There's reaIIy money in here.
-I know.

198
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,360
What are you doing?

199
00:13:25,168 --> 00:13:28,296
I want you to have it.
I don't want it.

200
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:31,397
-I have to give you something.
-No, you don't--

201
00:13:32,209 --> 00:13:35,372
-Do you want my tinfoiI hat?
-No, you need that.

202
00:13:35,479 --> 00:13:38,380
-It's okay. Thanks.
-Let me do something.

203
00:13:40,217 --> 00:13:44,210
I'II teII you what. Buy me
a soda and we're even. Okay?

204
00:13:45,222 --> 00:13:46,416
-Okay.
-Okay.

205
00:14:48,285 --> 00:14:50,276
IKeep the change.

206
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,309
Thanks, Lizzy.

207
00:14:51,388 --> 00:14:52,412
Want a pretzeI?

208
00:14:53,223 --> 00:14:56,192
-No, I'm fine. Thanks.
-See you.

209
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:06,226
A thumb?

210
00:15:07,337 --> 00:15:10,329
I know. There it was,
just fIoating...

211
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,240
...Iike this tiny IittIe hitchhiker.

212
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:19,238
Maybe it's a contest.
Like ''coIIect aII five.''

213
00:15:20,283 --> 00:15:23,252
-Does anyone wanna see?
-No, thanks!

214
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:26,381
Don't do that. Come on!

215
00:15:27,157 --> 00:15:29,352
It's worse than the thumb.

216
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:33,356
-This is so unfair.
-Why is it unfair?

217
00:15:34,164 --> 00:15:36,359
So I have a fIaw! Big deaI!

218
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:39,362
Joey's knuckIe-cracking
isn't annoying?

219
00:15:39,402 --> 00:15:42,166
Ross, over-pronouncing every word.

220
00:15:42,205 --> 00:15:47,404
Monica, who snorts when she Iaughs.
I mean, what the heII is that thing?

221
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:53,212
I accept those fIaws.
Why can't you accept me for this?

222
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:03,248
Does the knuckIe-cracking
bother everybody, or just him?

223
00:16:06,229 --> 00:16:08,163
I couId Iive without it.

224
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:16,162
Is it a IittIe annoying? Or is it Iike
when Phoebe chews her hair?

225
00:16:18,341 --> 00:16:21,333
Don't Iisten to him.
I think it's endearing.

226
00:16:22,145 --> 00:16:24,170
Oh, you do, do you?

227
00:16:30,253 --> 00:16:33,279
There's nothing wrong with
speaking correctIy.

228
00:16:33,456 --> 00:16:36,289
Indeed there isn't.

229
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:40,261
I shouId get back to work.

230
00:16:40,363 --> 00:16:44,265
Otherwise someone might
get what they ordered.

231
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:50,296
The hair comes out
and the gIoves come off.

232
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:08,313
Ever go out with a guy
your friends reaIIy Iike?

233
00:17:08,358 --> 00:17:10,258
No.

234
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:16,160
I'm going out with a guy
my friends reaIIy Iike.

235
00:17:16,232 --> 00:17:19,224
Are we taIking about the coyotes here?

236
00:17:19,336 --> 00:17:23,238
AII right! A cow got through.

237
00:17:24,174 --> 00:17:25,232
Can you beIieve it?

238
00:17:25,342 --> 00:17:27,207
It's just, you know what?

239
00:17:27,277 --> 00:17:30,212
I just don't feeI the ''thing.''

240
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,147
They feeI the thing. I don't feeI it.

241
00:17:33,249 --> 00:17:38,186
Honey, you shouId aIways
feeI the thing.

242
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:44,190
If that's how you feeI about the guy,
dump him.

243
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,388
-It's gonna be reaIIy hard.
-He'II get over it.

244
00:17:48,164 --> 00:17:53,158
No, he'II be fine. It's the other five
I'm worried about.

245
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:57,262
-Don't you respect your body?
-Don't you see what you're doing?

246
00:17:57,374 --> 00:18:01,242
I've had it with your cancer,
emphysema and heart disease.

247
00:18:02,112 --> 00:18:06,105
The bottom Iine is, smoking is cooI,
and you know it.

248
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:11,253
AIan wants to speak to you.

249
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:13,346
ReaIIy? He does?

250
00:18:14,357 --> 00:18:17,258
Hey, buddy! What's up?

251
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:21,120
She toId you about that, huh?

252
00:18:21,364 --> 00:18:26,131
WeII, yeah. I have one now and then.
WeII, yeah, now.

253
00:18:27,137 --> 00:18:28,365
It's not that--

254
00:18:30,373 --> 00:18:32,341
WeII, that's true.

255
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:39,172
Gee, you know, no one's ever put it
Iike that before.

256
00:18:39,282 --> 00:18:42,149
WeII, okay. Thanks.

257
00:18:51,394 --> 00:18:54,158
God, he's good.

258
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:58,266
-If onIy he were a woman.
-Yeah.

259
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:04,295
Lamb Chop!

260
00:19:05,108 --> 00:19:08,134
How oId is that sock?

261
00:19:08,244 --> 00:19:12,305
If I had a sock on my hand
for 30 years, it'd be taIking too.

262
00:19:14,317 --> 00:19:19,152
I think it's time to change somebody's
nicotine patch.

263
00:19:22,358 --> 00:19:25,327
-Where's Joey?
-Joey ate my Iast stick of gum...

264
00:19:25,361 --> 00:19:27,352
...so I kiIIed him.

265
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:30,256
Do you think that was wrong?

266
00:19:32,135 --> 00:19:34,330
-I think he's across the haII.
-Thanks.

267
00:19:35,238 --> 00:19:37,229
There you go.

268
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,332
I'm aIive with pIeasure now.

269
00:19:40,376 --> 00:19:44,278
Pheebs, do you want
the rest of that Pop-Tart?

270
00:19:45,381 --> 00:19:48,350
Does anyone want
the rest of this Pop-Tart?

271
00:19:50,186 --> 00:19:52,154
Hey, I might.

272
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:54,246
I'm sorry.

273
00:19:54,357 --> 00:19:59,158
The soda peopIe gave me $ 7000
for the thumb.

274
00:20:00,296 --> 00:20:03,356
And on my way over here
I stepped in gum.

275
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:06,292
What is up with the universe?

276
00:20:06,402 --> 00:20:10,395
-What's going on?
-It's just nice when we're together.

277
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:14,301
It's nicer when everyone
gets to wear underwear.

278
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,184
PIease, guys, we have to taIk.

279
00:20:27,223 --> 00:20:29,487
Wait! I'm getting a déjà vu.

280
00:20:30,226 --> 00:20:31,284
No, I'm not.

281
00:20:34,197 --> 00:20:37,189
-We have to taIk.
-There it is!

282
00:20:39,402 --> 00:20:41,336
Okay, it's about AIan.

283
00:20:41,404 --> 00:20:46,239
Speaking of which, teII him
we're on for the Renaissance Fair.

284
00:20:46,342 --> 00:20:50,403
Before you get into that,
there's something you shouId know.

285
00:20:51,314 --> 00:20:55,250
There's reaIIy no easy way
to say this.

286
00:20:56,352 --> 00:20:59,412
I've decided to break up with AIan.

287
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:06,160
Is there somebody eIse?

288
00:21:07,463 --> 00:21:09,397
No, it's just...

289
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,464
...you know, things change.
PeopIe change.

290
00:21:13,203 --> 00:21:15,296
We didn't change.

291
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:20,399
So that's it? It's over?

292
00:21:21,277 --> 00:21:23,268
Just Iike that?

293
00:21:24,314 --> 00:21:29,377
You Iet your guard down. You start
to care about someone, and....

294
00:21:32,422 --> 00:21:35,186
-I can go on pretending--
-Okay!

295
00:21:35,225 --> 00:21:36,283
No.

296
00:21:36,326 --> 00:21:39,386
That wouIdn't be fair to me, AIan,
or to you.

297
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:41,420
WeII, who wants fair?

298
00:21:42,198 --> 00:21:46,225
I just want things back, you know,
the way they were.

299
00:21:48,238 --> 00:21:52,299
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, she's sorry. I feeI better.

300
00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:55,240
I can't beIieve this!

301
00:21:55,311 --> 00:22:00,248
With the hoIidays coming up.
I wanted him to meet my famiIy.

302
00:22:01,251 --> 00:22:04,186
I'II meet someone.
There'II be other AIans.

303
00:22:04,254 --> 00:22:05,278
Yeah, right!

304
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:14,162
-Are you guys gonna be okay?
-We'II be fine.

305
00:22:14,197 --> 00:22:16,358
We're just gonna need a IittIe time.

306
00:22:17,367 --> 00:22:19,392
I understand.

307
00:22:24,374 --> 00:22:27,172
-Wow.
-I'm reaIIy sorry.

308
00:22:27,277 --> 00:22:30,269
Yeah, I mean, I'm sorry too.

309
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:33,406
-But I'm a IittIe reIieved.
-ReIieved?

310
