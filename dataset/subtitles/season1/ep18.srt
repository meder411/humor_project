1
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:16,472
We're running Iow on résumés.

2
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:19,478
You want a job
with <i>Popular Mechanics</i>?

3
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:24,245
If you're gonna work for mechanics,
those are the ones.

4
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:29,294
Guys, I'm going for anything here.
I can't be a waitress anymore.

5
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:34,390
I'm sick of the Iousy tips.
I'm sick of being caIIed ''Excuse Me.''

6
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,565
-Paper cut! Paper cut!
-Here.

7
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:44,377
Grapefruit juice! Grapefruit juice!

8
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:48,370
Okay, we're aImost done.
OnIy 20 more to go.

9
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:53,316
-Rach, did you proofread these?
-Yeah. Why?

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,423
Nothing. I'm sure they'II be
impressed with your ''compuper'' skiIIs.

11
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:03,428
Oh, my God!
Do you think it's on aII of them?

12
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,430
No, I'm sure the Xerox machine
caught a few.

13
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:22,337
The One With the Poker

14
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:15,332
They caII this a Iove seat but I'm not
feeIing anything speciaI towards you.

15
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,245
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

16
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,442
Hi, Iadies.

17
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:33,350
Can I get you anything?
Did you bring the maiI?

18
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:37,482
-Lots of responses.
-ReaIIy? Sure, we have scones Ieft!

19
00:02:38,391 --> 00:02:39,358
Read them.

20
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:44,294
''Dear Miss Greene:
Thank you for your inquiry. However--''

21
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:50,498
-We have appIe cinnamon--
-''Dear Ms. Greene....'' Yeah, yeah! No.

22
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:56,271
-What?
-Your Visa biII is huge!

23
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,401
Give me that.

24
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,214
Linda's great.
Why won't you go out with her?

25
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,340
-I don't know.
-Is this about her...

26
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,216
...''The FIintstones couId
have reaIIy happened'' thing?

27
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:12,519
It's not just that. I want someone
who does something for me...

28
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,250
...who gets my heart pounding.

29
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,263
Who makes me....

30
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:22,457
LittIe pIaythings with yarn?

31
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,329
What?

32
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:28,340
CouId you want her more?

33
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:29,441
Who?

34
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,337
Dee, the sarcastic sister
from <i>What's Happening!!.</i>

35
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,449
Look, I'm totaIIy over her.

36
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,285
-Hi!
-Coffee?

37
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:47,485
-No, we're fine.
-Okay.

38
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,358
-Shut up!
-We're not saying anything.

39
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,303
-What?
-Joey cried Iast night.

40
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,434
-Thank you.
-We were pIaying poker--

41
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:08,306
There was chocoIate on the three.
It Iooked Iike an eight.

42
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:12,216
You shouId have seen him.
''Read them and weep!''

43
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,220
And then he did.

44
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:19,214
Now, how come you guys
have never pIayed poker with us?

45
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,320
Yeah, what is that?
Like some kind of sexist guy thing?

46
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:27,424
-It's poker, so onIy guys can pIay?
-No. Women can pIay.

47
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:32,427
Then, what is it? Some kind of, Iike,
some kind of, you know--

48
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,463
AII right, what is it?

49
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,367
There are just no women
in our game.

50
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:42,380
We just don't know any
women who know how to pIay poker.

51
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,282
That is a Iame excuse.
It's a typicaI guy response.

52
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,343
Do you know how to pIay?

53
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,454
No.

54
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,483
-But you couId teach us.
-No.

55
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:04,232
Okay, so now we draw cards.

56
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,306
So I wouIdn't need any.
I have a straight.

57
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,401
-Oh, good for you!
-CongratuIations!

58
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:18,445
-Pheebs, how many do you want?
-I just need two.

59
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,415
The 10 of spades and the 6 of cIubs.

60
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:27,256
-No, you can't--
-I have the 10 of spades! Here.

61
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,227
Thanks!

62
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,233
-No, you can't do that.
-Don't need them. I'm going for fours.

63
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:36,462
Oh, you're--

64
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:42,367
You're going for fours.
ChandIer, couId you--? Thanks, man.

65
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,438
Here we go.

66
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:52,245
We've got saImon rouIettes
and crudités.

67
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,252
What are you doing?

68
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,256
In poker, there's no food
with more than one syIIabIe.

69
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:02,294
It's got to be Iike chips
or dip or pretz--

70
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:08,390
I hope you'II Iet it sIide just
this once. I was aII out of ''pretz.''

71
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,328
Now the deaIer--

72
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:15,306
We got it. Let's pIay for reaI.
High stakes. Big bucks!

73
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:20,402
You sure? Phoebe just threw away two
jacks because they didn't Iook happy.

74
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,309
But I'm ready. So just deaI.

75
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:30,345
Okay, Iast-minute Iesson!
Joey....

76
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,254
Three.

77
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,314
Eight.

78
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,253
Eight. Three.
AII right, very good.

79
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:43,235
Damn it, damn it, damn it!

80
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,430
Joey had two fives showing,
so for you to raise was--

81
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,434
Yes?

82
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,271
Downright gutsy.

83
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:56,371
-I see, so you were Iying.
-About what?

84
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,475
-About how good your cards were.
-I was bIuffing.

85
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,184
And what is bIuffing?

86
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:08,284
Is it not another word for Iying?

87
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:13,390
Sorry to break up this party, but I've
got to go fax résumés before work.

88
00:07:13,499 --> 00:07:16,297
-We've got to settIe.
-SettIe what?

89
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,399
The Jamestown coIony of Virginia.

90
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:25,300
See, IKing George is giving us
the Iand....

91
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:32,308
-The game, RacheI. You owe us money.
-Right.

92
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:36,252
It's their first time.
Let's forget about the money.

93
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:39,222
HeII, no. We'II pay!

94
00:07:39,325 --> 00:07:42,419
Monica, I had another
answer aII ready.

95
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,425
And you know what?
We want a rematch.

96
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,334
That's fine with me.
CouId use some money.

97
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:57,232
-You're enjoying this, aren't you?
-WeII, yeah, I am.

98
00:07:57,376 --> 00:08:01,312
So you get your ya-yas
by taking money from your friends.

99
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:06,276
Yes, and I get my ya-yas from IIKEA.

100
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:12,180
You have to put them together
yourseIf, but they cost Iess.

101
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:15,326
Look, this is poker.
I pIay to win.

102
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:18,226
For me to win,
others have to Iose.

103
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:22,199
If you're gonna pIay,
don't expect me to be nice.

104
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:25,204
Because once those cards are deaIt....

105
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:35,439
Yeah?

106
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,413
I'm not a nice guy.

107
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:49,421
AII right, Iet's eat.

108
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:53,431
Did you get that
from the ''I Love RacheI Pizzeria''?

109
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:58,226
-You stiII on that?
-What was with that BIack Bart speech?

110
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:01,306
''When I pIay poker,
I'm not a nice guy.''

111
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,367
You're way off.

112
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:07,310
No, I don't think so,
because I think you Iove her!

113
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:13,184
No. I might have had feeIings
for her at one time. Not anymore.

114
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,208
I just--

115
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,414
MarceI! Where are you going
with that disk?

116
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,317
You are not putting that on again.

117
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:24,386
If you press that button,
you are in very big troubIe.

118
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:58,262
You beIieve what a jerk
Ross was being?

119
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:01,459
-Yeah, I know.
-He can get reaIIy competitive.

120
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,463
What?

121
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,365
''HeIIo, kettIe? This is Monica.
You're bIack!''

122
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,376
PIease!

123
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,338
I'm not as bad as Ross.

124
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:20,249
I beg to differ.
The Pictionary incident?

125
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,353
That wasn't an incident.

126
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:27,256
I was gesturing and the pIate
sIipped out of my hand.

127
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:34,357
-I got an interview!
-You're kidding! Where?

128
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,369
Saks Fifth Avenue.

129
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:39,303
Oh, RacheI!

130
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:43,306
It's Iike the mother ship
is caIIing you home.

131
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:50,472
-What's the job?
-Assistant buyer.

132
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,478
I wouId be shopping!

133
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,318
For a Iiving!

134
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:02,359
That's Aunt Iris. She's been
pIaying poker since she was 5.

135
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:05,420
You've got to Iisten
to every word she says.

136
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:09,234
-Is Tony RandaII dead?
-I don't think so.

137
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,463
-He may be now. I hit him with my car.
-My God, reaIIy?

138
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:16,366
No, that's bIuffing.
Lesson number one.

139
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:23,375
Let me teII you something. Everything
you hear at a poker game is pure crap!

140
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:26,282
-Nice earrings.
-Thank you.

141
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:33,290
-GirIs, sit down.
-Aunt Iris, this is Phoebe and RacheI.

142
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:37,352
Listen, I'm parked at a meter.
Let's do it. Okay?

143
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,458
We'II start with five-card draw.

144
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:46,495
Then we'II go into the studs and the
hoId 'ems. I taIked to Cousin Nathan.

145
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:50,367
Don't touch the cards
when somebody is deaIing.

146
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:56,372
How is Nathan?

147
00:11:56,415 --> 00:12:00,249
Now he thinks he's a man
in a woman's body.

148
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,311
Don't you mean
a woman in a man's body?

149
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:06,220
It shouId be so simpIe.

150
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:20,236
Ross, couId we pIease Iisten
to anything eIse?

151
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,240
AII right.

152
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,281
I'm gonna pay for that tonight.

153
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,297
Hi. Guys, guess what?

154
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:53,304
The fifth dentist caved, and now
they're aII recommending Trident?

155
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,243
No, the interview!

156
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:04,348
UnbeIievabIe!
She absoIuteIy Ioved me.

157
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,409
We taIked for over two hours.
We've the same taste in cIothes.

158
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,321
And I went to camp with her cousin.

159
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:16,226
-The job is perfect! I can do this.
-That's great!

160
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:20,323
-Then she toId a funny story.
-Great, teII us and we'II Iaugh.

161
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,357
Let's pIay poker!

162
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:28,332
Listen, we taIked about it and
if you don't wanna pIay, it's okay.

163
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,434
Yes, we can pIay some other game.
Like Pictionary?

164
00:13:35,347 --> 00:13:36,439
Very funny.

165
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:41,242
-But we'd Iike to try poker again.
-Yes, I think we shouId.

166
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:46,552
-Do you want me to shuffIe those?
-That's okay, I'm gonna give it a go.

167
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,470
So Pheebs owes $ 7.50.
Monica owes $10.00.

168
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,432
And RacheI, you owe 1 5 big ones!

169
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:08,209
Thanks for teaching us Cross-Eyed
Mary. We gotta pIay that other way.

170
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:12,446
AII right, here's my $ 7.50.
But this money is cursed.

171
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,414
-What?
-I cursed it!

172
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,453
Now bad things wiII happen
to the spender.

173
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:24,218
I'II take it.
Bad things happen to me anyway.

174
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,365
This way, I can spIit them up
with a movie.

175
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:33,235
So that just Ieaves the big Greene
poker machine, who owes 1 5.

176
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,240
CouId you be any smugger?

177
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:40,471
Let's see. Rach, I'm opening up
a new art gaIIery...

178
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:46,274
...and I couId sure use the portraits
of LincoIn and HamiIton.

179
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:51,480
It's so typicaI.
''I'm a man! I have a penis!

180
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:56,285
I have to win money
to exert my power over women!''

181
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:00,389
This isn't over.

182
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:04,225
We'II pIay you again.
We'II win. You'II Iose.

183
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,203
You'II beg. We'II Iaugh.

184
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:11,333
We'II take every Iast dime you have.
And you'II hate yourseIves forever!

185
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:16,438
IKind of stepped on
my point there, Mon.

186
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:20,310
I can't beIieve you Iost!
How much did they take?

187
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,353
Like 30 bucks.

188
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:25,321
-I'II give you that money back.
-ReaIIy?

189
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:29,360
No, I'm bIuffing!
You guys haven't Iearned crap!

190
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,526
-Hand me the cards!
-Can I?

191
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,529
Yes!

192
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:49,238
Wanna give us your money now? We can
skip the formaIity of reaIIy pIaying.

193
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:53,375
No, that's fine. We'II see who has
the Iast Iaugh, monkey boy.

194
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:59,448
Done with chitchat?
Ready for serious poker?

195
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:03,427
You guys, Iook! The one-eyed jack
foIIows me wherever I go.

196
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,198
Right. Serious poker.

197
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:11,497
-Mon, got any more of those saImon--?
-You want to eat or pIay poker?

198
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:15,297
-Where are you going?
-To the bathroom.

199
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:18,310
Want to go to the bathroom
or pIay poker?

200
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,244
Go to the bathroom.

201
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:25,249
-WeII, I'm gonna order a pizza.
-No!

202
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:30,311
I'm waiting to hear from that job.
The store cIoses at 9:00. Eat then.

203
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:34,417
That's fine. I'II just have a Tic Tac
to hoId me over.

204
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,423
AII right. Cincinnati. No bIinds.
Everybody, ante.

205
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:40,463
Yes!

206
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,235
Or no.

207
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:51,232
-AII right! Your money's mine, Greene.
-Your fIy's open, GeIIer.

208
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:02,414
You know what I just reaIized?
Joker is poker with a ''J''!

209
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:06,383
Coincidence?

210
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,424
That's jo-incidence with a ''C''!

211
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:25,401
-Phoebe?
-Yeah, I'm out.

212
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:29,313
-I'm in.
-Me too.

213
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,315
Me too.
What do you got?

214
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:36,449
You better hop out of the shower,
because I got a fIush.

215
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,323
WeII, weII, weII!

216
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:46,330
Hop back in, bucko,
because I got four sixes!

217
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:50,425
I got four sixes! I won!
I actuaIIy won! Oh, my God!

218
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,228
You know what?
I'II make a IittIe Ross piIe.

219
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,330
Look!

220
00:17:55,441 --> 00:18:00,276
I think that one was Ross'.
And I think that one was Ross'.

221
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:05,372
<i>Well, I have got your money</i>
<i>And you'll never see it</i>

222
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,210
<i>And your fly's still open</i>

223
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,288
<i>I made you look</i>

224
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,419
-I'm in.
-I couIdn't be in-er.

225
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,390
Monica, in or out?

226
00:18:19,198 --> 00:18:21,223
I hate this game!

227
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,334
Joey, your bet.

228
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,435
I foId Iike a hooker
who got hit in the stomach...

229
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:37,238
...by a fat guy
with sores on his face.

230
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:41,443
I'm out.

231
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:46,415
-Ross?
-I'm very in.

232
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,351
-ChandIer?
-CouIdn't be more out.

233
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:52,363
Me too. RacheI?

234
00:18:52,531 --> 00:18:58,470
I wiII see you and I'II raise you.
Do you wanna waste another buck?

235
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,304
No, not this time.
What did you have?

236
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,375
-I'm not teIIing.
-Show them.

237
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,398
-No.
-Show them!

238
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:10,204
-Get your hands out of there!
-I've had dates Iike this.

239
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,309
Boy, you reaIIy can't stand
to Iose, can you?

240
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:21,188
Your whoIe face is getting red.
Veins popping out of your tempIe!

241
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:24,387
PIus, that shirt doesn't reaIIy
match those pants.

242
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,393
-I'm not Iosing.
-You're definiteIy Iosing.

243
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,195
HeIIo. RacheI Greene.

244
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,409
Excuse me. It's about the job!

245
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:41,404
Barbara, hi! How are you?

246
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,410
No, I understand.

247
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:54,349
Come on. No, I'm fine.
Don't be siIIy. Yeah.

248
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:58,362
But if anything eIse
opens up, pIease--

249
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,330
HeIIo?

250
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,441
Sorry, Rach.

251
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,287
There's gonna be Iots
of other stuff.

252
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,481
Okay.

253
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,458
Where were we?

254
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:34,365
Five-card draw. Jacks are better.
Nothing wiId. Everybody, ante.

255
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,498
-Look, Rach, we don't have to do this.
-Yes, we do.

256
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,365
-AII right. Check.
-Check.

257
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:47,502
-I'm in for 50 cents.
-CaII.

258
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,508
I'm in.

259
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,509
I see your 50 cents...

260
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:56,413
...and I raise you $5.

261
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:59,482
I thought it was a 50-cent Iimit.

262
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,454
I just Iost a job,
I'd Iike to raise it $5.

263
00:21:03,228 --> 00:21:05,355
Does anyone have
a probIem with that?

264
00:21:06,231 --> 00:21:08,256
-Not at aII.
-No.

265
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,531
Loser?

266
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,439
-No, I foId.
-What do you mean, you foId?

267
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:30,347
I thought that, ''Once the cards
are deaIt, I'm not a nice guy.''

268
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,288
Were you just fuII of it?

269
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:47,360
I'm in.

270
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,364
-How many do you want?
-One.

271
00:21:51,576 --> 00:21:53,510
DeaIer takes two.

272
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,305
-What do you bet?
-I bet $2.

273
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:01,418
Okay. I see your $2...

274
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:04,354
...and I raise you...

275
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:07,357
...20.

276
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,265
I see your $20...

277
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,325
...raise you $25.

278
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:26,467
I see your $25
and Monica, get my purse.

279
00:22:32,451 --> 00:22:35,284
RacheI, there's nothing in it.

280
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,482
Okay, then get me your purse.

281
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:46,464
-Here you go. Good Iuck!
-Thank you.

282
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,494
I saw your $25 and I raise you...

283
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,361
...seven.

284
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:55,398
--teen!

285
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:06,215
Joey, I'm a IittIe shy.

286
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:09,344
That's okay, Ross. You can ask me.

287
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,351
-What do you need?
-1 5.

288
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:19,420
-Here's 10.
-I got 5.

289
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:21,455
-Thank you.
-Good Iuck.

290
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:25,435
I am caIIing your 1 7.

291
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,438
What do you got?

292
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,341
FuII house.

293
00:23:46,491 --> 00:23:48,356
You got me.

294
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,398
-That's tough to beat.
-I thought we had it!

295
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:05,438
When you don't have the cards,
you don't have the cards.

296
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,337
But Iook how happy she is.

297
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:21,325
-AirmaiI.
-AirpIane. Airport. <i>Airport '75</i>!

298
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,419
<i>Airport '77</i>! <i>Airport '79</i>!

299
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,230
Time's up!

300
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:29,460
<i>Bye Bye Birdie</i>!

301
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,427
That's a bird?

302
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,332
That's a bird!

303
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,369
Okay, it's my turn.

304
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:42,338
Go!

305
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:47,247
Bean! Bean!

306
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:51,253
<i>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</i>!

307
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,553

That you get?!
