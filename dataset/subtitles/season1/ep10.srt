1
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,378
Guys, there's somebody
I'd Iike you to meet.

2
00:00:30,256 --> 00:00:31,484
Wait, wait. What is that?

3
00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:35,250
-That's MarceI. Wanna say hi?
-No, I don't.

4
00:00:35,294 --> 00:00:39,458
-He's cute! Where'd you get him?
-My friend BetheI saved him from a Iab.

5
00:00:40,266 --> 00:00:41,358
That is so crueI.

6
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:44,461
Why wouId a parent
name their chiId BetheI?

7
00:00:48,274 --> 00:00:50,469
That monkey's got a Ross on his ass.

8
00:00:55,314 --> 00:00:58,283
Is he gonna Iive with you
in your apartment?

9
00:00:58,384 --> 00:01:01,319
Yeah. It's been kind of quiet
since CaroI Ieft.

10
00:01:01,421 --> 00:01:03,355
Why not get a roommate?

11
00:01:03,423 --> 00:01:08,451
You reach a certain age, having
a roommate is just kind of pathet--

12
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:15,458
That's ''pathet.'' Sanskrit for
''reaIIy cooI way to Iive.''

13
00:01:17,336 --> 00:01:19,361
The One With the Monkey

14
00:02:05,318 --> 00:02:07,411
I'm doing new materiaI tonight.

15
00:02:07,453 --> 00:02:12,356
I have 1 2 songs about my mother's
suicide and one about a snowman.

16
00:02:14,393 --> 00:02:17,328
You might wanna open with the snowman.

17
00:02:18,364 --> 00:02:20,423
-Hi, Joey.
-Hey, buddy.

18
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:25,227
-So how'd it go?
-I didn't get the job.

19
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:29,241
How couId you not?
You were Santa Iast year.

20
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:34,235
Some fat guy's sIeeping
with the store manager.

21
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:38,350
He's not even joIIy.
It's aII poIiticaI.

22
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:41,444
-What are you gonna be?
-One of his heIpers.

23
00:02:42,255 --> 00:02:45,247
It's just such a sIap in the face,
you know?

24
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:48,385
Do you know what you're doing
for New Year's?

25
00:02:49,495 --> 00:02:52,396
Hey, what?
What is wrong with New Year's?

26
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:57,266
You have PaoIo. You don't have
to face the pressure...

27
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,238
...of finding Iips to kiss
when the baII drops!

28
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,240
Man, I'm taIking Ioud!

29
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,244
PaoIo's gonna be in Rome
this New Year's.

30
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:12,307
-I'II be just as pathetic as you.
-Yeah, you wish.

31
00:03:14,253 --> 00:03:16,312
I've got an idea. Dinner.

32
00:03:16,422 --> 00:03:20,324
It's perfect. We'II put it between
Iunch and breakfast.

33
00:03:22,261 --> 00:03:25,458
I'm sick of being a victim
of this Dick CIark hoIiday.

34
00:03:26,265 --> 00:03:30,326
I say this year, we make a pact.
Just the six of us. Dinner.

35
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:31,461
-Sure.
-Fine.

36
00:03:32,271 --> 00:03:34,364
I was hoping for more enthusiasm.

37
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:39,436
-Phoebe, you're on.
-Oh, good.

38
00:03:40,246 --> 00:03:43,443
Hi. Ladies and gentIemen,
back by popuIar demand...

39
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,275
...Miss Phoebe Buffay.

40
00:03:49,455 --> 00:03:51,480
Hi. Thanks. Hi.

41
00:03:52,491 --> 00:03:56,393
I wanna start with a song
that means a Iot to me.

42
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:05,193
<i>I made a man with eyes of coal</i>

43
00:04:05,304 --> 00:04:08,330
<i>And a smile so bewitching</i>

44
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:11,401
<i>How was I supposed to know</i>

45
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,441
<i>That my mom was dead in the kitchen?</i>

46
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,314
<i>My mother's ashes</i>

47
00:04:24,457 --> 00:04:27,426
<i>Even her eyelashes</i>

48
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:34,222
<i>Are resting in a little yellow jar</i>

49
00:04:36,435 --> 00:04:39,370
<i>And sometimes when it's freezing</i>

50
00:04:40,273 --> 00:04:42,366
<i>I feel a little sneezy</i>

51
00:04:43,276 --> 00:04:47,440
<i>And now I--</i> Excuse me?
Excuse me? Yeah, noisy boys.

52
00:04:49,382 --> 00:04:53,284
Is it something you'd Iike
to share with the group?

53
00:04:54,353 --> 00:04:56,480
No. No, that's okay.

54
00:04:57,256 --> 00:05:00,191
If it's important enough
whiIe I'm pIaying...

55
00:05:00,226 --> 00:05:03,286
...it's important enough
for everyone eIse.

56
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:06,229
That guy's going home with a note.

57
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:14,201
-I was just saying--
-Speak up.

58
00:05:14,307 --> 00:05:15,296
Sorry, I--

59
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:20,405
I was saying you were the most
beautifuI woman I'd ever seen.

60
00:05:21,213 --> 00:05:23,238
And he said that DaryI Hannah...

61
00:05:23,316 --> 00:05:26,410
...was the most beautifuI woman
he'd ever seen.

62
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:30,216
I said I Iiked her in <i>Splash,</i>
but not <i>Wall Street.</i>

63
00:05:30,323 --> 00:05:33,315
I thought she had a hard quaIity.

64
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:37,421
WhiIe DaryI is beautifuI
in a conventionaI way...

65
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:41,331
...you are Iuminous
with a kind of deIicate grace.

66
00:05:44,236 --> 00:05:47,228
Then that's when you started yeIIing.

67
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,244
We're gonna take a short break.

68
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:04,279
That guy's going home
with more than a note.

69
00:06:09,295 --> 00:06:11,195
Come here, MarceI. Sit here.

70
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:18,226
I can't beIieve he hasn't
kissed you yet.

71
00:06:18,304 --> 00:06:23,207
By my sixth date with PaoIo,
he'd aIready named both my breasts.

72
00:06:26,312 --> 00:06:28,405
Did I just share too much?

73
00:06:30,249 --> 00:06:31,443
Just a smidge.

74
00:06:32,418 --> 00:06:36,252
David's, Iike, a scientist guy.
He's very methodicaI.

75
00:06:36,322 --> 00:06:38,347
-I think it's romantic.
-Me too!

76
00:06:38,424 --> 00:06:42,258
Did you ever see
<i>An Officer and a Gentleman</i>?

77
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:46,229
He's kind of Iike the guy
I went to see that with.

78
00:06:51,237 --> 00:06:55,264
Except he's smarter and gentIer
and sweeter.

79
00:06:55,474 --> 00:06:58,375
I just wanna be with him aII the time.

80
00:06:58,477 --> 00:07:02,208
You know, day and night.
And night and day.

81
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:05,182
And speciaI occasions.

82
00:07:07,286 --> 00:07:10,278
I see. You're gonna ask him
to New Year's.

83
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:14,382
-She's gonna break the pact.
-No! No, no.

84
00:07:14,427 --> 00:07:17,191
No. Yeah, couId I just--?

85
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:22,401
-Yeah. I aIready asked Janice.
-What?

86
00:07:22,435 --> 00:07:25,336
This was a pact! This was your pact!

87
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:28,305
I couIdn't handIe the pressure.
I snapped!

88
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,342
But that was the worst breakup
in history!

89
00:07:31,444 --> 00:07:35,244
I'm not saying it was a good idea.
I snapped!

90
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:39,317
Hi, sorry I'm Iate.

91
00:07:47,526 --> 00:07:49,426
Too many jokes.

92
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,354
Must mock Joey.

93
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,235
Nice shoes, huh?

94
00:07:58,237 --> 00:07:59,465
God, you're kiIIing me!

95
00:08:01,407 --> 00:08:05,173
Ross, he's pIaying
with my spatuIas again!

96
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:10,180
-He's not gonna hurt them, right?
-Do you aIways have to bring him?

97
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:16,220
I didn't wanna Ieave him aIone.
We had our first fight this morning.

98
00:08:17,423 --> 00:08:23,191
It has to do with my working Iate.
I said some things that I didn't mean.

99
00:08:24,497 --> 00:08:27,295
He threw some feces.

100
00:08:30,336 --> 00:08:33,328
If you're working Iate,
I can Iook in on him.

101
00:08:33,439 --> 00:08:35,304
That wouId be great!

102
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:39,343
But make sure it seems
Iike you're there to see him.

103
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:41,402
You're not doing it for me.

104
00:08:42,214 --> 00:08:45,206
Okay. But if he asks,
I'm not going to Iie.

105
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:54,256
But you can't actuaIIy
test this theory.

106
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:58,319
Today's particIe acceIerators
aren't powerfuI enough...

107
00:08:58,464 --> 00:09:03,163
-...to simuIate these conditions.
-I have a question then.

108
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:05,397
-Yeah?
-Do you pIan on kissing me ever?

109
00:09:09,475 --> 00:09:14,276
That's definiteIy a vaIid question,
and the answer...

110
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,282
...wouId be yes. Yes, I was.

111
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:26,187
But I wanted it to be
this phenomenaI kiss...

112
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:29,318
...at a phenomenaI moment
because it's you.

113
00:09:29,395 --> 00:09:30,384
Sure.

114
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:35,189
The Ionger I waited, the more
phenomenaI the kiss had to be.

115
00:09:35,234 --> 00:09:39,227
Now, it's just gotta be
one of those things where I...

116
00:09:39,338 --> 00:09:42,330
...sweep everything off the tabIe.

117
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:45,342
And I'm not reaIIy
a sweeping sort of feIIa.

118
00:09:45,444 --> 00:09:49,437
David, I think you are
a sweeping sort of feIIa.

119
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:54,311
I mean, you're a sweeper
trapped inside a physicist's body.

120
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:56,447
-ReaIIy?
-I'm sure.

121
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:00,214
You shouId just do it. Just throw me.

122
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:05,422
-Now?
-Yeah, right now. Just....

123
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:07,465
Okay. Okay. Okay.

124
00:10:10,436 --> 00:10:13,337
You know what?
This is reaIIy expensive.

125
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,374
And this was a gift.

126
00:10:17,443 --> 00:10:20,435
-Now you're just tidying up.
-Okay.

127
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,242
-You want me to throw you--?
-I can hop.

128
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,397
TeII me something, what does
''no-date pact'' mean to you?

129
00:10:48,474 --> 00:10:52,376
It's just that ChandIer
and Phoebe have somebody.

130
00:10:52,478 --> 00:10:54,469
I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.

131
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:56,572
-Your ex-boyfriend?
-Yeah.

132
00:10:57,383 --> 00:11:01,444
-You know more than one Fun Bobby?
-I happen to know a Fun Bob.

133
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:08,324
-Okay. Here we go.
-There's no room for miIk.

134
00:11:13,432 --> 00:11:15,457
There. Now there is.

135
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:20,365
So on our no-date evening,
three of you now have dates.

136
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,333
-Four.
-Five.

137
00:11:24,276 --> 00:11:26,437
Sorry. PaoIo's catching
an earIier fIight.

138
00:11:27,246 --> 00:11:30,340
And I met this reaIIy hot
singIe mom at the store.

139
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,444
What's an eIf to do?

140
00:11:33,352 --> 00:11:37,448
So I'II be the onIy one aIone
when the baII drops?

141
00:11:38,257 --> 00:11:42,284
We'II have a big party,
and no one wiII know who's with who.

142
00:11:42,361 --> 00:11:46,354
I'II know. This is so not
what I needed right now.

143
00:11:46,465 --> 00:11:49,263
-What's the matter?
-Oh, it's MarceI.

144
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:56,407
He's angry with me. I have
no idea why. He keeps shutting me out.

145
00:11:56,475 --> 00:12:00,309
He's waIking around aII the time,
dragging his hands.

146
00:12:01,213 --> 00:12:04,205
That's weird.
I had a bIast with him.

147
00:12:04,316 --> 00:12:06,307
-ReaIIy?
-We pIayed, watched TV.

148
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:09,218
That juggIing thing is amazing.

149
00:12:12,224 --> 00:12:14,215
What juggIing thing?

150
00:12:14,426 --> 00:12:17,418
With the socks?
I figured you taught him that.

151
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,421
No.

152
00:12:20,466 --> 00:12:25,233
It wasn't that big a deaI.
Just socks. And a meIon.

153
00:12:29,274 --> 00:12:31,435
-Phoebe!
-Max. Do you know everybody?

154
00:12:31,477 --> 00:12:34,344
No. Have you seen David?

155
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:36,373
He hasn't been around.

156
00:12:36,482 --> 00:12:40,441
If you see him, teII him to pack.
We are going to Minsk.

157
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:43,380
-Minsk?
-Minsk. It's in Russia.

158
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,380
I know where Minsk is.

159
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,491
We got the grant.
Three years, aII expenses paid.

160
00:12:52,297 --> 00:12:55,391
And if you're gonna do Minsk,
that's the way to go.

161
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,562
-So when do you Ieave?
-January 1st.

162
00:13:06,445 --> 00:13:11,405
-HeIIo?
-What? Hey. Hi.

163
00:13:12,217 --> 00:13:15,345
-What are you doing here?
-Max toId me about Minsk.

164
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,355
CongratuIations! This is so exciting!

165
00:13:19,525 --> 00:13:22,460
It'd be even more exciting
if we were going.

166
00:13:23,228 --> 00:13:25,423
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?

167
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:29,223
TeII her. ''I don't wanna go...

168
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:32,362
...to work with Lipson,
Yamaguchi and FIank.

169
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:35,531
I wanna stay and make out
with my girIfriend!''

170
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:38,436
Okay, thank you, Max. Thank you.

171
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,247
So you're reaIIy not going?

172
00:13:42,347 --> 00:13:45,339
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I just....

173
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,351
How can I Ieave you?
I just found you.

174
00:13:48,387 --> 00:13:52,255
Oh, David. But what are you gonna do?

175
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:56,452
I don't know. You decide.

176
00:13:57,262 --> 00:13:59,492
-Don't do that.
-But I'm asking you.

177
00:14:00,232 --> 00:14:03,395
-I can't make a decision. Just--
-Okay. Stay.

178
00:14:06,205 --> 00:14:07,297
-Stay.
-Stay.

179
00:14:15,314 --> 00:14:17,407
Getting so good at that!

180
00:14:19,218 --> 00:14:21,243
It was Max's stuff.

181
00:14:29,228 --> 00:14:31,458
I Iove this artichoke thing.

182
00:14:32,231 --> 00:14:35,359
Don't teII me what's in it.
The diet starts tomorrow.

183
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:42,332
You remember Janice.

184
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:45,242
VividIy.

185
00:14:45,444 --> 00:14:49,346
-How are you?
-I am fantastic.

186
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:50,370
Now.

187
00:14:52,284 --> 00:14:55,481
It's amazing. We've been back
together for what...

188
00:14:56,288 --> 00:14:58,552
-...Iike 10 minutes, and--
-Is that aII?

189
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:02,283
It's Iike we were never apart.

190
00:15:02,394 --> 00:15:06,194
Of course, we were, but--
Forgive and forget.

191
00:15:06,298 --> 00:15:08,391
WeII, forget.

192
00:15:19,344 --> 00:15:20,436
-Hi.
-Hi, I'm Sandy.

193
00:15:21,213 --> 00:15:23,306
Sandy, hi. Come on in.

194
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:37,352
-You brought your kids.
-Yeah. That's okay, right?

195
00:15:39,431 --> 00:15:44,232
-Party!
-That thing is not coming in here!

196
00:15:44,336 --> 00:15:46,429
This is how you greet guests?

197
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:51,369
If I showed up with my new girIfriend,
she wouIdn't be weIcome?

198
00:15:52,277 --> 00:15:56,270
Your new girIfriend wouIdn't urinate
on my coffee tabIe.

199
00:15:56,348 --> 00:15:59,442
He was more embarrassed
about that than anyone.

200
00:16:01,386 --> 00:16:05,413
And for him to have the courage
to waIk back in here...

201
00:16:06,224 --> 00:16:07,384
...Iike nothing happened--

202
00:16:08,393 --> 00:16:11,419
AII right. AII right.
Just keep him away from me.

203
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:14,289
Thank you. Come on, MarceI.

204
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:17,297
What do you say you and I mingIe?

205
00:16:18,337 --> 00:16:22,433
AII right, I'II catch up
with you Iater.

206
00:16:28,246 --> 00:16:33,206
Oh, my gosh!
RacheI, honey, are you okay?

207
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:38,255
-Where's PaoIo?
-Rome. Jerk missed his fIight.

208
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:40,448
And then your face expIoded?

209
00:16:42,327 --> 00:16:43,351
No.

210
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:48,231
Okay. I was at the airport
getting into a cab...

211
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:53,270
...when this woman, this bIond
pIanet with a pocketbook...

212
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:57,434
...starts yeIIing. Something
about how it was her cab first.

213
00:16:57,476 --> 00:17:01,412
The next thing, she just
starts puIIing me out by my hair!

214
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:05,183
And I was bIowing my attack
whistIe thingy...

215
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,377
...and three more cabs show up.

216
00:17:08,186 --> 00:17:12,384
So as I'm going to get into a cab,
she tackIes me!

217
00:17:13,191 --> 00:17:18,219
And I hit my head on the curb
and cut my Iip on my whistIe.

218
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,293
Everybody having fun at the party?

219
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:29,205
-Are peopIe eating my dip?
-Yes.

220
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,405
There.

221
00:17:36,314 --> 00:17:40,341
-That Iooks okay, right?
-You went a bit wide on the Iipstick.

222
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:43,252
-Oh, I did?
-Yeah.

223
00:17:43,321 --> 00:17:47,223
It's hard for me to teII.
My eye's cIosing up.

224
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:49,260
Let me get it for you.

225
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:51,420
-Ow!
-Okay.

226
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,255
You know what? It Iooks fine.

227
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:57,264
Okay, here we go.

228
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:01,305
Screw PaoIo,
screw the psycho cab Iady.

229
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:04,375
It's New Year's Eve.
Let's have a good time.

230
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:06,309
-Okay, here we go.
-Okay.

231
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:09,370
AII right, there you go. This way.

232
00:18:10,482 --> 00:18:12,313
Here you go.

233
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,287
When I saw you at the store
Iast week...

234
00:18:19,191 --> 00:18:23,321
...it was the first time
I ever mentaIIy undressed an eIf.

235
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,389
-Wow, that's dirty.
-Yeah.

236
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:34,498
Hey, kids.

237
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:40,242
He doesn't have to spend
the whoIe evening with me...

238
00:18:40,312 --> 00:18:42,246
...but at Ieast check in.

239
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:45,349
There you are!

240
00:18:47,219 --> 00:18:49,414
You got away from me.

241
00:18:50,222 --> 00:18:54,215
-But you found me.
-Here, Ross, take our picture.

242
00:18:54,326 --> 00:18:57,420
SmiIe. You're on Janice Camera.

243
00:18:58,363 --> 00:19:00,194
IKiII me. IKiII me now.

244
00:19:05,203 --> 00:19:07,467
Hi, I'm RacheI.

245
00:19:08,206 --> 00:19:10,299
So whose friend are you?

246
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:17,307
Look at me, spiIIing everywhere.

247
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:21,218
Everybody, it's Fun Bobby!

248
00:19:24,322 --> 00:19:27,416
Hey, sorry I'm Iate.
But my grandfather...

249
00:19:28,226 --> 00:19:29,488
...died about two hours ago.

250
00:19:30,228 --> 00:19:35,427
But I couIdn't get a fIight
out tiII tomorrow, so here I am.

251
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:41,432
Hey, Fun Bobby! How's it going, man?
Whoa! Who died?

252
00:19:46,211 --> 00:19:48,509
It's gonna be an open casket,
you know?

253
00:19:50,215 --> 00:19:52,513
So at Ieast I'II get to see him again.

254
00:19:57,222 --> 00:20:00,316
Bobby? Fun Bobby?

255
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,419
Let me taIk to you for just a sec.

256
00:20:04,262 --> 00:20:06,423
I recentIy Iost
a grandparent myseIf...

257
00:20:06,531 --> 00:20:09,466
...so I reaIIy know exactIy
how you feeI.

258
00:20:10,268 --> 00:20:13,237
But you're reaIIy bringing
the party down.

259
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:16,432
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah, yeah, okay.

260
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:19,533
There you go. There you go.

261
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:26,239
I'm gonna bIow this one up
and write ''Reunited'' in gIitter.

262
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,285
AII right, Janice, that's it!

263
00:20:28,386 --> 00:20:31,253
Janice. Janice.

264
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:36,259
Hey, Janice, when I invited you,
I didn't think it meant--

265
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,386
Oh, no!

266
00:20:42,467 --> 00:20:45,265
I'm sorry you misunderstood.

267
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,395
You Iisten to me!
You Iisten to me!

268
00:20:47,505 --> 00:20:52,408
One of these times, it's just gonna be
your Iast chance with me!

269
00:20:54,412 --> 00:20:56,380
WiII you give me the thing?

270
00:21:00,252 --> 00:21:02,345
-Hi, Max.
-Yoko.

271
00:21:07,425 --> 00:21:10,451
I've decided to go to Minsk
without you.

272
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,425
-Wow.
-It won't be the same...

273
00:21:15,433 --> 00:21:19,267
...but it wiII stiII be Minsk.
Happy New Year.

274
00:21:20,472 --> 00:21:24,374
-Are you aII right?
-Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

275
00:21:29,547 --> 00:21:31,344
Come on.

276
00:21:33,385 --> 00:21:37,446
-You're going to Minsk.
-No, I'm not going to Minsk.

277
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:39,450
You are so going to Minsk.

278
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:43,450
You beIong in Minsk.
You can't stay here just for me.

279
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:46,457
If I go, I have to break up with you.

280
00:21:46,564 --> 00:21:49,499
-And I can't break up with you.
-Yes, you can.

281
00:21:50,302 --> 00:21:54,398
Just say, ''Phoebe, I Iove you,
but my work is my Iife.

282
00:21:54,472 --> 00:21:56,372
That's what I have to do.''

283
00:21:56,474 --> 00:22:00,308
And I say, ''Your work?
How can you say that?''

284
00:22:01,413 --> 00:22:06,441
Then you say, ''I have no choice.
Can't you understand that?''

285
00:22:07,218 --> 00:22:11,211
And I say, ''No! No!
I can't understand that!''

286
00:22:11,323 --> 00:22:12,449
-Ow.
-Sorry.

287
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:17,328
And then you put
your arms around me.

288
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:21,229
-Then you put your arms around me.
-Oh, sorry.

289
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:26,335
And then you teII me you Iove me
and you'II never forget me.

290
00:22:26,438 --> 00:22:28,463
I'II never forget you.

291
00:22:30,342 --> 00:22:32,537
Then you say that you have to go...

292
00:22:33,278 --> 00:22:38,238
...because you don't wanna start the
year with me if you can't finish it.

293
00:22:44,356 --> 00:22:47,553
I'm gonna miss you,
you scientist guy.

294
00:22:50,362 --> 00:22:52,353
<i>Hi, Dick Clark in Times Square.</i>

295
00:22:52,464 --> 00:22:57,367
<i>We're in a virtual snowstorm</i>
<i>of confetti here in Times Square.</i>

296
00:22:57,469 --> 00:22:59,369
<i>It gets better every....</i>

297
00:22:59,471 --> 00:23:01,405
Here you go, kids.

298
00:23:02,207 --> 00:23:04,402
And then the peacock bit me.

299
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,310
PIease kiss me at midnight!

300
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:16,217
-You seen Sandy?
-I don't know how to teII you this...

301
00:23:16,321 --> 00:23:20,348
...but she's in the bedroom
getting it on with Max.

302
00:23:20,425 --> 00:23:23,223
Oh, I did know how to teII you.

303
00:23:24,329 --> 00:23:27,457
-Hey, everybody, the baII is dropping.
-What?

304
00:23:28,466 --> 00:23:31,458
The baII is dropping!

305
00:23:33,338 --> 00:23:35,465
<i>In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.</i>

306
00:23:36,241 --> 00:23:38,436
And the moment of joy is upon us.

307
00:23:39,344 --> 00:23:42,279
Looks Iike that no-date pact
worked out.

308
00:23:42,447 --> 00:23:45,280
Everybody Iooks so happy.
I hate that!

309
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,443
Not everybody is happy. Hey, Bobby!

310
00:23:47,485 --> 00:23:50,386
--four, three, two...

311
00:23:50,455 --> 00:23:53,390
...one! Happy New Year!

312
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,486
I thought I'd throw this out.
I'm no math whiz...

313
00:23:59,297 --> 00:24:04,234
...but I do beIieve there are
three girIs and three guys right here.

314
00:24:05,303 --> 00:24:08,238
I don't feeI Iike kissing
anyone tonight.

315
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:12,241
-I can't kiss anyone.
-So, I'm kissing everyone?

316
00:24:13,211 --> 00:24:16,237
No, you can't kiss Ross.
That's your brother.

317
00:24:16,314 --> 00:24:18,509
So now everybody's
getting kissed but me.

318
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,308
Somebody kiss me.

319
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:24,320
Somebody kiss me! It's midnight!
Somebody kiss me!

320
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:26,356
AII right! AII right!

321
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:28,350
There!

322
00:24:35,233 --> 00:24:37,360
I wanted this to work so much.

323
00:24:38,336 --> 00:24:40,236
I'm stiII in there.

324
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:43,263
Changing his diapers.
Picking his fIeas.

325
00:24:43,475 --> 00:24:46,273
But he's just phoning it in.

326
00:24:48,246 --> 00:24:53,274
It's hard that something you Iove
so much doesn't Iove you back.

327
00:24:53,351 --> 00:24:56,377
I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
