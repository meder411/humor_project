1
00:00:01,421 --> 00:00:04,322
Do you think they have
yesterday's <i>Daily News</i>?

2
00:00:04,424 --> 00:00:08,190
I just wanna check my horoscope,
see if it was right.

3
00:00:09,295 --> 00:00:12,492
Oh, my God! Don't Iook now.
Behind you there's a guy...

4
00:00:13,232 --> 00:00:17,293
...who can break our hearts
and pIunge us into depression.

5
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:20,338
Come to mama.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,401
He's coming.
Be cooI. Be cooI. Be cooI.

7
00:00:23,443 --> 00:00:26,207
-Nice hat.
-Thanks.

8
00:00:26,412 --> 00:00:29,313
-We shouId do something. WhistIe.
-I'm not whistIing.

9
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:30,338
Come on, do it!

10
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,475
Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.

11
00:00:38,324 --> 00:00:40,417
I can't beIieve you did that.

12
00:00:41,427 --> 00:00:43,418
The One With Mrs. Bing

13
00:01:28,341 --> 00:01:31,208
-It's aII my fauIt.
-No, it's mine.

14
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,210
Why did I whoo-hoo?

15
00:01:33,246 --> 00:01:35,339
Was I hoping
he'd turn around and say...

16
00:01:35,415 --> 00:01:38,441
...''I Iove that sound.
I must have you now''?

17
00:01:39,419 --> 00:01:42,320
I wish there was something
we couId do.

18
00:01:45,224 --> 00:01:46,248
HeIIo, coma guy.

19
00:01:48,227 --> 00:01:50,218
Get up, you GirI Scout!
Up, up, up!

20
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:51,353
What are you doing?

21
00:01:51,464 --> 00:01:53,432
Maybe nobody's tried this.

22
00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:58,462
I wish we at Ieast knew his name.

23
00:01:59,238 --> 00:02:01,365
I hate that they're
caIIing him John Doe.

24
00:02:01,474 --> 00:02:05,308
It's so sad. It's Iike he's a deer,
a femaIe deer.

25
00:02:06,212 --> 00:02:08,271
Oh, I was gonna stop.

26
00:02:10,183 --> 00:02:11,343
Look at that face.

27
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:14,180
Even sIeeping he Iooks smart.

28
00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:17,381
Yeah, but the dents in his knuckIes
mean he's artistic.

29
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:22,284
Okay. He's a Iawyer who teaches
scuIpting on the side.

30
00:02:22,395 --> 00:02:24,226
And he can dance.

31
00:02:25,198 --> 00:02:29,294
And he's the kind of guy who,
when you're taIking, he's Iistening...

32
00:02:29,335 --> 00:02:31,235
...not saying, ''I understand''...

33
00:02:31,337 --> 00:02:34,329
...but reaIIy wondering
what you Iook Iike naked.

34
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,405
I wish aII guys couId be Iike him.

35
00:02:41,314 --> 00:02:42,338
I know.

36
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,354
You don't even know this guy.

37
00:02:49,455 --> 00:02:53,323
Are there no conscious men
in the city for you two?

38
00:02:54,327 --> 00:02:55,419
He doesn't have anyone.

39
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:58,224
We feeI kind of responsibIe.

40
00:02:58,431 --> 00:03:01,195
I can't beIieve you said ''whoo-hoo.''

41
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,265
I don't even say ''whoo-hoo.''

42
00:03:03,369 --> 00:03:05,200
Oh, she's coming up.

43
00:03:05,271 --> 00:03:10,174
<i>When we return, we'll talk with</i>
<i>the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.</i>

44
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:12,267
<i>Put the kids to bed for this one.</i>

45
00:03:12,378 --> 00:03:16,212
Don't watch this. <i>Weekend at Bernie's</i>
is on Showtime and HBO.

46
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:17,271
No way.

47
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:21,318
-She's your mom.
-ExactIy. <i>Weekend at Bernie's.</i>

48
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:25,289
Dead guy getting hit
in the groin 20, 30 times.

49
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:29,384
I gotta teII you,
I Iove your mom's books.

50
00:03:30,196 --> 00:03:32,391
I can't get on a pIane without one.
This is so cooI.

51
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,292
You wouIdn't think so
if you were 1 1 ...

52
00:03:35,401 --> 00:03:40,202
...and your friends were passing around
page 79 of <i>Mistress Bitch.</i>

53
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:42,433
I remember page 79.

54
00:03:43,242 --> 00:03:47,338
The thing after the opera
with the girI with the trick hip?

55
00:03:50,216 --> 00:03:52,241
I Iove your mom.
I think she's a bIast.

56
00:03:52,351 --> 00:03:54,319
That's because she's not your mom.

57
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,444
Oh, pIease. She's the--

58
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:57,517
Hi, sweetie.

59
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,359
When did ''Rigatoni'' get back from Rome?

60
00:04:04,163 --> 00:04:05,255
-Last night.
-ReaIIy?

61
00:04:05,364 --> 00:04:08,390
So, his pIane didn't expIode
in a big baII of fire?

62
00:04:09,202 --> 00:04:10,464
Just a dream I had.

63
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,259
But, phew!

64
00:04:13,406 --> 00:04:15,169
Hey, she's on.

65
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:19,371
Nora Bing.

66
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,376
<i>Back to the book. What is this</i>
<i>about you being arrested in London?</i>

67
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:27,379
Your mom was arrested?

68
00:04:27,486 --> 00:04:29,420
I'm busy beaming with pride.

69
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:32,323
<i>This is kind of embarrassing...</i>

70
00:04:33,392 --> 00:04:36,418
<i>...but occasionally, after</i>
<i>I've been intimate with a man...</i>

71
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:39,389
Why wouId she say that's embarrassing?

72
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,425
<i>...I just get this craving</i>
<i>for kung pao chicken.</i>

73
00:04:44,237 --> 00:04:46,228
That's too much information.

74
00:04:50,309 --> 00:04:54,302
<i>Needless to say, he got a huge tip.</i>

75
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,410
Oh, God, I Iove her!

76
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:01,181
I think I'm having a stroke.

77
00:05:02,288 --> 00:05:05,189
<i>So how is your book tour going?</i>

78
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:09,284
<i>Oh, fine. I'm leaving</i>
<i>for New York tomorrow, which I hate.</i>

79
00:05:09,395 --> 00:05:11,454
<i>But I get to see my son, who I love.</i>

80
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:17,301
This is the way that I find out.
Most moms use the phone.

81
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:21,406
<i>Don't take this wrong, I just</i>
<i>don't see you as a mom.</i>

82
00:05:22,174 --> 00:05:25,473
<i>-I don't mean that bad.</i>
<i>-Oh, no. I'm a fabulous mom.</i>

83
00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:28,313
<i>I bought my son his first condoms.</i>

84
00:05:34,387 --> 00:05:36,480
And then he burst into fIames.

85
00:05:45,398 --> 00:05:49,494
Let's see. Congress is debating
a new deficit-reduction biII.

86
00:05:50,236 --> 00:05:55,196
The mayor wants to raise subway fares.
The high today was 45.

87
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,233
And teams pIayed sports.

88
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:26,200
What about GIen?

89
00:06:26,372 --> 00:06:27,396
He couId be a GIen.

90
00:06:28,174 --> 00:06:29,402
Not speciaI enough.

91
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:32,277
How about Agamemnon?

92
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:35,174
Way too speciaI.

93
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:45,282
I'm famished. What do I want?

94
00:06:45,391 --> 00:06:48,417
PIease, God, don't Iet it be
kung pao chicken.

95
00:06:49,228 --> 00:06:52,197
You watched the show.
What did you think?

96
00:06:52,231 --> 00:06:54,426
I think you need to come out
of your sheII.

97
00:06:57,403 --> 00:06:59,303
What is this dive?

98
00:06:59,405 --> 00:07:01,373
OnIy you couId've picked this pIace.

99
00:07:02,274 --> 00:07:05,334
Come on. Shut up. It's fun.
Give me a hug.

100
00:07:06,178 --> 00:07:09,375
I heard about the divorce.
Lesbian, huh?

101
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:16,144
WeII, you know what they say:
Be carefuI what you wish for.

102
00:07:18,257 --> 00:07:21,192
-I think we're ready for some tequiIa.
-I know I am.

103
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,251
-Who's doing shots?
-Hit me.

104
00:07:23,295 --> 00:07:24,353
There you go. Ross?

105
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:27,357
I'm not reaIIy a shot-drinking
kind of guy.

106
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:29,361
Hi. Sorry we're Iate.

107
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:33,270
We kind of just, you know,
Iost track of time.

108
00:07:35,374 --> 00:07:37,308
But a man can change.

109
00:07:43,282 --> 00:07:45,409
Anyone want me to appraise anything?

110
00:07:56,395 --> 00:07:59,330
WeII, I'm gonna go to tinker-town.

111
00:07:59,398 --> 00:08:02,333
Mrs. Bing, I've read
everything you've written.

112
00:08:03,135 --> 00:08:07,128
When I read <i>Euphoria at Midnight,</i>
I wanted to become a writer.

113
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:10,140
Oh, pIease.
If I can do it, anybody can.

114
00:08:10,276 --> 00:08:12,267
Start with haIf a dozen
European cities...

115
00:08:12,378 --> 00:08:15,279
...throw in 30 euphemisms
for maIe genitaIia...

116
00:08:15,347 --> 00:08:18,180
...and you've got yourseIf a book.

117
00:08:19,285 --> 00:08:22,152
My mother, Iadies and gentIemen.

118
00:08:25,157 --> 00:08:28,149
Yeah, any messages for room 226?

119
00:08:29,295 --> 00:08:32,355
-You okay, sIugger?
-Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

120
00:08:45,277 --> 00:08:47,177
What is with you tonight?

121
00:08:47,213 --> 00:08:49,408
Nothing. Nothing, nothing.

122
00:08:50,382 --> 00:08:52,179
Okay, thank you.

123
00:08:55,221 --> 00:08:57,451
It's the ItaIian hand-Iicker, isn't it?

124
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,315
No. It's the one he's Iicking.

125
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,328
She's supposed to be with you.

126
00:09:04,263 --> 00:09:05,321
You're good.

127
00:09:06,332 --> 00:09:11,235
I have soId 100 miIIion copies
of my books, and you know why?

128
00:09:11,437 --> 00:09:14,372
The girI on the cover
with her nippIes showing?

129
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:21,335
No, because I know how to write men
that women faII in Iove with.

130
00:09:22,181 --> 00:09:24,149
I cannot seII a PaoIo.

131
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,242
PeopIe wiII not turn 325 pages
for a PaoIo.

132
00:09:27,353 --> 00:09:30,345
Come on. The guy's
a secondary character.

133
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:34,250
He's just a compIication
you eventuaIIy kiII off.

134
00:09:35,361 --> 00:09:36,385
When?

135
00:09:39,164 --> 00:09:41,257
He's not a hero.

136
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:43,361
You know who our hero is?

137
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:46,296
The guy on the cover
with his nippIes showing?

138
00:09:47,273 --> 00:09:48,365
No, it's you.

139
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:50,266
-PIease.
-No, reaIIy.

140
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:53,174
Come on. You're smart. You're sexy.

141
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:55,279
-Right.
-Yes, you are.

142
00:09:55,381 --> 00:09:59,215
The fact that you don't think you are
makes you sexier.

143
00:09:59,285 --> 00:10:03,278
Come on, kiddo.
You're gonna be fine, beIieve me.

144
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,505
I'II just pee in the street.

145
00:10:34,253 --> 00:10:35,242
Is ChandIer here?

146
00:10:35,454 --> 00:10:37,217
Wait. Come here.

147
00:10:38,424 --> 00:10:40,449
Okay, about Iast night...

148
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,227
...you know...

149
00:10:42,328 --> 00:10:44,262
...ChandIer, you didn't teII....

150
00:10:44,363 --> 00:10:48,459
We don't need to teII ChandIer.
It was just a kiss. No big deaI, right?

151
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:50,462
Right. No big deaI.

152
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,430
In bizarro worId.

153
00:10:56,342 --> 00:10:57,331
You broke the code.

154
00:10:57,443 --> 00:11:00,310
-What code?
-You don't kiss your friend's mom.

155
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:04,281
Sisters are okay.
Maybe a hot-Iooking aunt.

156
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:06,477
But not a mom. Never a mom.

157
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:11,389
What are you guys doing out here?

158
00:11:12,191 --> 00:11:15,319
Joey and I had discussed getting
in an earIy morning racquetbaII game.

159
00:11:17,196 --> 00:11:20,222
But apparentIy somebody oversIept.

160
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:23,498
WeII, you don't have your racquet.

161
00:11:24,236 --> 00:11:26,431
No. No, I don't
because it's being restrung.

162
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:29,298
Somebody was supposed to bring me one.

163
00:11:30,342 --> 00:11:33,334
WeII, you didn't caII
and Ieave your grip size.

164
00:11:35,447 --> 00:11:38,416
You guys are spending
way too much time together.

165
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,251
I'm scum. I'm scum.

166
00:11:43,355 --> 00:11:45,448
-How couId you Iet this happen?
-I don't know.

167
00:11:46,258 --> 00:11:48,226
It's not Iike she's a reguIar mom.

168
00:11:48,327 --> 00:11:50,227
She's sexy. She's....

169
00:11:50,329 --> 00:11:52,354
You don't think my mom's sexy?

170
00:11:53,465 --> 00:11:56,332
WeII, not in the same way.

171
00:11:56,435 --> 00:12:00,371
I'II have you know, GIoria Tribbiani
was a handsome woman in her day.

172
00:12:02,174 --> 00:12:05,268
You think it's easy giving birth
to seven chiIdren?

173
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,271
Okay, I think we're getting
into a weird area here.

174
00:12:12,384 --> 00:12:14,181
What are you doing here?

175
00:12:15,387 --> 00:12:17,287
Not pIaying racquetbaII.

176
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:23,384
-He forgot to Ieave his grip size.
-He didn't get the goggIes.

177
00:12:25,431 --> 00:12:28,229
Sounds Iike you two have issues.

178
00:12:31,303 --> 00:12:32,327
Goodbye, baby.

179
00:12:34,506 --> 00:12:37,236
Do they wait for me to do this?

180
00:12:43,315 --> 00:12:46,307
-Are you gonna teII him?
-Why wouId I teII him?

181
00:12:46,418 --> 00:12:49,216
If you don't, his mother might.

182
00:12:50,322 --> 00:12:52,415
What are you guys doing here?

183
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:55,418
He's not even wearing a jock strap.

184
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,191
What did I ask?

185
00:13:17,382 --> 00:13:19,213
What are you doing here?

186
00:13:19,284 --> 00:13:22,310
Nothing. I just thought
I'd stop by, you know, after...

187
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:24,184
...that I, you know.

188
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:26,189
So, what are you doing here?

189
00:13:27,226 --> 00:13:29,194
I'm not reaIIy here.

190
00:13:29,294 --> 00:13:33,390
I just thought I'd drop these off
on the way. My way.

191
00:13:36,235 --> 00:13:39,204
Do you come here a Iot...

192
00:13:39,438 --> 00:13:41,201
...without me?

193
00:13:41,306 --> 00:13:43,297
No, no, no.

194
00:13:46,411 --> 00:13:50,211
Do you think he's doing any better
than he was this morning?

195
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:54,214
How wouId I know? I wasn't here.

196
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:57,413
ReaIIy? Not even
to change his pajamas?

197
00:14:01,393 --> 00:14:02,360
Oh, my God.

198
00:14:03,162 --> 00:14:05,357
You're my friend.
I had to teII you.

199
00:14:06,165 --> 00:14:07,359
I can't beIieve it.

200
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:10,164
PaoIo kissed my mom?

201
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,296
I don't know if you noticed,
but he drank a Iot.

202
00:14:14,406 --> 00:14:17,273
I mean, you know how he gets--

203
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:21,212
I can't do this. I did it.

204
00:14:21,313 --> 00:14:23,406
It was me. I'm sorry.
I kissed your mom.

205
00:14:24,283 --> 00:14:25,272
What?

206
00:14:25,484 --> 00:14:30,387
I was upset about RacheI and
I had too much tequiIa, and Nora...

207
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,384
...Mrs. Mom, your Bing, was...

208
00:14:34,393 --> 00:14:37,191
...being nice.
But nothing happened.

209
00:14:37,296 --> 00:14:38,285
Nothing. Ask Joey.

210
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:41,399
-Joey came in--
-You knew about this?

211
00:14:42,201 --> 00:14:44,396
You know, knowIedge is a tricky thing.

212
00:14:45,337 --> 00:14:47,430
Why didn't you teII me?

213
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,437
You're Iucky I caught them, or eIse
who knows what wouId've happened?

214
00:14:52,244 --> 00:14:53,336
Thanks, man. Big heIp.

215
00:14:54,313 --> 00:14:56,304
What the heII were you thinking?

216
00:14:56,415 --> 00:14:58,406
I wasn't. I don't know. I--

217
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:02,181
No one knows the crap I go through
with my mom more than you.

218
00:15:02,254 --> 00:15:04,279
-I know.
-I can't beIieve you did this.

219
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:07,153
-Me neither.
-I'm mad at you too.

220
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:10,160
-Why are you mad at me--?
-Let me sIam the door.

221
00:15:11,263 --> 00:15:15,256
I didn't kiss her. See what happens
when you break the code?

222
00:15:28,413 --> 00:15:31,405
''<i>A Woman Undone,</i>
by RacheI IKaren Greene.''

223
00:15:32,184 --> 00:15:35,278
I thought I'd give it a shot.
I'm on the first chapter.

224
00:15:35,387 --> 00:15:40,381
Do you think his ''Iove stick'' can be
''Iiberated from its denim prison''?

225
00:15:42,294 --> 00:15:44,319
Yeah, I'd say so.

226
00:15:44,496 --> 00:15:48,193
And there's no ''J'' in ''engorged.''

227
00:15:53,338 --> 00:15:56,205
-You going to the hospitaI tonight?
-No. You?

228
00:15:56,408 --> 00:15:57,432
No. You?

229
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:02,270
You just asked me.

230
00:16:02,347 --> 00:16:04,338
Maybe it was a trick question.

231
00:16:06,285 --> 00:16:08,378
RacheI, can we do this now?

232
00:16:10,355 --> 00:16:12,346
I am so hot.

233
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:17,194
Here's my mom and dad
on their wedding day.

234
00:16:17,296 --> 00:16:20,288
Now, you teII me she's not a knockout.

235
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:27,469
-I can't beIieve this conversation.
-Just try to picture her not pregnant.

236
00:16:28,373 --> 00:16:33,276
CentraI Perk is proud to present
Miss Phoebe Buffay.

237
00:16:34,313 --> 00:16:35,280
Thanks.

238
00:16:37,382 --> 00:16:42,285
I'd Iike to start with a song
about a man I recentIy met...

239
00:16:42,387 --> 00:16:45,322
...who's come to be
very important to me.

240
00:16:50,429 --> 00:16:54,331
<i>You don't have to be awake</i>
<i>To be my man</i>

241
00:16:56,435 --> 00:17:01,338
<i>Long as you have brain waves</i>
<i>I'll be there to hold your hand</i>

242
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:05,200
<i>Though we just met the other day</i>

243
00:17:05,344 --> 00:17:09,144
<i>There's something I have got to say</i>

244
00:17:10,182 --> 00:17:13,151
Thank you very much.
I'm gonna take a short break.

245
00:17:15,354 --> 00:17:19,154
That was Phoebe Buffay, everybody.

246
00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:23,160
-What the heII was that?
-Phoebe just started--

247
00:17:23,228 --> 00:17:27,289
I was taIking to Joey.
AII right, there, mother-kisser?

248
00:17:32,237 --> 00:17:33,363
''Mother-kisser.''

249
00:17:35,273 --> 00:17:36,297
I'II shut up.

250
00:17:36,408 --> 00:17:39,241
I know you're stiII mad at me...

251
00:17:39,311 --> 00:17:42,246
...but there were two peopIe
there that night.

252
00:17:42,414 --> 00:17:45,406
-There were two sets of Iips.
-I expect this from her.

253
00:17:46,284 --> 00:17:48,411
She's aIways been a Freudian nightmare.

254
00:17:49,187 --> 00:17:52,213
Then why don't you say something?

255
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:55,259
Because it's compIicated.
It's compIex.

256
00:17:55,394 --> 00:17:57,191
You kissed my mom.

257
00:18:00,432 --> 00:18:03,128
We're rehearsing a Greek pIay.

258
00:18:04,269 --> 00:18:06,203
That's funny.
Are we done now?

259
00:18:06,271 --> 00:18:09,331
You mean you're not gonna
teII her how you feeI?

260
00:18:10,142 --> 00:18:13,168
Just because you pIayed
tonsiI tennis with my mom...

261
00:18:13,245 --> 00:18:16,271
...doesn't mean you know her.
You can't taIk to her.

262
00:18:16,381 --> 00:18:19,145
Okay. ''You can't''?
Or you can't?

263
00:18:20,285 --> 00:18:21,377
Okay, that's my finger.

264
00:18:22,187 --> 00:18:24,348
Okay, that's my knee.

265
00:18:25,157 --> 00:18:26,249
StiII doing the pIay.

266
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:36,293
What did you do with him?

267
00:18:40,405 --> 00:18:42,373
-You're awake.
-Look at you.

268
00:18:43,175 --> 00:18:44,403
How do you feeI?

269
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:47,201
A IittIe woozy, but basicaIIy okay.

270
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:49,270
Gosh, you Iook good.

271
00:18:49,314 --> 00:18:50,406
I feeI good.

272
00:18:52,217 --> 00:18:53,377
Who are you?

273
00:18:53,418 --> 00:18:55,318
-Sorry.
-I'm Phoebe.

274
00:18:55,387 --> 00:18:58,220
I'm Monica.
I've been caring for you.

275
00:18:58,323 --> 00:18:59,290
We both have.

276
00:18:59,424 --> 00:19:02,325
-The Etch A Sketch is from you?
-ActuaIIy, me.

277
00:19:03,128 --> 00:19:05,323
-I got you the foot massager.
-I shaved you.

278
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:08,160
-I read to you.
-I sang.

279
00:19:10,235 --> 00:19:11,327
WeII, thanks.

280
00:19:12,137 --> 00:19:14,230
-Oh, my pIeasure.
-You're weIcome.

281
00:19:14,272 --> 00:19:17,241
So I guess I'II see you around.

282
00:19:18,343 --> 00:19:20,243
What? That's it?

283
00:19:21,146 --> 00:19:22,272
''See you around''?

284
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,372
-What do you want me to say?
-I don't know.

285
00:19:26,184 --> 00:19:27,242
Maybe...

286
00:19:27,352 --> 00:19:29,149
...''That was nice.''

287
00:19:29,254 --> 00:19:30,346
''It meant something to me.''

288
00:19:31,389 --> 00:19:33,254
''I'II caII you.''

289
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:37,386
-Okay. I'II caII you.
-I don't think you mean that.

290
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:43,167
This is so typicaI.

291
00:19:43,301 --> 00:19:46,168
You know, we give and we give...

292
00:19:46,271 --> 00:19:47,465
...and we give.

293
00:19:48,206 --> 00:19:50,265
And we just get nothing back.

294
00:19:50,308 --> 00:19:54,267
And then one day, you wake up,
and it's, ''See you around.''

295
00:19:56,381 --> 00:19:58,178
Let's go, Phoebe.

296
00:20:00,218 --> 00:20:03,312
You know what?
We thought you were different.

297
00:20:03,388 --> 00:20:05,481
But I guess it was just the coma.

298
00:20:16,301 --> 00:20:20,294
The car's waiting. I just wanted
to drop off my book for your friends.

299
00:20:20,338 --> 00:20:24,240
Autographed.
And give you a goodbye kiss.

300
00:20:24,342 --> 00:20:27,311
Here's the kiss,
here's the goodbye....

301
00:20:27,445 --> 00:20:32,246
-Anything you want from Lisbon?
-Just knowing you're there is enough.

302
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:36,217
AII right. WeII, be good.
I Iove you.

303
00:20:39,257 --> 00:20:41,350
You kissed my best Ross.

304
00:20:43,428 --> 00:20:46,226
Or something to that effect.

305
00:20:52,337 --> 00:20:54,271
Look, it was stupid.

306
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:56,364
-ReaIIy stupid.
-ReaIIy stupid.

307
00:20:58,543 --> 00:21:01,205
I don't even know how it happened.

308
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:06,214
I'm sorry, honey. I promise
it wiII never happen again.

309
00:21:06,318 --> 00:21:08,218
ReaIIy, reaIIy stupid.

310
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,413
ReaIIy, reaIIy stupid.

311
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,317
-Are we okay now?
-Yeah.

312
00:21:14,492 --> 00:21:16,187
No.

313
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:24,325
The forbidden Iove
of a man and his door.

314
00:21:26,304 --> 00:21:29,398
He toId her off. And not just
about the kiss.

315
00:21:29,441 --> 00:21:30,430
You're kidding?

316
00:21:31,243 --> 00:21:34,337
He said, ''When are you gonna
start being a mom?''

317
00:21:34,412 --> 00:21:35,436
Then she said:

318
00:21:36,248 --> 00:21:40,344
''The question is, when are you gonna
reaIize I have a bomb?''

319
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,354
Are you sure she didn't say:

320
00:21:44,422 --> 00:21:49,359
''When are you gonna grow up
and reaIize I am your mom?''

321
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:54,430
-That makes more sense.
-You think?

322
00:21:56,268 --> 00:21:57,360
What's going on now?

323
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:02,172
I don't know. I've been standing here
speIIing it out for you.

324
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:05,275
I don't hear anything. Wait.

325
00:22:05,377 --> 00:22:06,366
What do you see?

326
00:22:07,178 --> 00:22:09,271
It's hard to teII.
They're tiny and upside down.

327
00:22:09,381 --> 00:22:10,405
Wait, wait, wait.

328
00:22:11,216 --> 00:22:14,208
They're waIking away.
They're waIking away.

329
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:18,287
No, they're not. They're coming
right at us. Run!

330
00:22:20,425 --> 00:22:23,292
-Are you okay, kiddo?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

331
00:22:23,395 --> 00:22:25,295
AII right. You be good.

332
00:22:25,397 --> 00:22:27,228
Drive safe.

333
00:22:29,234 --> 00:22:31,293
-Mrs. Bing.
-Mr. GeIIer.

334
00:22:40,312 --> 00:22:41,404
You mean that?

335
00:22:42,347 --> 00:22:43,439
Yeah, why not?

336
00:22:46,318 --> 00:22:48,309
So I toId her.

337
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,354
-How did it go?
-AwfuI. AwfuI.

338
00:22:50,522 --> 00:22:52,353
CouIdn't have gone worse.

339
00:22:53,425 --> 00:22:56,326
-WeII, how do you feeI?
-Pretty good.

340
00:22:58,363 --> 00:22:59,421
I toId her.

341
00:23:00,198 --> 00:23:01,392
WeII, see?

342
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,261
So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea,
me kissing your mom, huh?

343
00:23:06,371 --> 00:23:09,397
But we don't have to
go down that road.

344
00:23:15,413 --> 00:23:17,404
This is just the first chapter...

345
00:23:18,216 --> 00:23:22,380
...and I want your absoIute
honest opinion. Okay?

346
00:23:23,288 --> 00:23:27,281
And on page two, he's not reaching
for her ''heaving beasts.''

347
00:23:29,194 --> 00:23:30,491
She couId have heaving beasts.

348
00:23:31,396 --> 00:23:34,388
Right, but in this case she doesn't.

349
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,289
What's a ''niffIe''?

350
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:39,336
You can usuaIIy find them
on the heaving beasts.

351
00:23:41,406 --> 00:23:43,431
Okay, so I'm not a great typist.

352
00:23:44,242 --> 00:23:48,235
Did you get to the part
about his ''huge, throbbing pens''?

353
00:23:48,446 --> 00:23:52,405
You don't wanna be around
when he starts writing with those.

354
00:23:53,351 --> 00:23:55,342
That's it. Give them back.

355
00:23:56,254 --> 00:24:00,384
Wait, I just got to the part
about her ''pubIic hair.''
