1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,384
AII right, no peeking.

2
00:00:04,192 --> 00:00:06,422
No peeking. No peeking. No peeking!

3
00:00:07,195 --> 00:00:11,325
AII right, but you better be
wearing cIothes when I open my eyes.

4
00:00:13,335 --> 00:00:15,303
AII right. Open your eyes.

5
00:00:20,308 --> 00:00:23,436
Sweet mother of aII
that is good and pure!

6
00:00:24,412 --> 00:00:29,247
-<i>Days of our Lives</i> picked up my option!
-CongratuIations!

7
00:00:29,451 --> 00:00:34,252
Now we can watch <i>Green Acres</i>
the way it was meant to be seen.

8
00:00:36,224 --> 00:00:37,350
So which one is mine?

9
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:41,327
Whichever one you want, man.
Whichever one you want!

10
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,364
Not that one.

11
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:50,429
Oh, yes!

12
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,265
Oh, yeah! That's the stuff.

13
00:00:56,444 --> 00:00:58,344
Do we dare?

14
00:00:58,446 --> 00:01:00,209
We dare.

15
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,411
The One Where Ross and RacheI...You Know

16
00:01:53,334 --> 00:01:57,327
I can't beIieve two cows made a
sacrifice so you guys couId...

17
00:01:57,372 --> 00:02:01,365
-...watch TV with your feet up.
-They were chair-shaped cows.

18
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:04,378
They never wouId have survived
in the wiId.

19
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,276
This screen is amazing.
Dick Van Dyke is practicaIIy Iife-size.

20
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:15,219
Rose Marie reaIIy beIongs
on a smaIIer screen.

21
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,424
Hi, you guys.

22
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:21,294
-Hey, you.
-Hey, you.

23
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:30,432
-How was your day?
-You know, pretty much the usuaI.

24
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:34,231
-Sun shining, birds chirping.
-ReaIIy? Mine too.

25
00:02:34,342 --> 00:02:36,435
Hey, cooI. Mine too.

26
00:02:39,414 --> 00:02:42,212
I gotta get to the museum.

27
00:02:42,417 --> 00:02:45,409
-I'II see you tonight?
-Okay.

28
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:52,348
Bye, guys!

29
00:02:55,263 --> 00:02:56,423
Tonight?

30
00:02:59,267 --> 00:03:03,397
-What's tonight?
-Our first officiaI date. First date.

31
00:03:05,273 --> 00:03:06,365
HeIIo?

32
00:03:07,308 --> 00:03:09,173
Hi.

33
00:03:10,278 --> 00:03:13,270
You're waitressing
at my catering thing.

34
00:03:13,314 --> 00:03:17,273
-Any of those words trigger anything?
-Monica, I forgot.

35
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:18,410
It's our first date.

36
00:03:19,187 --> 00:03:22,179
-My mom got me this job.
-I can be a waitress!

37
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,384
Thank you, thank you.
See? Phoebe! Phoebe!

38
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:29,429
You'd have to be an actuaI waitress.
It can't be Iike your...

39
00:03:30,231 --> 00:03:32,199
...''I can be a bear cub'' thing.

40
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,427
I can be a waitress. Watch this.

41
00:03:35,203 --> 00:03:37,398
Give me two number ones, 86 the bacon.

42
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:40,436
One Adam and Eve on a raft
and wreck them!

43
00:03:54,422 --> 00:03:56,356
It's James Bond.

44
00:03:58,226 --> 00:04:01,252
-Sorry we're Iate.
-That's okay. Come on in.

45
00:04:01,296 --> 00:04:04,288
Is Monica GeIIer coming?
I was toId she was.

46
00:04:04,365 --> 00:04:06,196
Dr. Burke, it's me.

47
00:04:06,367 --> 00:04:07,391
Monica?

48
00:04:08,203 --> 00:04:10,296
My God! You used to be so....

49
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:13,363
I mean, you've--
You must have Iost Iike....

50
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:17,403
You Iook great.

51
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:21,473
Thank you. This is Phoebe.
She'II be heIping me.

52
00:04:22,217 --> 00:04:24,185
Nice to meet you.

53
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:30,419
-How you been?
-Great. How have you been?

54
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:35,388
You know Barbara and I spIit
or you wouIdn't do the head tiIt.

55
00:04:35,496 --> 00:04:37,225
The head tiIt?

56
00:04:37,298 --> 00:04:38,390
Since the divorce...

57
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:44,235
...everybody asks how I am with a
sympathetic head tiIt. ''How you doing?''

58
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:45,499
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:48,334
It's fine.
BeIieve me, I do it too.

60
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:52,436
I aIways answer with the
''I'm okay'' head bob. ''I'm okay.''

61
00:04:53,314 --> 00:04:56,249
''You're sure?''
''Yeah, I'm fine.''

62
00:04:56,317 --> 00:04:59,411
I gotta set up the music.
I got a new CD changer.

63
00:04:59,454 --> 00:05:03,185
The divorce onIy Ieft
me with four CDs to change.

64
00:05:03,258 --> 00:05:04,384
That's too bad.

65
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,192
I'II survive.

66
00:05:10,365 --> 00:05:14,267
Two Iarges, extra cheese on both.

67
00:05:14,302 --> 00:05:16,167
But Iisten...

68
00:05:16,204 --> 00:05:18,399
...don't ring the buzzer for 1 9.

69
00:05:19,207 --> 00:05:21,368
Ring 20. GeIIer/Greene.

70
00:05:22,176 --> 00:05:25,168
They'II Iet you in, okay?

71
00:05:27,181 --> 00:05:30,275
If you buzz our door,
there's no tip for you.

72
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:33,187
Okay, thanks.

73
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:38,382
Pizza's on the way.
I toId you we wouIdn't have to get up.

74
00:05:39,294 --> 00:05:41,319
What if we have to pee?

75
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:47,199
I'II canceI the sodas.

76
00:05:50,438 --> 00:05:52,497
Get out there.
It's your party!

77
00:05:53,241 --> 00:05:56,210
They're so duII!
They're aII ophthaImoIogists.

78
00:05:56,444 --> 00:06:00,346
-You're an ophthaImoIogist.
-That's what my parents wanted.

79
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:03,145
I wanted to be a sheriff.

80
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:06,445
That's funny. CadiIIac, cataract.
I get it.

81
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:09,281
No! You stay out there!

82
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:11,385
-You see?
-I teII you what.

83
00:06:12,193 --> 00:06:17,153
I'II come get you in five minutes
with some sort of kebab emergency.

84
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:21,392
Better. Oh, God, here we go.

85
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,398
Want to see them go nuts?

86
00:06:24,272 --> 00:06:26,206
Watch this.

87
00:06:26,374 --> 00:06:29,172
Who needs gIasses?

88
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:38,317
-You are so smitten.
-I am not!

89
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:42,484
Oh, you are so much
the smitten kitten.

90
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:45,291
-Ask him out.
-Dr. Burke?

91
00:06:46,194 --> 00:06:50,221
I don't think so.
I mean, Iike, he's a grownup.

92
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,293
So? You two are totaIIy
into each other.

93
00:06:54,402 --> 00:06:58,202
He's a famiIy friend.
He's 20 years oIder than me.

94
00:06:58,306 --> 00:07:01,139
So you're never gonna see him again?

95
00:07:01,242 --> 00:07:02,334
Not never.

96
00:07:03,277 --> 00:07:06,371
I'm gonna see him tomorrow
at my eye appointment.

97
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:11,240
-Didn't you just get your eyes checked?
-Yeah, but you know...

98
00:07:11,352 --> 00:07:13,252
...27 is...

99
00:07:13,354 --> 00:07:15,345
...a dangerous eye age.

100
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:22,160
They're picking teams to pIay
''Guess my prescription.'' HeIp me!

101
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:30,363
I'm not saying it was a bad movie.
I'm saying it was a IittIe...

102
00:07:31,172 --> 00:07:32,161
...hard to foIIow.

103
00:07:32,373 --> 00:07:36,400
-I toId you there wouId be subtitIes.
-I know.

104
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:41,372
I just didn't want to wear
my gIasses on our first date.

105
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,282
Monica?

106
00:07:54,195 --> 00:07:58,393
It wouId heIp when I'm kissing you
if you didn't shout my sister's name.

107
00:07:58,433 --> 00:08:00,230
I'm just checking.

108
00:08:01,335 --> 00:08:04,133
-Monica?
-Mon?

109
00:08:34,402 --> 00:08:36,267
What?

110
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,167
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:38,272 --> 00:08:41,264
When you moved your hands
down to my butt...

112
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:45,177
...it was, Iike,
''Whoa! Ross's hands are on my butt!''

113
00:08:46,414 --> 00:08:49,178
And that's funny. Why?

114
00:08:50,318 --> 00:08:52,286
WeII, it's not.

115
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,379
Sorry. I'm just nervous.

116
00:08:54,422 --> 00:08:58,324
I mean, it's you. You know, it's us.

117
00:08:58,426 --> 00:09:02,260
We're crossing that Iine.
It's sort of a big thing.

118
00:09:02,363 --> 00:09:07,232
WeII, I know it's big.
I just didn't know it was ha-ha big.

119
00:09:18,346 --> 00:09:21,338
Okay, my hands were
nowhere near your butt.

120
00:09:21,382 --> 00:09:23,179
I know! I know!

121
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:26,379
I was thinking about
the Iast time they were there.

122
00:09:27,154 --> 00:09:29,247
I'm sorry. Look! I promise.

123
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,282
I won't Iaugh anymore.
Put your hands back.

124
00:09:32,393 --> 00:09:35,260
No, see, now I can't.

125
00:09:36,297 --> 00:09:40,256
-I'm feeIing too seIf-conscious.
-Touch my butt.

126
00:09:41,202 --> 00:09:44,296
-Just one cheek.
-The moment's gone.

127
00:09:44,405 --> 00:09:47,397
-I'II back up into your hands.
-That's romantic.

128
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:49,198
<i>-Touch it.</i>
<i>-No.</i>

129
00:09:49,277 --> 00:09:51,177
<i>-Come on, squeeze it.</i>
<i>-No!</i>

130
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,268
<i>-Rub it?</i>
<i>-No.</i>

131
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,315
<i>Oh, come on!</i>
<i>Would you just grab my ass?</i>

132
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,384
Wow! Look at that!
The car is on fire...

133
00:10:06,193 --> 00:10:09,185
...yet somehow
its expensive paint job...

134
00:10:09,297 --> 00:10:12,425
...is protected by the MiracIe Wax.

135
00:10:14,402 --> 00:10:17,303
You got a Chee-to on your face, man.

136
00:10:28,249 --> 00:10:31,309
Aren't you supposed
to be out with RacheI?

137
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:33,410
That was 1 4 hours ago.

138
00:10:35,456 --> 00:10:38,323
We gotta set the cIock on this.

139
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,328
So how'd it go?

140
00:10:42,363 --> 00:10:46,322
Have you ever been, you know,
fooIing around with a girI...

141
00:10:47,268 --> 00:10:49,327
...and she started Iaughing?

142
00:10:49,537 --> 00:10:51,266
Yeah.

143
00:10:51,372 --> 00:10:57,277
But it was 1 982 and my FIock of
SeaguIIs haircut tickIed her chin.

144
00:11:00,214 --> 00:11:01,374
She Iaughed at you?

145
00:11:01,415 --> 00:11:04,213
It couId have been worse.

146
00:11:04,285 --> 00:11:06,276
I couId have been naked.

147
00:11:11,325 --> 00:11:14,192
I've wanted this since 9th grade.

148
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:16,229
I want it to be perfect...

149
00:11:16,297 --> 00:11:20,199
...and right and....

150
00:11:20,434 --> 00:11:24,200
Why isn't that Iaser
cutting through the paint?

151
00:11:24,305 --> 00:11:27,399
-It's the MiracIe Wax!
-It certainIy is a miracIe.

152
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:29,403
-Hi, you guys.
-Hey.

153
00:11:31,345 --> 00:11:33,438
Listen, I was thinking about....

154
00:11:34,248 --> 00:11:35,442
Can you guys speak up?

155
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:39,516
It's harder for us to hear you
when you Iower your voice.

156
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:41,413
-HaIIway?
-Yeah.

157
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,326
I'm sorry about Iast night.
I reaIIy want to make it up to you.

158
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:55,528
There's no need to make it--
How?

159
00:11:57,271 --> 00:12:01,207
WeII, I was thinking maybe
a romantic dinner...

160
00:12:01,308 --> 00:12:04,277
...with candIes and wine.

161
00:12:04,311 --> 00:12:09,374
And then maybe going
back to my pIace for...

162
00:12:10,217 --> 00:12:12,185
...dessert.

163
00:12:13,287 --> 00:12:14,379
That sounds...

164
00:12:14,488 --> 00:12:16,388
...perfect.

165
00:12:24,398 --> 00:12:28,198
-What's this?
-WouId you get us a coupIe of beers?

166
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,207
I'm going to Iook into your eyes now.

167
00:12:36,243 --> 00:12:37,437
ReaIIy?

168
00:12:38,245 --> 00:12:40,236
Yeah, that's my job.

169
00:12:41,215 --> 00:12:43,342
AII right. Look up.

170
00:12:44,418 --> 00:12:45,407
Look down.

171
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,317
No, open your eyes and Iook down.

172
00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:50,245
That's right.

173
00:12:50,324 --> 00:12:52,258
Look into the Iight.

174
00:12:53,327 --> 00:12:55,318
Now Iook at me.

175
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:05,161
Okay!

176
00:13:06,307 --> 00:13:09,276
Your eyes Iook good.
Those are good eyes.

177
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:11,367
Good. They feeI good.

178
00:13:12,213 --> 00:13:13,271
In my head.

179
00:13:19,186 --> 00:13:21,416
-It was great to see you.
-You too.

180
00:13:22,423 --> 00:13:24,323
You too.

181
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:30,229
Goodbye.

182
00:13:31,398 --> 00:13:33,389
-Drops!
-What?

183
00:13:34,235 --> 00:13:35,395
Here, they're free.

184
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:40,339
Thanks.

185
00:13:41,442 --> 00:13:45,208
-I better be going.
-Yeah, I'II see you Iater.

186
00:13:45,312 --> 00:13:47,303
Thanks again.

187
00:14:00,394 --> 00:14:04,296
We have to get you Iazy boys
out of these chairs.

188
00:14:07,268 --> 00:14:11,261
You shouId go out and be with
the three-dimensionaI peopIe.

189
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:14,397
No. Inside good.

190
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:18,209
Outside bad.

191
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:20,404
You guys are so pathetic.

192
00:14:21,182 --> 00:14:22,308
Oh, <i>Xanadu</i>!

193
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,187
She's one of us now.

194
00:14:30,224 --> 00:14:32,317
-Hi, you guys.
-Hey.

195
00:14:33,227 --> 00:14:35,422
We wanted to stop by
and say good night.

196
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,198
Good night.

197
00:14:38,332 --> 00:14:43,429
-They won't even turn their heads.
-AII right. I'm taking off my shirt.

198
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,401
No. She's Iying.

199
00:14:53,214 --> 00:14:57,344
Stop sending food to our apartment!

200
00:14:58,352 --> 00:15:02,254
-Why are you dressed up?
-You're not the onIy one with a date.

201
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:04,382
-You have a date? Who with?
-No one.

202
00:15:05,192 --> 00:15:07,285
-What's his name?
-Nothing.

203
00:15:08,262 --> 00:15:09,286
Come on, teII me.

204
00:15:10,264 --> 00:15:13,165
AII right, but I'm excited about this.

205
00:15:13,267 --> 00:15:16,361
Promise you won't get
big-brothery and judgmentaI.

206
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,402
I promise.

207
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:20,366
-Richard Burke.
-Who's Richard Burke?

208
00:15:20,474 --> 00:15:22,203
Dr. Burke?

209
00:15:23,277 --> 00:15:26,371
You have a date with Dr. Burke?
Why? Why? Why...

210
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,278
...shouId that bother me?

211
00:15:29,316 --> 00:15:31,284
I Iove that man.
He's Iike a...

212
00:15:31,385 --> 00:15:33,216
...a brother to Dad.

213
00:15:36,423 --> 00:15:41,292
-Here we go.
-No, I think it's great that he's 50.

214
00:15:41,428 --> 00:15:46,388
He'II be an inspiration to men who are
aImost retired aII over the worId.

215
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:51,399
He's the brightest, most sophisticated,
sexiest man I've ever been with.

216
00:15:51,438 --> 00:15:53,201
He's sexy?

217
00:15:53,307 --> 00:15:56,333
Oh, God! AbsoIuteIy!

218
00:15:58,212 --> 00:15:59,236
Damn!

219
00:15:59,346 --> 00:16:01,337
It's the museum again.
Can I--?

220
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,277
-Dr. Burke kissed me once.
-When?

221
00:16:05,352 --> 00:16:09,379
When I was 7, I crashed my bike
out in front of his house...

222
00:16:10,157 --> 00:16:13,354
...and to stop me from crying,
he kissed me right here.

223
00:16:14,161 --> 00:16:15,458
-Oh, you are so Iucky!
-I know.

224
00:16:17,197 --> 00:16:20,394
AustraIopithecus isn't supposed
to be in that dispIay.

225
00:16:22,403 --> 00:16:27,272
No, Homo habiIis was erect.
AustraIopithecus was never fuIIy erect.

226
00:16:27,374 --> 00:16:29,365
WeII, maybe he was nervous.

227
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:39,284
Oh, Iook!
I can't beIieve this!

228
00:16:39,386 --> 00:16:43,379
Homo habiIis can't use tooIs yet,
and he has cIay pots?

229
00:16:44,191 --> 00:16:47,183
Why don't they just
give him a microwave?

230
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:50,286
CIearIy he'd have no pIace
to pIug it in.

231
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,491
Sorry.

232
00:16:56,303 --> 00:17:00,262
I'm sorry this is taking so Iong.
It's Ionger than I expected.

233
00:17:00,374 --> 00:17:02,365
-We wiII have dinner.
-It's fine.

234
00:17:03,177 --> 00:17:05,145
KarI!

235
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,211
Oh, God.

236
00:17:21,195 --> 00:17:23,390
-Wow! Is that MicheIIe?
-Yep.

237
00:17:24,164 --> 00:17:26,359
I've not seen her since graduation.

238
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,166
Oh, my God, that night
she got so dru--

239
00:17:32,272 --> 00:17:33,364
EmotionaI.

240
00:17:34,174 --> 00:17:36,267
You know, she's having another baby.

241
00:17:36,377 --> 00:17:40,370
-I thought she just had one.
-No, no. Henry's aImost 2.

242
00:17:40,414 --> 00:17:44,373
And he's taIking
and everything. Here.

243
00:17:45,185 --> 00:17:48,416
He toId me he Iiked me
better than his other grandpa.

244
00:17:49,189 --> 00:17:53,182
In aII fairness, his other
grandpa's a drunk, but stiII....

245
00:17:55,295 --> 00:17:57,286
You're a grandpa.

246
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:01,361
Yeah.

247
00:18:06,273 --> 00:18:08,264
Are we nuts here?

248
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:10,240
I don't know. Maybe.

249
00:18:10,344 --> 00:18:15,372
I mean, I'm dating a man
whose pooI I once peed in.

250
00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:18,344
I didn't need to know that.

251
00:18:19,253 --> 00:18:22,154
I guess 21 years is a Iot.

252
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:27,149
HeII, I'm a whoIe ''person
who can drink'' oIder than you.

253
00:18:28,262 --> 00:18:30,162
Yeah.

254
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:33,461
So....

255
00:18:36,403 --> 00:18:40,271
-So maybe we shouId just....
-Yeah.

256
00:18:42,376 --> 00:18:44,276
Maybe....

257
00:18:48,182 --> 00:18:49,410
Wow.

258
00:18:51,418 --> 00:18:53,181
This reaIIy sucks.

259
00:18:53,287 --> 00:18:56,188
Yeah, it sure does.

260
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,266
We don't have to decide
anything now, do we?

261
00:19:16,376 --> 00:19:19,436
No, there's no rush or anything.

262
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:24,340
-Pizza deIivery!
-Oh, I'm gonna kiII those guys!

263
00:19:27,187 --> 00:19:28,279
Rach.

264
00:19:28,388 --> 00:19:30,288
I'm done.

265
00:19:30,457 --> 00:19:34,154
Yeah, weII, you know what?
So is Sorrentino's.

266
00:19:34,261 --> 00:19:37,355
I'm sorry.
Why don't we find somepIace eIse?

267
00:19:37,397 --> 00:19:41,265
It's Iate. Everything's cIosed.
We'II do it again.

268
00:19:41,301 --> 00:19:42,393
No, no, we won't.

269
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,262
We won't?

270
00:19:45,205 --> 00:19:46,399
Come on.

271
00:19:47,207 --> 00:19:48,401
Okay, that's dead, right?

272
00:19:51,278 --> 00:19:53,178
What are we doing?

273
00:19:53,213 --> 00:19:56,478
-Do you want Cran-AppIe or Cran-Grape?
-Grape.

274
00:19:59,186 --> 00:20:00,312
Okay, now...

275
00:20:00,387 --> 00:20:02,287
...sit.

276
00:20:06,393 --> 00:20:09,385
Oh, my God!

277
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:13,297
<i>Billions of years ago,</i>
<i>Earth was only--</i>

278
00:20:15,302 --> 00:20:16,291
Sorry.

279
00:20:20,307 --> 00:20:21,331
So...

280
00:20:21,408 --> 00:20:23,308
...what are we Iooking at?

281
00:20:24,344 --> 00:20:28,303
See that IittIe cIuster
of stars next to the big one?

282
00:20:28,348 --> 00:20:31,249
That is Ursa Major.

283
00:20:31,418 --> 00:20:34,444
-ReaIIy?
-I have no idea. CouId be.

284
00:20:37,457 --> 00:20:40,255
I'm sorry I had to work tonight.

285
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,428
Oh, that's okay.

286
00:20:42,462 --> 00:20:45,226
You were worth the wait.

287
00:20:45,465 --> 00:20:48,434
And I don't just mean tonight.

288
00:20:57,444 --> 00:20:59,435
You're not Iaughing.

289
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:02,312
This time it's not so funny.

290
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,293
Loosen the knot.

291
00:21:35,249 --> 00:21:36,511
Oh, God!

292
00:21:37,517 --> 00:21:41,317
Honey? That's okay.

293
00:21:41,455 --> 00:21:43,355
What?

294
00:21:43,457 --> 00:21:46,449
Oh, no. You just roIIed
over the juice box.

295
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:57,328
Thank God!

296
00:22:25,198 --> 00:22:26,392
Hey.

297
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,191
Hey, you.

298
00:22:34,308 --> 00:22:37,300
I can't beIieve I'm waking up
next to you.

299
00:22:37,444 --> 00:22:39,503
I know. It is pretty unbeIieve--

300
00:22:41,415 --> 00:22:44,441
-What?
-We're not aIone.

301
00:23:12,312 --> 00:23:14,371
Is that the fire aIarm?

302
00:23:14,481 --> 00:23:16,210
Yeah.

303
00:23:19,386 --> 00:23:22,321
It's not warm yet.
We stiII have time.

304
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,188
-CooI.
<i>-Yeah, yeah. Cool!</i>
