620
00:48:30,019 --> 00:48:31,008
Coffee.

621
00:48:31,187 --> 00:48:33,212
-Thank you.
-Cappuccino.

622
00:48:35,024 --> 00:48:37,993
And a nice, hot cider for Monica.

623
00:48:38,094 --> 00:48:39,994
Thank you.

624
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:44,032
Rach, why does my cinnamon stick
have an eraser?

625
00:48:48,104 --> 00:48:49,230
That's why.

626
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,037
Sorry.

627
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:56,235
The One With The Stoned Guy

628
00:49:48,998 --> 00:49:50,090
ChandIer?

629
00:49:51,134 --> 00:49:53,193
Miss TedIock, you Iook IoveIy today.

630
00:49:54,003 --> 00:49:57,131
That is a very fIattering
sIeeve Iength on you.

631
00:49:59,142 --> 00:50:03,135
Mr. CostiIick wouId Iike you to stop
by his office today.

632
00:50:04,113 --> 00:50:08,015
If it's about those prank memos,
I wasn't invoIved.

633
00:50:08,117 --> 00:50:10,051
Nothing at aII. ReaIIy.

634
00:50:12,255 --> 00:50:18,125
And frankIy, those shenanigans have
no pIace in an office environment.

635
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:25,327
Hey, you guys!

636
00:50:26,069 --> 00:50:28,264
ChandIer's coming and
he has incredibIe news.

637
00:50:29,072 --> 00:50:32,166
So when he gets here,
Iet's aII act, Iike, you know--

638
00:50:33,076 --> 00:50:36,011
Never mind. But it was gonna
be reaIIy good.

639
00:50:37,013 --> 00:50:38,105
What's going on?

640
00:50:38,214 --> 00:50:41,115
So it's a typicaI day at work...

641
00:50:41,184 --> 00:50:46,178
...and Big AI teIIs me he wants
to make me processing supervisor.

642
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:48,981
-That is great!
-CongratuIations!

643
00:50:49,092 --> 00:50:51,083
So I quit.

644
00:50:51,995 --> 00:50:53,087
Why?

645
00:50:53,129 --> 00:50:55,188
Why? This was a temp job.

646
00:50:55,999 --> 00:50:58,194
ChandIer, you've been there
for five years.

647
00:50:59,002 --> 00:51:03,029
I know, but if I took it, I'd be
admitting that this is what I do.

648
00:51:03,106 --> 00:51:08,100
Does that mean we have to start buying
our own toiIet paper?

649
00:51:08,211 --> 00:51:12,011
That was Joey Tribbiani
with the big picture. Dan?

650
00:51:12,215 --> 00:51:14,012
Was it more money?

651
00:51:14,117 --> 00:51:18,247
Doesn't matter. I just don't want
to be a guy who sits in his office...

652
00:51:19,022 --> 00:51:21,013
...worrying about the WENUS.

653
00:51:23,226 --> 00:51:24,250
The ''WENUS''?

654
00:51:25,128 --> 00:51:28,962
WeekIy estimated net usage system.
It's a processing term.

655
00:51:29,198 --> 00:51:31,166
Oh, that WENUS.

656
00:51:33,069 --> 00:51:34,058
What wiII you do?

657
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:38,971
I don't know. But I won't
figure it out working there.

658
00:51:39,008 --> 00:51:41,067
I have something you can do!

659
00:51:41,177 --> 00:51:44,271
I have this new massage cIient, Steve.

660
00:51:45,114 --> 00:51:48,015
Anyway, he's opening up
a restaurant...

661
00:51:48,084 --> 00:51:50,211
...and he's Iooking for a head chef.

662
00:51:53,189 --> 00:51:56,124
-Hi, there.
-Hi.

663
00:51:56,192 --> 00:52:00,026
I know. You're a chef
and I thought of you first.

664
00:52:00,129 --> 00:52:03,997
But ChandIer's the one
who needs a job right now, so....

665
00:52:05,201 --> 00:52:08,136
I just don't have a Iot
of chef-ing experience.

666
00:52:08,237 --> 00:52:11,229
UnIess it's an aII-toast restaurant.

667
00:52:12,241 --> 00:52:14,209
What is he Iooking for?

668
00:52:15,011 --> 00:52:17,036
He wants to do something ecIectic.

669
00:52:17,113 --> 00:52:21,243
He's Iooking for someone
who can create the entire menu.

670
00:52:22,051 --> 00:52:23,313
So, what do you think?

671
00:52:25,221 --> 00:52:28,247
Thanks. I just don't see myseIf
in a big, white hat.

672
00:52:31,995 --> 00:52:34,156
Oh, Monica! Guess what?

673
00:52:36,966 --> 00:52:40,959
<i>--a perfect run-up</i>
<i>and there he goes, a perfect....</i>

674
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:42,196
Watch stuff Iike this...

675
00:52:43,006 --> 00:52:46,169
...and you reaIize
why evoIution is just a theory.

676
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:55,178
Can you see my nippIes
through this shirt?

677
00:52:55,218 --> 00:53:00,019
No, but don't worry.
I'm sure they're stiII there.

678
00:53:00,089 --> 00:53:01,215
Where are you going?

679
00:53:01,991 --> 00:53:07,987
I have an appointment with Dr. Robert
PiIman, career counseIor-a-go-go!

680
00:53:08,231 --> 00:53:11,223
-I added the ''a-go-go.''
-Career counseIor?

681
00:53:12,035 --> 00:53:15,004
You guys aII know
what you want to do.

682
00:53:15,104 --> 00:53:16,128
I don't.

683
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,237
You guys in the Iiving room
aII know what you want to do.

684
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:24,207
You have goaIs. You have dreams.
I don't have a dream!

685
00:53:25,014 --> 00:53:28,040
The Iesser-known
''I Don't Have a Dream'' speech.

686
00:53:29,986 --> 00:53:32,181
I Iove my Iife! I Iove my Iife!

687
00:53:32,989 --> 00:53:34,183
''Brian's Song''!

688
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,061
-The meeting went great?
-So great!

689
00:53:40,163 --> 00:53:43,155
He showed me
where the restaurant's gonna be.

690
00:53:43,966 --> 00:53:46,992
It's not too big or too smaII.
It's just right.

691
00:53:47,103 --> 00:53:51,096
Was it formerIy owned
by a bIond woman and some bears?

692
00:53:51,174 --> 00:53:54,974
I'm cooking for him Monday,
kind of an audition.

693
00:53:55,078 --> 00:53:59,981
Phoebe, he wants you here.
It's great. You can make yummy noises.

694
00:54:00,016 --> 00:54:03,110
-What are you gonna make?
-Yummy noises.

695
00:54:04,187 --> 00:54:09,124
-And Monica, what are you gonna make?
-I don't know. It's gotta be great.

696
00:54:09,192 --> 00:54:11,217
I know what you can make!
I know!

697
00:54:12,028 --> 00:54:16,021
You shouId make that thing
with the stuff.

698
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:20,135
You know that thing with the stuff?

699
00:54:21,204 --> 00:54:23,195
Okay, I don't know.

700
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,937
Anyone know a good date pIace
in the neighborhood?

701
00:54:27,977 --> 00:54:32,073
How about Tony's? If you finish
a 32-ounce steak, it's free.

702
00:54:36,052 --> 00:54:39,249
Anyone know a good pIace
if you're not dating a puma?

703
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:44,153
-Who are you going out with?
-Is this the bug Iady?

704
00:54:44,961 --> 00:54:47,088
''I Iove you, Ross.''

705
00:54:48,197 --> 00:54:52,998
Her name is CeIia and
she's insect curator at the museum.

706
00:54:54,203 --> 00:54:58,071
-What are you gonna do?
-Go out to dinner...

707
00:54:58,174 --> 00:55:02,975
...then bring her back to my pIace
and introduce her to my monkey.

708
00:55:04,981 --> 00:55:08,007
And he's not speaking metaphoricaIIy.

709
00:55:09,986 --> 00:55:15,185
So back to your pIace?
You thinking maybe....

710
00:55:16,993 --> 00:55:19,188
WeII, I don't know....

711
00:55:19,996 --> 00:55:22,089
I'm hoping....

712
00:55:22,999 --> 00:55:25,092
That monkey is a chick magnet.

713
00:55:25,134 --> 00:55:31,039
She'II take one Iook at his cute,
IittIe face and it'II seaI the deaI.

714
00:55:31,974 --> 00:55:35,967
CeIia, don't worry.
He's not gonna hurt you!

715
00:55:36,045 --> 00:55:38,036
Soothing tones.

716
00:55:38,981 --> 00:55:42,940
-Here, MarceI.
-I can't stand this.

717
00:55:43,052 --> 00:55:46,988
-He's got his cIaws on my--
-Yeah, aII right.

718
00:55:54,063 --> 00:55:56,964
Okay, try this saImon mousse.

719
00:55:58,167 --> 00:55:59,259
Good.

720
00:56:00,002 --> 00:56:02,994
Is it better than
the other saImon mousse?

721
00:56:03,072 --> 00:56:07,008
-It's creamier.
-Yeah? WeII, is that better?

722
00:56:07,076 --> 00:56:11,069
I don't know.
We're taIking about whipped fish.

723
00:56:11,214 --> 00:56:14,081
I'm just happy I'm keeping it down.

724
00:56:19,989 --> 00:56:21,183
God, what happened to you?

725
00:56:21,991 --> 00:56:24,983
Eight and a haIf hours
of aptitude tests...

726
00:56:25,027 --> 00:56:29,054
...inteIIigence tests, personaIity
tests, and what do I Iearn?

727
00:56:29,966 --> 00:56:35,927
''You're suited for data processing for
a Iarge muItinationaI corporation.''

728
00:56:35,972 --> 00:56:39,135
That's so great!
You aIready know how to do that.

729
00:56:39,976 --> 00:56:41,944
Can you beIieve it?

730
00:56:41,978 --> 00:56:45,141
Don't I seem Iike I shouId
be doing something cooI?

731
00:56:45,248 --> 00:56:49,184
I just aIways pictured myseIf
doing something....

732
00:56:49,952 --> 00:56:51,044
Something!

733
00:56:51,153 --> 00:56:54,088
ChandIer, I know, I know.

734
00:56:54,991 --> 00:56:59,052
Hey, you can see your nippIes
through this shirt.

735
00:57:02,098 --> 00:57:04,157
Maybe this wiII cheer you up.

736
00:57:05,167 --> 00:57:10,969
I had a grape about five hours ago,
so I better spIit this with you.

737
00:57:11,073 --> 00:57:14,167
It's supposed to be smaII.
It's a pre-appetizer.

738
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:17,236
The French caII it an <i>amuse-bouche.</i>

739
00:57:20,116 --> 00:57:23,176
WeII, it is amusing.

740
00:57:30,159 --> 00:57:33,151
Hi, Wendy. Yeah, 8:00.

741
00:57:34,163 --> 00:57:37,064
What did we say, $10 an hour?

742
00:57:37,166 --> 00:57:41,034
Okay, great.
AII right, I'II see you then.

743
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:45,166
-$10 an hour for what?
-A waitress from work is heIping me.

744
00:57:46,075 --> 00:57:47,940
Waitressing?

745
00:57:51,047 --> 00:57:55,074
Of course I thought of you.
But....

746
00:57:55,151 --> 00:57:57,142
-But....
-But, but....

747
00:57:59,088 --> 00:58:03,991
But it's just this night
has to go just perfect, you know?

748
00:58:04,093 --> 00:58:08,086
Wendy's more
of a professionaI waitress.

749
00:58:10,266 --> 00:58:16,205
And I'm maintaining my amateur status
so I can waitress in the OIympics.

750
00:58:19,108 --> 00:58:24,102
I don't mean to brag, but
I waited tabIes at Innsbruck in '76.

751
00:58:26,082 --> 00:58:28,107
Took home a bronze.

752
00:58:31,087 --> 00:58:33,078
<i>Amuse-bouche</i>?

753
00:58:50,106 --> 00:58:52,097
TaIk to me.

754
00:58:56,145 --> 00:58:59,205
A weird thing happened
on the train this morning--

755
00:59:00,015 --> 00:59:02,210
TaIk dirty.

756
00:59:06,021 --> 00:59:10,014
-Here?
-Come on. Come on.

757
00:59:10,126 --> 00:59:13,254
Say something hot.

758
00:59:15,064 --> 00:59:18,124
What? What?

759
00:59:23,239 --> 00:59:26,037
VuIva.

760
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,088
VuIva?

761
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:45,217
I panicked, aII right?
She took me by surprise.

762
00:59:46,028 --> 00:59:49,987
But it wasn't a totaI Ioss.
We ended up cuddIing.

763
00:59:50,032 --> 00:59:53,195
You cuddIed? How many times?

764
00:59:54,136 --> 00:59:56,195
Shut up. It was nice.

765
00:59:56,305 --> 00:59:59,297
I don't think
I'm a dirty-taIking kind of guy.

766
01:00:00,042 --> 01:00:04,240
Just say what you wanna do to her.
Or what you want her to do to you.

767
01:00:05,014 --> 01:00:08,108
Or what other peopIe
might be doing to each other.

768
01:00:08,217 --> 01:00:11,243
I'II teII you what.
Try something on me.

769
01:00:14,123 --> 01:00:16,023
PIease be kidding.

770
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:19,218
Why not?

771
01:00:20,029 --> 01:00:25,126
Just cIose your eyes and teII me
what you'd Iike to be doing right now.

772
01:00:31,073 --> 01:00:33,166
I'm in my apartment....

773
01:00:34,076 --> 01:00:36,169
-Yeah, what eIse?
-You're not there.

774
01:00:36,212 --> 01:00:42,208
-We're not having this conversation.
-AII right, I'II start. Ready?

775
01:00:43,118 --> 01:00:45,177
Oh, Ross...

776
01:00:47,089 --> 01:00:51,992
...you get me so hot.
I want your Iips on me now.

777
01:00:56,198 --> 01:00:59,190
-Now you say something.
-I reaIIy don't think so.

778
01:01:00,035 --> 01:01:04,199
You Iike this woman, right?
You wanna see her again, right?

779
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:09,041
If you can't taIk dirty to me,
how wiII you taIk dirty to her?

780
01:01:09,111 --> 01:01:11,306
Now teII me
you wanna caress my butt!

781
01:01:15,217 --> 01:01:18,015
Okay, turn around.

782
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:21,018
I don't want you staring at me.

783
01:01:21,123 --> 01:01:23,250
AII right, I'm not Iooking.
Go ahead.

784
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:25,219
Okay.

785
01:01:28,163 --> 01:01:31,189
I want--
Okay, I want...

786
01:01:32,001 --> 01:01:36,165
...to feeI your hot, soft skin
with my Iips.

787
01:01:36,972 --> 01:01:41,204
There you go.
IKeep going, keep going.

788
01:01:46,015 --> 01:01:49,007
I want to take my tongue and--

789
01:01:58,093 --> 01:01:59,219
Say it.

790
01:02:02,197 --> 01:02:04,188
Say it!

791
01:02:05,034 --> 01:02:08,993
--run it aII over your body...

792
01:02:10,039 --> 01:02:12,200
...untiI you're trembIing with--

793
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:33,151
With?

794
01:02:35,097 --> 01:02:38,999
-Funny story.
-You're not gonna beIieve this.

795
01:02:39,068 --> 01:02:43,095
I was aIways rooting for you
two kids to get together.

796
01:02:45,207 --> 01:02:48,267
-The trembIing thing was nice.
-Shut up!

797
01:02:49,011 --> 01:02:52,003
That guy from your oId job
caIIed again.

798
01:02:52,214 --> 01:02:56,173
-Again?
-And again and again and again.

799
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:03,124
And again.

800
01:03:04,026 --> 01:03:08,087
Hey, Mr. CostiIick.
How's Iife on the 1 5th fIoor?

801
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:10,130
Yeah, I miss you too.

802
01:03:10,199 --> 01:03:15,034
It's a Iot Iess satisfying
to steaI pens from your own home.

803
01:03:16,238 --> 01:03:20,231
That's very generous.
But this isn't about the money.

804
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:25,140
I need more than a job.
I need something I reaIIy care ab--

805
01:03:26,015 --> 01:03:28,245
That's on top of the year-end bonus?

806
01:03:28,984 --> 01:03:30,076
Your dream!

807
01:03:30,185 --> 01:03:33,985
Look, AI, I'm not
pIaying hardbaII here, okay?

808
01:03:34,056 --> 01:03:38,049
This is not a negotiation.
This is a rejection!

809
01:03:39,161 --> 01:03:40,958
Stop saying numbers!

810
01:03:41,063 --> 01:03:44,157
I'm teIIing you,
you've got the wrong guy!

811
01:03:44,967 --> 01:03:47,094
I'II see you Monday!

812
01:04:00,115 --> 01:04:05,280
Wow! It's huge!
It's so much bigger than the cubicIe.

813
01:04:06,088 --> 01:04:08,079
This is a cube!

814
01:04:08,223 --> 01:04:10,214
Look at this.

815
01:04:13,228 --> 01:04:16,220
You have a window!

816
01:04:16,999 --> 01:04:20,025
Yes, indeed-y.
With a beautifuI view of--

817
01:04:20,135 --> 01:04:23,104
Look! That guy's peeing!

818
01:04:24,106 --> 01:04:27,075
That's enough of the view.
Check this out.

819
01:04:27,976 --> 01:04:29,944
Okay, sit down here.

820
01:04:30,045 --> 01:04:32,138
This is great.

821
01:04:32,981 --> 01:04:34,972
-You ready?
-Yeah.

822
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:37,175
HeIen, couId you come in here?

823
01:04:43,092 --> 01:04:45,185
Thank you, HeIen. That'II be aII.

824
01:04:47,096 --> 01:04:50,088
Last time I do that.
I promise.

825
01:04:54,169 --> 01:04:59,106
-She doesn't seem very warm.
-I know. She has no personaIity.

826
01:05:03,212 --> 01:05:06,079
Wendy, don't do this to me.

827
01:05:06,181 --> 01:05:10,982
We had a deaI.
Yeah, you promised.

828
01:05:17,226 --> 01:05:22,129
-Who was that?
-Wendy baiIed.

829
01:05:22,231 --> 01:05:25,132
I have no waitress.

830
01:05:26,101 --> 01:05:30,128
That's too bad.
Bye-bye.

831
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:34,031
Ten doIIars an hour!
TweIve doIIars an hour!

832
01:05:34,176 --> 01:05:39,011
I wish I couId, but I've made pIans
to waIk around.

833
01:05:39,081 --> 01:05:42,141
When you ran out on your wedding,
I was there.

834
01:05:42,184 --> 01:05:46,177
I put a roof over your head!
If that means nothing....

835
01:05:47,089 --> 01:05:49,250
Twenty doIIars an hour.

836
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:51,990
Done.

837
01:05:58,167 --> 01:06:02,160
HeIIo. WeIcome to Monica's.
May I take your coat?

838
01:06:05,207 --> 01:06:07,198
-Hi, Steve.
-HeIIo, Monica.

839
01:06:07,976 --> 01:06:10,035
HeIIo, greeter girI.

840
01:06:10,212 --> 01:06:13,204
-This is RacheI.
-Yeah, okay.

841
01:06:15,083 --> 01:06:17,108
Everything smeIIs so deIicious.

842
01:06:17,186 --> 01:06:21,987
I can't remember ever smeIIing
such a deIicious combination of--

843
01:06:22,024 --> 01:06:23,116
Okay, smeIIs.

844
01:06:24,993 --> 01:06:29,020
-It's a IoveIy apartment.
-Thank you. WouId you Iike a tour?

845
01:06:29,131 --> 01:06:32,157
I was just being poIite,
but aII right.

846
01:06:35,137 --> 01:06:38,038
-What's up?
-In the cab on the way over...

847
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:40,938
...Steve bIazed up a doobie.

848
01:06:42,044 --> 01:06:43,136
What?

849
01:06:43,946 --> 01:06:48,042
Smoked a joint, you know?
Lit a bone. Weed, hemp, ganja--

850
01:06:49,184 --> 01:06:51,152
I'm with you, Cheech.

851
01:06:53,188 --> 01:06:58,057
-Do you think he's gonna be cooI?
-Is it dry in here?

852
01:07:00,963 --> 01:07:02,954
Let me get you some wine.

853
01:07:03,065 --> 01:07:06,159
I think we're ready
for our first course too.

854
01:07:08,971 --> 01:07:13,169
These are rock shrimp ravioIi
in a ciIantro ponzu sauce...

855
01:07:13,976 --> 01:07:16,171
...with just a touch of minced...

856
01:07:21,116 --> 01:07:23,084
...ginger.

857
01:07:23,118 --> 01:07:26,952
WeII, smack my ass and caII me Judy!

858
01:07:29,925 --> 01:07:33,918
-These are fantastic!
-Gosh! I'm so gIad you Iiked them.

859
01:07:34,029 --> 01:07:37,123
Like them? I couId eat 100 of them!

860
01:07:39,935 --> 01:07:41,926
That's aII there is of these...

861
01:07:42,037 --> 01:07:45,131
...but in a few minutes,
we'II serve some tartIets.

862
01:07:45,974 --> 01:07:47,168
''TartIets''?

863
01:07:47,943 --> 01:07:49,137
''TartIets.''

864
01:07:50,078 --> 01:07:52,046
''TartIets.''

865
01:07:53,949 --> 01:07:55,940
Word has Iost aII meaning.

866
01:08:02,090 --> 01:08:05,059
Excuse me.
Can I heIp you with anything?

867
01:08:05,093 --> 01:08:08,995
You know, I don't know
what I'm Iooking for.

868
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:26,104
CooI! Taco sheIIs!

869
01:08:28,183 --> 01:08:31,983
They're Iike a IittIe
corn enveIope, you know?

870
01:08:32,087 --> 01:08:37,024
-You don't wanna spoiI your appetite.
-Hey, Sugar-O's!

871
01:08:37,092 --> 01:08:40,186
You know, if you just wait
another 6 1 /2 minutes--

872
01:08:40,996 --> 01:08:44,193
Macaroni and cheese!
We gotta make this!

873
01:08:48,203 --> 01:08:52,139
-No, we don't.
-Oh, okay.

874
01:08:53,108 --> 01:08:55,008
Sorry.

875
01:08:59,014 --> 01:09:01,209
Why don't you just have a seat here?

876
01:09:07,055 --> 01:09:10,320
-Give me the gummy bears.
-No.

877
01:09:12,327 --> 01:09:15,023
-Give them to me.
-We'II share.

878
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:18,224
-No. Give me the bears.
-You can't have any.

879
01:09:19,034 --> 01:09:21,025
It's not worth it!

880
01:09:21,136 --> 01:09:24,071
Bears overboard! They're drowning!

881
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:29,074
Don't just stand there.
CaII 9-1 -1 .

882
01:09:29,177 --> 01:09:33,011
Hey, feIIas, grab onto a Sugar-O!
Save yourseIves!

883
01:09:33,081 --> 01:09:38,075
HeIp! HeIp, I'm drowning!

884
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:42,088
-That's it! Dinner is over!
-What! Why?

885
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:47,093
Why? What if I came into your office
and I started...?

886
01:09:47,195 --> 01:09:49,129
I can't think of an exampIe.

887
01:09:49,197 --> 01:09:53,031
I've waited seven years
for an opportunity Iike this...

888
01:09:53,135 --> 01:09:57,003
...and you can't wait 4 1 /2 minutes
for a tartIet?

889
01:10:05,213 --> 01:10:08,148
So I toId him,
''I'm sorry. That's how I feeI.''

890
01:10:08,216 --> 01:10:12,152
And he toId me I harsh-ed his buzz.

891
01:10:13,121 --> 01:10:17,114
Then I said, ''Don't eat that.
It's a kitchen magnet.''

892
01:10:18,226 --> 01:10:23,163
And he didn't Iisten,
so we Ieft him in the emergency room.

893
01:10:23,265 --> 01:10:27,998
-Mon, I'm sorry.
-What a tooI.

894
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:33,063
-You did the right thing.
-You don't wanna work for that guy.

895
01:10:33,175 --> 01:10:36,076
I just thought that this was it.

896
01:10:36,178 --> 01:10:42,174
-Don't worry. You're an amazing chef.
-Those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.

897
01:10:43,118 --> 01:10:46,087
Am I gonna get paid
for the fuII three hours?

898
01:10:46,121 --> 01:10:49,989
Just a question.
We'II taIk about it Iater.

899
01:10:54,096 --> 01:10:56,087
So, how did it go with CeIia?

900
01:10:57,999 --> 01:11:01,992
-I was unbeIievabIe.
-AII right, Ross!

901
01:11:02,104 --> 01:11:04,299
I was the James Michener
of dirty taIk.

902
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,235
It was the most eIaborate fiIth
ever heard.

903
01:11:08,043 --> 01:11:13,106
I mean, there were characters,
pIot Iines, themes, a motif.

904
01:11:13,215 --> 01:11:16,116
At one point, there were viIIagers.

905
01:11:18,053 --> 01:11:19,111
And--?

906
01:11:21,022 --> 01:11:24,048
By the time we finished
aII the dirty taIk...

907
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:26,252
...it was Iate
and we were exhausted--

908
01:11:26,995 --> 01:11:29,190
-You cuddIed.
-Yeah, which was nice.

909
01:11:30,065 --> 01:11:33,193
Do you guys want to try to catch
a Iate movie?

910
01:11:34,002 --> 01:11:37,199
-ShouIdn't we wait for ChandIer?
-Where the heII is he?

911
01:11:38,073 --> 01:11:40,007
I know what time it is...

912
01:11:40,108 --> 01:11:44,010
...but I'm Iooking at the WENUS
and I'm not happy!

913
01:11:44,212 --> 01:11:46,180
Let me teII you something.

914
01:11:46,982 --> 01:11:52,010
You wiII care about it because
I care about it. Got it? Good!

915
01:12:07,002 --> 01:12:08,196
How's this?

916
01:12:09,004 --> 01:12:11,097
Sorry. How about over here?

917
01:12:11,139 --> 01:12:13,107
That means it's working.

918
01:12:13,141 --> 01:12:15,132
-Does this hurt?
-No.

919
01:12:16,011 --> 01:12:18,002
How about this?

920
01:12:18,146 --> 01:12:20,239
There you go!
