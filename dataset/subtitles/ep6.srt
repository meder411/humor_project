1
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:04,236
Who the winny-binny boy?

2
00:00:05,238 --> 00:00:09,231
You the winny-winny-binny-binny boy!
Yes.

3
00:00:10,443 --> 00:00:12,434
Now, don't cry.

4
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:15,237
Don't cry.

5
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:19,247
Why is he stiII crying?

6
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:24,389
Don't worry. It's nothing that can't
be soIved by ''happy keys.''

7
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:29,251
I feeI better when someone
shakes jagged metaI in my face.

8
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:31,262
AII right, here.

9
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:33,455
Let me hoId him for a sec.

10
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:35,359
Here we go.

11
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,369
There we are.

12
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:40,398
Maybe it's me.

13
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:44,466
Don't be siIIy. Ben Ioves you.
He's being Mr. Cranky Pants.

14
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:48,304
You know, I once dated
a Miss Cranky Pants.

15
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:51,382
LoveIy girI. Kind of moody.

16
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,286
There we go. AII better.

17
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,478
There's my IittIe boy.

18
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,288
Can I see something?

19
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,442
-CooI!
-He hates me. My nephew hates me!

20
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:26,443
-I'm unempIoyed and he hates me.
-Don't do this.

21
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,346
You're just unempIoyed.

22
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:33,291
What if my own baby hates me?
What do I do?

23
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,553
Monica, this is nuts!

24
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:39,288
You know how Iong it'II be
before you have to deaI with this?

25
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,496
You don't even have a boyfriend yet.

26
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,364
Joey, she does not Iook fat.

27
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,365
The One With the Baby on the Bus

28
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,381
-Here you go.
-Hey, Mon.

29
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,394
Goo, goo, goo!

30
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,563
That is so funny!
Let me see that a sec.

31
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,306
-You okay, Ross?
-I don't know.

32
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,405
What's in this pie?

33
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:05,412
I don't know. Butter and eggs,
fIour and Iime and kiwi--

34
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:08,215
Kiwi? Kiwi?!

35
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,219
You said it was key Iime.

36
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:14,259
No, I said kiwi Iime.
That's what makes it speciaI.

37
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:17,225
That's what's gonna kiII me.

38
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:19,457
I'm aIIergic to kiwi.

39
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:24,235
No, you're not. You're aIIergic
to Iobster, peanuts and--

40
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,364
Oh, my God!

41
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,241
-It's definiteIy getting worse.
-Is your tongue sweIIing up?

42
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,347
Either that or my mouth
is getting smaIIer!

43
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:38,245
We're going to the hospitaI.

44
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,376
-Is he okay?
-He's gotta get a shot.

45
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:44,253
You know, actuaIIy
it's getting better. It is.

46
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,450
Let's not go.
Anyone for ScrabbIe?

47
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,461
Jacket, now!

48
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:53,494
What about Ben? We can't
bring a baby to the hospitaI.

49
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,460
We'II watch him.

50
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:57,462
I don't think so.

51
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:03,231
I have seven CathoIic sisters.
I take care of hundreds of kids.

52
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:08,210
-We wanna do it. Don't we?
-I was gonna pIay basketbaII but...

53
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:10,339
...I guess that's out the window.

54
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:14,309
If you take him for a waIk,
remember his hat.

55
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,321
There's miIk in the fridge
and extra diapers.

56
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,220
Hat, miIk....

57
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:22,226
-Got it!
-Let's go.

58
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,232
Consider it done!

59
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:36,238
-You understood that?
-My uncIe SaI has a reaIIy big tongue.

60
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:40,244
Is he the one
with the beautifuI wife?

61
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:49,353
Want to hear the song
I'm singing this afternoon?

62
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,483
-I wrote it this morning in the shower.
-Okay.

63
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,490
<i>I'm in the shower</i>
<i>And I'm writing a song</i>

64
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:03,199
<i>Stop me if you've heard it</i>

65
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:09,297
<i>My skin is soapy and my hair is wet</i>

66
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:13,403
<i>And Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget</i>

67
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:21,411
RacheI, sweetheart,
couId I see you for a minute?

68
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,451
What's up?

69
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,454
FYI:

70
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:33,323
I've decided to pay a professionaI
musician to pIay on Sundays.

71
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:37,426
Her name's Stephanie something.
She's supposed to be very good.

72
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:41,263
-But what about Phoebe?
-RacheI...

73
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,434
...it's not that your friend is bad.

74
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:46,435
It's that she's so bad...

75
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:52,478
...she makes me want to put my finger
through my eye into my brain...

76
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,480
...and swirI it around.

77
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,354
Okay, so you're not a fan.

78
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:03,421
But, I mean, come on.
You cannot do this to her.

79
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,425
Oh, no.

80
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,393
I have to do this?

81
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:11,198
<i>Lather, rinse, repeat</i>

82
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,296
<i>And lather, rinse, repeat</i>

83
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:17,206
<i>And lather, rinse, repeat</i>

84
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,210
<i>As needed</i>

85
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,318
We didn't bring enough.

86
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,412
Did you forget to pack
the baby's anviI?

87
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,248
It'II be worth it.

88
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:35,325
It's a fact that women Iove babies.

89
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:39,525
Women Iove guys who Iove babies.
It's the sensitive thing.

90
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:44,259
Aim him at that pack of babes.
Maybe one wiII break away.

91
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:48,237
Wait, forget them.
We got one. Hard Ieft.

92
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,242
-Give me the baby.
-I got him.

93
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,471
-Come on, seriousIy.
-Oh, seriousIy you want him?

94
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,372
HeIIo.

95
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,278
HeIIo.

96
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,477
Who is this cutie-pie?

97
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,481
WeII, don't think me immodest, but...

98
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:04,382
...me.

99
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:09,286
-Want to smeII him?
-We're taIking about the baby?

100
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:16,294
He's got that great baby smeII.
Get a whiff of his head.

101
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:20,201
My uterus just skipped a beat.

102
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,431
What'd I teII you?

103
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:26,200
-It's great you're doing this.
-WeII, we are great guys.

104
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:29,305
My brother and his boyfriend
are trying to adopt.

105
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:32,317
What agency did you two go through?

106
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:38,253
But this is my gig.

107
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:39,450
This is where I pIay.

108
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,421
My name is written out there in chaIk.

109
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:46,228
You know, you can't just erase chaIk.

110
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,265
Honey, I'm sorry.

111
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,429
And he's going to
be pay this woman?

112
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,238
Why doesn't he give her a throne
and a crown?

113
00:07:56,342 --> 00:08:01,177
And, Iike, a goId stick
with a baII on top?

114
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,282
Terry is a jerk! That's why we say,
''Terry's a jerk!''

115
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:08,285
That's where that came from.

116
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,281
Yeah, okay. You probabIy did
everything you couId.

117
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:18,423
Okay, you know what? Let me just see
what eIse I can do.

118
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,295
AII right. Let her go on after
Stephanie whatever-her-name-is.

119
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,498
You won't be here. Don't pay her.

120
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,434
-I don't know.
-I'II cIean the cappuccino machine!

121
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,304
You don't cIean
the cappuccino machine?

122
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,444
Of course I cIean it.

123
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,446
I mean, I wiII cIean it.

124
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:45,418
-I mean, I wiII cIean it.
-AII right, fine!

125
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:52,260
-Done.
-ReaIIy?

126
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,322
Who's working for you, babe?

127
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:59,268
Oh, my God! This is so exciting!
How much am I gonna get?

128
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,396
What?

129
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,199
You said he's paying
the peopIe who pIay.

130
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:09,314
I meant, he's paying that other woman
because she's a professionaI.

131
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:13,310
I'm not gonna be the onIy one
not getting paid.

132
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,411
-But Pheebs--
-No, I'm sorry, no!

133
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:20,385
No, I'm not some sIoppy second,
you know, charity band.

134
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:23,293
There are thousands of pIaces...

135
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,297
...where peopIe wouId pay
to hear me pIay.

136
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,300
<i>When I play, I play for me</i>

137
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,392
<i>I don't need your charity</i>

138
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,300
Thank you!

139
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:43,440
I'm not getting a shot.
They can take the needIe...

140
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,242
...and squirt it in my mouth.
Like a squirt gun.

141
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,254
See what the doctor says.

142
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:53,223
They've got to do something.
These are the '90s.

143
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,452
HeIIo, there. I'm Dr. CarIin.

144
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,457
I see someone's having
a IittIe aIIergic reaction.

145
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,326
Doctor, can I see you
for just a moment?

146
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,429
My brother has a sIight phobia
about needIes.

147
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:12,240
Did you teII him
about my squirt gun idea?

148
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,439
My brother wouId Iike to know...

149
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:19,247
...if there's a way
to treat this oraIIy?

150
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:24,346
Under these circumstances, it has to
be an injection and it has to be now.

151
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,550
So?

152
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:32,354
Have a seat. The doctor says
it's gotta be a needIe.

153
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:37,392
You're just gonna have to be brave.
Can you do that for me?

154
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,564
-Okay.
-Okay. Oh, boy!

155
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,502
You are doing so good.

156
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,505
You want to squeeze my hand?

157
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,504
Ross, don't squeeze it so hard.

158
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,477
Honey, reaIIy.
Don't squeeze it so hard!

159
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,418
Ross, Iet go of my hand!

160
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,417
Good. Next time we pick up women...

161
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:03,428
...we shouId go to the park
and make out.

162
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,322
Taxi! Taxi!

163
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:10,459
Hey, Iook at that taIent.

164
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,329
Just practicing. You're good.

165
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,271
Carry on.

166
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,366
Wait, wait, wait!

167
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:22,243
Hey, you. He is just adorabIe.

168
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:26,342
Can you teII him that?
Because he thinks he Iooks too pink.

169
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,348
-What are you guys out doing today?
-We're not out.

170
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,489
We're two hetero guys
hanging with the son...

171
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:41,255
...of our other heterosexuaI friend,
doing the usuaI straight-guy stuff.

172
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,458
-You done?
-Yeah.

173
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:45,463
There's our stop.

174
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,467
Get out of here! This is our stop.

175
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,475
You guys Iive here too?

176
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,507
We Iive in the buiIding
by the sidewaIk.

177
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,283
Do you know it?

178
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:03,420
Since we're neighbors, what do you say
we get together for a drink?

179
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,252
So you wanna go to MarqueI's?

180
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,356
Sure, they Iove us.

181
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,358
Where's your baby?

182
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,240
Ben! Ben!

183
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:27,244
That's good. Maybe he'II
hear you and puII the cord!

184
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,338
-Stop the bus! Hey!
-No!

185
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:32,373
-We need the baby!
-Wait!

186
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,482
You sure it didn't break?
It hurts.

187
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,353
No, it's just a good bone bruise.

188
00:12:44,296 --> 00:12:48,460
And right here is the puncture wound
from your ring.

189
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,463
-I'm reaIIy sorry.
-It's okay.

190
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,363
Sorry.

191
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:57,408
Sorry! Hey! I got my ''S''s back!

192
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:00,340
Which we can ceIebrate Iater.

193
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,442
CeIebrate. CeIebrate....

194
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,250
<i>He was a double, double</i>

195
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:09,446
<i>Double-jointed boy</i>

196
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:15,216
Hey, so are you the professionaI
guitar pIayer?

197
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:17,258
Yeah, I'm Stephanie.

198
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,422
Right. My name was on there.
Now it just says carrot cake.

199
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:27,228
-Okay.
-So how many chords do you know?

200
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:30,237
-AII of them.
-So you know D?

201
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:34,437
-Yeah.
-Okay. Do you know A-minor?

202
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:40,350
Okay, do you know
how to go from D to A-minor?

203
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:43,285
-Yeah.
-Okay.

204
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:46,390
So does your guitar have a strap?

205
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,353
-No.
-Mine does.

206
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,269
<i>Stephanie knows all the chords</i>

207
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,330
Come on! Pick up, pick up! HeIIo.

208
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:06,402
Transit Authority? Yes. HeIIo.
I'm doing research for a book.

209
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:12,213
I was wondering what somebody might do
if they Ieft a baby on a city bus.

210
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,319
Yes, I reaIize that wouId be stupid.

211
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:18,254
We Iost a car seat on a bus today.

212
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,451
It's white pIastic
and it fits onto a stroIIer.

213
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,320
And there was a baby in it.

214
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,322
He wants to taIk to you again.

215
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:31,530
Everybody, Iet's give a warm
CentraI Perk weIcome to--

216
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,240
<i>Terry's a jerk</i>
<i>And he won't let me work</i>

217
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,242
<i>And I hate Central Perk</i>

218
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,381
To Stephanie Schiffer!

219
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:54,258
I'd Iike to start with a song I wrote
for the first man I ever Ioved.

220
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,388
<i>Zachary--</i>

221
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:01,399
<i>Are all invited to bite me</i>

222
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:14,344
We're the guys that caIIed
about the baby! Is he here?

223
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,440
He's here.

224
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,216
Is one of you the father?

225
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,254
-That's me.
-I'm him.

226
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:29,420
ActuaIIy, we're both the father.

227
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,372
-Oh, Ben!
-Hey, buddy.

228
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:50,348
TeII me you know
which one is our baby.

229
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:54,375
One has ducks on his shirt
and one has cIowns.

230
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:58,445
And Ben was definiteIy wearing ducks.
Or cIowns.

231
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:04,422
That one's Ben! Remember, he had
that IittIe moIe by his mouth!

232
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,323
Hey, Ben! Remember us?

233
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,402
Okay, the moIe came off.

234
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,229
What are we gonna do?

235
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,298
FIip for it.
Ducks or cIowns.

236
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,334
We're gonna fIip for the baby?

237
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,312
AII right, caII it in the air.

238
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,442
-Heads.
-Heads, it is.

239
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:31,423
We have to assign heads to something!

240
00:16:32,424 --> 00:16:35,359
Right! Okay.

241
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:40,421
Ducks is heads
because ducks have heads.

242
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,433
What kind of scary-ass cIowns
came to your birthday?

243
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:46,443
-Hey.
-Oh, hi.

244
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:49,414
Here. I thought you might be coId.

245
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:51,314
Thank you.

246
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,364
Look at you!
You did weII.

247
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,225
8 doIIars and 27 cents.

248
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,534
But not reaIIy
because I put in the first two.

249
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:12,232
Just to get the baII roIIing
and to make myseIf feeI better.

250
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:15,345
-Do you?
-No.

251
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,339
This whoIe pIaying for money thing
is so not good for me.

252
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,445
I don't know, when I sang
''Su-Su-Suicide''...

253
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,384
...I got, Iike, $1 .75.

254
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:30,489
But then ''SmeIIy Cat''?

255
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:36,263
I got 25 cents and a condom.

256
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:41,362
So, you know, now I just feeI
reaIIy bad for ''SmeIIy Cat.''

257
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:47,469
Honey, I don't think
everybody gets ''SmeIIy Cat.''

258
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,512
I mean, if aII you've ever actuaIIy
had are heaIthy pets, then whoosh!

259
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:57,317
But it's not even that, you know?

260
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,256
I pIayed my songs
because it made me happy.

261
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:04,318
Now it's just aII
about the money, you know?

262
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,257
PeopIe missed you in there.

263
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:12,360
In fact, there was a request
for ''SmeIIy Cat.''

264
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:14,364
ReaIIy? From who?

265
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,231
WeII, me.

266
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:22,270
I know it's not your big money song,
but it's my favorite.

267
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:29,482
Hi. Did I accidentaIIy drop a condom
in your case?

268
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,256
-It's kind of an emergency.
-Yeah.

269
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:38,388
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

270
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,488
Hey, Christine! I got it!

271
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,275
I want to thank you
for being there for me.

272
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,468
Sorry I aImost broke your hand.

273
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:56,470
That's okay.
I'm sorry I poisoned you.

274
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,417
Remember when I jammed
a penciI into your hand?

275
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:05,314
Remember it? What do you
think this is, a freckIe?

276
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:10,317
What about the time I hit you
in the face with a pumpkin?

277
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:13,263
Remember, I stuck a broom
in your spokes...

278
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,234
-...and you hit your head on a curb?
-No.

279
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:20,261
But I remember
peopIe teIIing me about it.

280
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,242
-I hope Ben has a IittIe sister.
-Yeah.

281
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:28,246
And I hope she can kick his ass.

282
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:31,280
I'm gonna get a new Band-Aid.

283
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,250
How about when I cut the Iegs
off your MaIibu Ken?

284
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,446
That was you?

285
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,283
They were infected.
He wouIdn't have made it.

286
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,457
My IittIe nephew.

287
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,397
Come here, IittIe one!

288
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:54,271
There's my IittIe baby Ben!

289
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,500
Hey, my IittIe boy.

290
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,402
Hey, he's not crying!

291
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:07,216
Hey, he's not crying!

292
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:11,347
Yes!

293
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,516
There's stiII pie!

294
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:18,260
I'm here. I'm here.

295
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:20,454
How's my IittIe boy?

296
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:25,463
You want Daddy to change
your diaper? I know, I know.

297
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:30,365
Did you have fun with UncIe Joey
and UncIe ChandIer today?

298
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:33,467
Yeah. He rode the bus today.

299
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:40,284
Big boy riding the bus--

300
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,481
Hey, I have a question.

301
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:49,383
How come it says ''Property
of Human Services'' on his butt?

302
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,457
You....

303
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,560
You are gonna Iove this.

304
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,459
Can you hoId Ben for a sec?

305
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,238
Come here.

306
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:04,241
Stay back! I've got kiwi!
Run, Joey, run!

307
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:12,316
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

308
00:24:12,417 --> 00:24:15,250
<i>What are they feeding you?</i>

309
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:20,317
No, no. I'm sorry, it's:
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

310
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:28,331
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

311
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:30,367
-Better!
-Yeah?

312
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,335
Much better. Good.

313
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,533
Don't feeI bad
because it's a hard song.

314
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:39,343
-You want to try it again?
-From the top?

315
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:42,242
There is no ''top,'' aII right?

316
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:45,248
That's the beauty of ''SmeIIy Cat.''

317
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,455
-Why don't you just foIIow me?
-Okay.

318
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:54,391
<i>Smelly cat, smelly cat</i>

319
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:57,394

That's too much. Sorry.
