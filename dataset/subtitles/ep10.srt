287
00:24:00,874 --> 00:24:04,002
Guys, there's somebody
I'd Iike you to meet.

288
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,108
Wait, wait. What is that?

289
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:11,874
-That's MarceI. Wanna say hi?
-No, I don't.

290
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:16,082
-He's cute! Where'd you get him?
-My friend BetheI saved him from a Iab.

291
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:17,982
That is so crueI.

292
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:21,085
Why wouId a parent
name their chiId BetheI?

293
00:24:24,898 --> 00:24:27,093
That monkey's got a Ross on his ass.

294
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:34,907
Is he gonna Iive with you
in your apartment?

295
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:37,943
Yeah. It's been kind of quiet
since CaroI Ieft.

296
00:24:38,045 --> 00:24:39,979
Why not get a roommate?

297
00:24:40,047 --> 00:24:45,075
You reach a certain age, having
a roommate is just kind of pathet--

298
00:24:48,055 --> 00:24:52,082
That's ''pathet.'' Sanskrit for
''reaIIy cooI way to Iive.''

299
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,985
The One With the Monkey

300
00:25:41,942 --> 00:25:44,035
I'm doing new materiaI tonight.

301
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:48,980
I have 1 2 songs about my mother's
suicide and one about a snowman.

302
00:25:51,017 --> 00:25:53,952
You might wanna open with the snowman.

303
00:25:54,988 --> 00:25:57,047
-Hi, Joey.
-Hey, buddy.

304
00:25:57,858 --> 00:26:01,851
-So how'd it go?
-I didn't get the job.

305
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:05,865
How couId you not?
You were Santa Iast year.

306
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,859
Some fat guy's sIeeping
with the store manager.

307
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:14,974
He's not even joIIy.
It's aII poIiticaI.

308
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:18,068
-What are you gonna be?
-One of his heIpers.

309
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:21,871
It's just such a sIap in the face,
you know?

310
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:25,009
Do you know what you're doing
for New Year's?

311
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:29,020
Hey, what?
What is wrong with New Year's?

312
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:33,890
You have PaoIo. You don't have
to face the pressure...

313
00:26:33,994 --> 00:26:37,862
...of finding Iips to kiss
when the baII drops!

314
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:39,864
Man, I'm taIking Ioud!

315
00:26:41,034 --> 00:26:44,868
PaoIo's gonna be in Rome
this New Year's.

316
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:48,931
-I'II be just as pathetic as you.
-Yeah, you wish.

317
00:26:50,877 --> 00:26:52,936
I've got an idea. Dinner.

318
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:56,948
It's perfect. We'II put it between
Iunch and breakfast.

319
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:02,082
I'm sick of being a victim
of this Dick CIark hoIiday.

320
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:06,950
I say this year, we make a pact.
Just the six of us. Dinner.

321
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:08,085
-Sure.
-Fine.

322
00:27:08,895 --> 00:27:10,988
I was hoping for more enthusiasm.

323
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:16,060
-Phoebe, you're on.
-Oh, good.

324
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:20,067
Hi. Ladies and gentIemen,
back by popuIar demand...

325
00:27:20,874 --> 00:27:22,899
...Miss Phoebe Buffay.

326
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,104
Hi. Thanks. Hi.

327
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:33,017
I wanna start with a song
that means a Iot to me.

328
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:41,817
<i>I made a man with eyes of coal</i>

329
00:27:41,928 --> 00:27:44,954
<i>And a smile so bewitching</i>

330
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:48,025
<i>How was I supposed to know</i>

331
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:51,065
<i>That my mom was dead in the kitchen?</i>

332
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:00,938
<i>My mother's ashes</i>

333
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:04,050
<i>Even her eyelashes</i>

334
00:28:04,885 --> 00:28:10,846
<i>Are resting in a little yellow jar</i>

335
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,994
<i>And sometimes when it's freezing</i>

336
00:28:16,897 --> 00:28:18,990
<i>I feel a little sneezy</i>

337
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:24,064
<i>And now I--</i> Excuse me?
Excuse me? Yeah, noisy boys.

338
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:29,908
Is it something you'd Iike
to share with the group?

339
00:28:30,977 --> 00:28:33,104
No. No, that's okay.

340
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,815
If it's important enough
whiIe I'm pIaying...

341
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,910
...it's important enough
for everyone eIse.

342
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,853
That guy's going home with a note.

343
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:50,825
-I was just saying--
-Speak up.

344
00:28:50,931 --> 00:28:51,920
Sorry, I--

345
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:57,029
I was saying you were the most
beautifuI woman I'd ever seen.

346
00:28:57,837 --> 00:28:59,862
And he said that DaryI Hannah...

347
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,034
...was the most beautifuI woman
he'd ever seen.

348
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:06,840
I said I Iiked her in <i>Splash,</i>
but not <i>Wall Street.</i>

349
00:29:06,947 --> 00:29:09,939
I thought she had a hard quaIity.

350
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:14,045
WhiIe DaryI is beautifuI
in a conventionaI way...

351
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:17,955
...you are Iuminous
with a kind of deIicate grace.

352
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,852
Then that's when you started yeIIing.

353
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:33,868
We're gonna take a short break.

354
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:40,903
That guy's going home
with more than a note.

355
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,819
Come here, MarceI. Sit here.

356
00:29:51,858 --> 00:29:54,850
I can't beIieve he hasn't
kissed you yet.

357
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:59,831
By my sixth date with PaoIo,
he'd aIready named both my breasts.

358
00:30:02,936 --> 00:30:05,029
Did I just share too much?

359
00:30:06,873 --> 00:30:08,067
Just a smidge.

360
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:12,876
David's, Iike, a scientist guy.
He's very methodicaI.

361
00:30:12,946 --> 00:30:14,971
-I think it's romantic.
-Me too!

362
00:30:15,048 --> 00:30:18,882
Did you ever see
<i>An Officer and a Gentleman</i>?

363
00:30:18,985 --> 00:30:22,853
He's kind of Iike the guy
I went to see that with.

364
00:30:27,861 --> 00:30:31,888
Except he's smarter and gentIer
and sweeter.

365
00:30:32,098 --> 00:30:34,999
I just wanna be with him aII the time.

366
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:38,832
You know, day and night.
And night and day.

367
00:30:38,905 --> 00:30:41,806
And speciaI occasions.

368
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,902
I see. You're gonna ask him
to New Year's.

369
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:51,006
-She's gonna break the pact.
-No! No, no.

370
00:30:51,051 --> 00:30:53,815
No. Yeah, couId I just--?

371
00:30:56,056 --> 00:30:59,025
-Yeah. I aIready asked Janice.
-What?

372
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:01,960
This was a pact! This was your pact!

373
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:04,929
I couIdn't handIe the pressure.
I snapped!

374
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:07,966
But that was the worst breakup
in history!

375
00:31:08,068 --> 00:31:11,868
I'm not saying it was a good idea.
I snapped!

376
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:15,941
Hi, sorry I'm Iate.

377
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,050
Too many jokes.

378
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:28,978
Must mock Joey.

379
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:33,859
Nice shoes, huh?

380
00:31:34,861 --> 00:31:36,089
God, you're kiIIing me!

381
00:31:38,031 --> 00:31:41,797
Ross, he's pIaying
with my spatuIas again!

382
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:46,804
-He's not gonna hurt them, right?
-Do you aIways have to bring him?

383
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:52,844
I didn't wanna Ieave him aIone.
We had our first fight this morning.

384
00:31:54,047 --> 00:31:59,815
It has to do with my working Iate.
I said some things that I didn't mean.

385
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:03,919
He threw some feces.

386
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,952
If you're working Iate,
I can Iook in on him.

387
00:32:10,063 --> 00:32:11,928
That wouId be great!

388
00:32:12,065 --> 00:32:15,967
But make sure it seems
Iike you're there to see him.

389
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:18,026
You're not doing it for me.

390
00:32:18,838 --> 00:32:21,830
Okay. But if he asks,
I'm not going to Iie.

391
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:30,880
But you can't actuaIIy
test this theory.

392
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,943
Today's particIe acceIerators
aren't powerfuI enough...

393
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:39,787
-...to simuIate these conditions.
-I have a question then.

394
00:32:39,826 --> 00:32:42,021
-Yeah?
-Do you pIan on kissing me ever?

395
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:50,900
That's definiteIy a vaIid question,
and the answer...

396
00:32:51,004 --> 00:32:54,906
...wouId be yes. Yes, I was.

397
00:32:59,045 --> 00:33:02,811
But I wanted it to be
this phenomenaI kiss...

398
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:05,942
...at a phenomenaI moment
because it's you.

399
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:07,008
Sure.

400
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,813
The Ionger I waited, the more
phenomenaI the kiss had to be.

401
00:33:11,858 --> 00:33:15,851
Now, it's just gotta be
one of those things where I...

402
00:33:15,962 --> 00:33:18,954
...sweep everything off the tabIe.

403
00:33:19,065 --> 00:33:21,966
And I'm not reaIIy
a sweeping sort of feIIa.

404
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:26,061
David, I think you are
a sweeping sort of feIIa.

405
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:30,935
I mean, you're a sweeper
trapped inside a physicist's body.

406
00:33:31,945 --> 00:33:33,071
-ReaIIy?
-I'm sure.

407
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:36,838
You shouId just do it. Just throw me.

408
00:33:39,953 --> 00:33:42,046
-Now?
-Yeah, right now. Just....

409
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:44,089
Okay. Okay. Okay.

410
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,961
You know what?
This is reaIIy expensive.

411
00:33:51,064 --> 00:33:52,998
And this was a gift.

412
00:33:54,067 --> 00:33:57,059
-Now you're just tidying up.
-Okay.

413
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:04,866
-You want me to throw you--?
-I can hop.

414
00:34:20,994 --> 00:34:25,021
TeII me something, what does
''no-date pact'' mean to you?

415
00:34:25,098 --> 00:34:29,000
It's just that ChandIer
and Phoebe have somebody.

416
00:34:29,102 --> 00:34:31,093
I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.

417
00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:33,196
-Your ex-boyfriend?
-Yeah.

418
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:38,068
-You know more than one Fun Bobby?
-I happen to know a Fun Bob.

419
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,948
-Okay. Here we go.
-There's no room for miIk.

420
00:34:50,056 --> 00:34:52,081
There. Now there is.

421
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:56,989
So on our no-date evening,
three of you now have dates.

422
00:34:57,864 --> 00:34:59,957
-Four.
-Five.

423
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,061
Sorry. PaoIo's catching
an earIier fIight.

424
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,964
And I met this reaIIy hot
singIe mom at the store.

425
00:35:07,874 --> 00:35:09,068
What's an eIf to do?

426
00:35:09,976 --> 00:35:14,072
So I'II be the onIy one aIone
when the baII drops?

427
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:18,908
We'II have a big party,
and no one wiII know who's with who.

428
00:35:18,985 --> 00:35:22,978
I'II know. This is so not
what I needed right now.

429
00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:25,887
-What's the matter?
-Oh, it's MarceI.

430
00:35:28,094 --> 00:35:33,031
He's angry with me. I have
no idea why. He keeps shutting me out.

431
00:35:33,099 --> 00:35:36,933
He's waIking around aII the time,
dragging his hands.

432
00:35:37,837 --> 00:35:40,829
That's weird.
I had a bIast with him.

433
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,931
-ReaIIy?
-We pIayed, watched TV.

434
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:45,842
That juggIing thing is amazing.

435
00:35:48,848 --> 00:35:50,839
What juggIing thing?

436
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:54,042
With the socks?
I figured you taught him that.

437
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,045
No.

438
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:01,857
It wasn't that big a deaI.
Just socks. And a meIon.

439
00:36:05,898 --> 00:36:08,059
-Phoebe!
-Max. Do you know everybody?

440
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:10,968
No. Have you seen David?

441
00:36:11,871 --> 00:36:12,997
He hasn't been around.

442
00:36:13,106 --> 00:36:17,065
If you see him, teII him to pack.
We are going to Minsk.

443
00:36:17,877 --> 00:36:20,004
-Minsk?
-Minsk. It's in Russia.

444
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:23,004
I know where Minsk is.

445
00:36:24,884 --> 00:36:28,115
We got the grant.
Three years, aII expenses paid.

446
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:32,015
And if you're gonna do Minsk,
that's the way to go.

447
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:35,186
-So when do you Ieave?
-January 1st.

448
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:48,029
-HeIIo?
-What? Hey. Hi.

449
00:36:48,841 --> 00:36:51,969
-What are you doing here?
-Max toId me about Minsk.

450
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:54,979
CongratuIations! This is so exciting!

451
00:36:56,149 --> 00:36:59,084
It'd be even more exciting
if we were going.

452
00:36:59,852 --> 00:37:02,047
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?

453
00:37:03,856 --> 00:37:05,847
TeII her. ''I don't wanna go...

454
00:37:05,892 --> 00:37:08,986
...to work with Lipson,
Yamaguchi and FIank.

455
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:12,155
I wanna stay and make out
with my girIfriend!''

456
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:15,060
Okay, thank you, Max. Thank you.

457
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:18,871
So you're reaIIy not going?

458
00:37:18,971 --> 00:37:21,963
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I just....

459
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:24,975
How can I Ieave you?
I just found you.

460
00:37:25,011 --> 00:37:28,879
Oh, David. But what are you gonna do?

461
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:33,076
I don't know. You decide.

462
00:37:33,886 --> 00:37:36,116
-Don't do that.
-But I'm asking you.

463
00:37:36,856 --> 00:37:40,019
-I can't make a decision. Just--
-Okay. Stay.

464
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:43,921
-Stay.
-Stay.

465
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:54,031
Getting so good at that!

466
00:37:55,842 --> 00:37:57,867
It was Max's stuff.

467
00:38:05,852 --> 00:38:08,082
I Iove this artichoke thing.

468
00:38:08,855 --> 00:38:11,983
Don't teII me what's in it.
The diet starts tomorrow.

469
00:38:16,863 --> 00:38:18,956
You remember Janice.

470
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:21,866
VividIy.

471
00:38:22,068 --> 00:38:25,970
-How are you?
-I am fantastic.

472
00:38:26,005 --> 00:38:26,994
Now.

473
00:38:28,908 --> 00:38:32,105
It's amazing. We've been back
together for what...

474
00:38:32,912 --> 00:38:35,176
-...Iike 10 minutes, and--
-Is that aII?

475
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:38,907
It's Iike we were never apart.

476
00:38:39,018 --> 00:38:42,818
Of course, we were, but--
Forgive and forget.

477
00:38:42,922 --> 00:38:45,015
WeII, forget.

478
00:38:55,968 --> 00:38:57,060
-Hi.
-Hi, I'm Sandy.

479
00:38:57,837 --> 00:38:59,930
Sandy, hi. Come on in.

480
00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:13,976
-You brought your kids.
-Yeah. That's okay, right?

481
00:39:16,055 --> 00:39:20,856
-Party!
-That thing is not coming in here!

482
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,053
This is how you greet guests?

483
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:27,993
If I showed up with my new girIfriend,
she wouIdn't be weIcome?

484
00:39:28,901 --> 00:39:32,894
Your new girIfriend wouIdn't urinate
on my coffee tabIe.

485
00:39:32,972 --> 00:39:36,066
He was more embarrassed
about that than anyone.

486
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:42,037
And for him to have the courage
to waIk back in here...

487
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,008
...Iike nothing happened--

488
00:39:45,017 --> 00:39:48,043
AII right. AII right.
Just keep him away from me.

489
00:39:48,854 --> 00:39:50,913
Thank you. Come on, MarceI.

490
00:39:51,123 --> 00:39:53,921
What do you say you and I mingIe?

491
00:39:54,961 --> 00:39:59,057
AII right, I'II catch up
with you Iater.

492
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:09,830
Oh, my gosh!
RacheI, honey, are you okay?

493
00:40:09,942 --> 00:40:14,879
-Where's PaoIo?
-Rome. Jerk missed his fIight.

494
00:40:15,047 --> 00:40:17,072
And then your face expIoded?

495
00:40:18,951 --> 00:40:19,975
No.

496
00:40:20,953 --> 00:40:24,855
Okay. I was at the airport
getting into a cab...

497
00:40:24,957 --> 00:40:29,894
...when this woman, this bIond
pIanet with a pocketbook...

498
00:40:29,962 --> 00:40:34,058
...starts yeIIing. Something
about how it was her cab first.

499
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:38,036
The next thing, she just
starts puIIing me out by my hair!

500
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:41,807
And I was bIowing my attack
whistIe thingy...

501
00:40:41,874 --> 00:40:44,001
...and three more cabs show up.

502
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:49,008
So as I'm going to get into a cab,
she tackIes me!

503
00:40:49,815 --> 00:40:54,843
And I hit my head on the curb
and cut my Iip on my whistIe.

504
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:00,917
Everybody having fun at the party?

505
00:41:02,962 --> 00:41:05,829
-Are peopIe eating my dip?
-Yes.

506
00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:12,029
There.

507
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:16,965
-That Iooks okay, right?
-You went a bit wide on the Iipstick.

508
00:41:17,043 --> 00:41:19,876
-Oh, I did?
-Yeah.

509
00:41:19,945 --> 00:41:23,847
It's hard for me to teII.
My eye's cIosing up.

510
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:25,884
Let me get it for you.

511
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:28,044
-Ow!
-Okay.

512
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:30,879
You know what? It Iooks fine.

513
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:33,888
Okay, here we go.

514
00:41:33,993 --> 00:41:37,929
Screw PaoIo,
screw the psycho cab Iady.

515
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:40,999
It's New Year's Eve.
Let's have a good time.

516
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:42,933
-Okay, here we go.
-Okay.

517
00:41:43,002 --> 00:41:45,994
AII right, there you go. This way.

518
00:41:47,106 --> 00:41:48,937
Here you go.

519
00:41:52,044 --> 00:41:54,911
When I saw you at the store
Iast week...

520
00:41:55,815 --> 00:41:59,945
...it was the first time
I ever mentaIIy undressed an eIf.

521
00:42:02,054 --> 00:42:06,013
-Wow, that's dirty.
-Yeah.

522
00:42:09,962 --> 00:42:11,122
Hey, kids.

523
00:42:13,032 --> 00:42:16,866
He doesn't have to spend
the whoIe evening with me...

524
00:42:16,936 --> 00:42:18,870
...but at Ieast check in.

525
00:42:20,039 --> 00:42:21,973
There you are!

526
00:42:23,843 --> 00:42:26,038
You got away from me.

527
00:42:26,846 --> 00:42:30,839
-But you found me.
-Here, Ross, take our picture.

528
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:34,044
SmiIe. You're on Janice Camera.

529
00:42:34,987 --> 00:42:36,818
IKiII me. IKiII me now.

530
00:42:41,827 --> 00:42:44,091
Hi, I'm RacheI.

531
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,923
So whose friend are you?

532
00:42:50,803 --> 00:42:53,931
Look at me, spiIIing everywhere.

533
00:42:55,908 --> 00:42:57,842
Everybody, it's Fun Bobby!

534
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:04,040
Hey, sorry I'm Iate.
But my grandfather...

535
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,112
...died about two hours ago.

536
00:43:06,852 --> 00:43:12,051
But I couIdn't get a fIight
out tiII tomorrow, so here I am.

537
00:43:12,925 --> 00:43:18,056
Hey, Fun Bobby! How's it going, man?
Whoa! Who died?

538
00:43:22,835 --> 00:43:25,133
It's gonna be an open casket,
you know?

539
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:29,137
So at Ieast I'II get to see him again.

540
00:43:33,846 --> 00:43:36,940
Bobby? Fun Bobby?

541
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:40,043
Let me taIk to you for just a sec.

542
00:43:40,886 --> 00:43:43,047
I recentIy Iost
a grandparent myseIf...

543
00:43:43,155 --> 00:43:46,090
...so I reaIIy know exactIy
how you feeI.

544
00:43:46,892 --> 00:43:49,861
But you're reaIIy bringing
the party down.

545
00:43:50,963 --> 00:43:53,056
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah, yeah, okay.

546
00:43:54,166 --> 00:43:56,157
There you go. There you go.

547
00:43:57,903 --> 00:44:02,863
I'm gonna bIow this one up
and write ''Reunited'' in gIitter.

548
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:04,909
AII right, Janice, that's it!

549
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,877
Janice. Janice.

550
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:12,883
Hey, Janice, when I invited you,
I didn't think it meant--

551
00:44:12,985 --> 00:44:15,010
Oh, no!

552
00:44:19,091 --> 00:44:21,889
I'm sorry you misunderstood.

553
00:44:21,994 --> 00:44:24,019
You Iisten to me!
You Iisten to me!

554
00:44:24,129 --> 00:44:29,032
One of these times, it's just gonna be
your Iast chance with me!

555
00:44:31,036 --> 00:44:33,004
WiII you give me the thing?

556
00:44:36,876 --> 00:44:38,969
-Hi, Max.
-Yoko.

557
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:47,075
I've decided to go to Minsk
without you.

558
00:44:48,854 --> 00:44:51,049
-Wow.
-It won't be the same...

559
00:44:52,057 --> 00:44:55,891
...but it wiII stiII be Minsk.
Happy New Year.

560
00:44:57,096 --> 00:45:00,998
-Are you aII right?
-Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

561
00:45:06,171 --> 00:45:07,968
Come on.

562
00:45:10,009 --> 00:45:14,070
-You're going to Minsk.
-No, I'm not going to Minsk.

563
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,074
You are so going to Minsk.

564
00:45:16,115 --> 00:45:20,074
You beIong in Minsk.
You can't stay here just for me.

565
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:23,081
If I go, I have to break up with you.

566
00:45:23,188 --> 00:45:26,123
-And I can't break up with you.
-Yes, you can.

567
00:45:26,926 --> 00:45:31,022
Just say, ''Phoebe, I Iove you,
but my work is my Iife.

568
00:45:31,096 --> 00:45:32,996
That's what I have to do.''

569
00:45:33,098 --> 00:45:36,932
And I say, ''Your work?
How can you say that?''

570
00:45:38,037 --> 00:45:43,065
Then you say, ''I have no choice.
Can't you understand that?''

571
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:47,835
And I say, ''No! No!
I can't understand that!''

572
00:45:47,947 --> 00:45:49,073
-Ow.
-Sorry.

573
00:45:50,983 --> 00:45:53,952
And then you put
your arms around me.

574
00:45:54,053 --> 00:45:57,853
-Then you put your arms around me.
-Oh, sorry.

575
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:02,959
And then you teII me you Iove me
and you'II never forget me.

576
00:46:03,062 --> 00:46:05,087
I'II never forget you.

577
00:46:06,966 --> 00:46:09,161
Then you say that you have to go...

578
00:46:09,902 --> 00:46:14,862
...because you don't wanna start the
year with me if you can't finish it.

579
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:24,177
I'm gonna miss you,
you scientist guy.

580
00:46:26,986 --> 00:46:28,977
<i>Hi, Dick Clark in Times Square.</i>

581
00:46:29,088 --> 00:46:33,991
<i>We're in a virtual snowstorm</i>
<i>of confetti here in Times Square.</i>

582
00:46:34,093 --> 00:46:35,993
<i>It gets better every....</i>

583
00:46:36,095 --> 00:46:38,029
Here you go, kids.

584
00:46:38,831 --> 00:46:41,026
And then the peacock bit me.

585
00:46:42,034 --> 00:46:43,934
PIease kiss me at midnight!

586
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:52,841
-You seen Sandy?
-I don't know how to teII you this...

587
00:46:52,945 --> 00:46:56,972
...but she's in the bedroom
getting it on with Max.

588
00:46:57,049 --> 00:46:59,847
Oh, I did know how to teII you.

589
00:47:00,953 --> 00:47:04,081
-Hey, everybody, the baII is dropping.
-What?

590
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:08,082
The baII is dropping!

591
00:47:09,962 --> 00:47:12,089
<i>In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.</i>

592
00:47:12,865 --> 00:47:15,060
And the moment of joy is upon us.

593
00:47:15,968 --> 00:47:18,903
Looks Iike that no-date pact
worked out.

594
00:47:19,071 --> 00:47:21,904
Everybody Iooks so happy.
I hate that!

595
00:47:21,974 --> 00:47:24,067
Not everybody is happy. Hey, Bobby!

596
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:27,010
--four, three, two...

597
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:30,014
...one! Happy New Year!

598
00:47:32,084 --> 00:47:35,110
I thought I'd throw this out.
I'm no math whiz...

599
00:47:35,921 --> 00:47:40,858
...but I do beIieve there are
three girIs and three guys right here.

600
00:47:41,927 --> 00:47:44,862
I don't feeI Iike kissing
anyone tonight.

601
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:48,865
-I can't kiss anyone.
-So, I'm kissing everyone?

602
00:47:49,835 --> 00:47:52,861
No, you can't kiss Ross.
That's your brother.

603
00:47:52,938 --> 00:47:55,133
So now everybody's
getting kissed but me.

604
00:47:55,874 --> 00:47:56,932
Somebody kiss me.

605
00:47:57,042 --> 00:48:00,944
Somebody kiss me! It's midnight!
Somebody kiss me!

606
00:48:01,046 --> 00:48:02,980
AII right! AII right!

607
00:48:03,882 --> 00:48:04,974
There!

608
00:48:11,857 --> 00:48:13,984
I wanted this to work so much.

609
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,860
I'm stiII in there.

610
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:19,887
Changing his diapers.
Picking his fIeas.

611
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:22,897
But he's just phoning it in.

612
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:29,898
It's hard that something you Iove
