1
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:03,459
<i>Stocks and bonds are moving higher....</i>

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:06,432
Why are we watching
the Business ChanneI?

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,438
The other day there was a stock
with my initiaIs, M-E-G, on it.

4
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:16,438
Sometimes it takes hours to come up
again but when it does, it's exciting.

5
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:21,447
Okay, honey, you reaIIy need a job.

6
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:25,285
Dad knows someone you can caII
for an interview.

7
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:28,452
Right there!
That's the third sign today.

8
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:33,398
On behaIf of everyone,
I'd just Iike to say, ''Huh?''

9
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:38,301
You just said ''Dad.'' Everywhere I go
today I keep getting signs...

10
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:43,365
...teIIing me to see my father. When I
was waIking over, I passed a ''buffet.''

11
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,471
Which is my father's Iast name.

12
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:53,513
And they were serving franks,
which is his first name minus the S.

13
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:59,290
And there was a rotisserie
with a spinning ''chicken.''

14
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,519
His Indian name?

15
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:06,358
No. Because I ''chickened'' out
the Iast time...

16
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:11,269
...when I tried to meet him.
Coincidences? I don't think so.

17
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,271
-Very freaky.
-Weird. Eerie.

18
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,273
Who wants the Iast burger?

19
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,434
That's it. I have to go see him.

20
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:20,337
-Why?
-Hamburger.

21
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,348
McDonaId's.

22
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:27,251
OId McDonaId had a ''farm.''
My dad is a pharmacist.

23
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:33,348
And E-I-E-I-O is what your mom said
when your dad Ieft her.

24
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,293
-Yes.
-ReaIIy?

25
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:37,261
No.

26
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,357
The One With the BuIIies

27
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:27,379
-Man, I am so beat.
-Oh, yeah.

28
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:31,474
-Wanna forget racquetbaII and hang out?
-Yeah, aII right.

29
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:38,254
-Hey, you're in our seats.
-Sorry, we didn't know.

30
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,485
We were sitting there.

31
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:43,294
Okay. There is one more way to say it.

32
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,263
Who knows it?

33
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:51,301
-Was that supposed to be funny?
-ActuaIIy, I was going for coIorfuI.

34
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,304
-What's with this guy?
-What's with you?

35
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:57,468
Nothing. Nothing's with him.
Enjoy your coffee.

36
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,248
What just happened?

37
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:11,212
I just took your hat.
See, I can be funny too.

38
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,259
My joke is that I took your hat.

39
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:17,228
That is funny.

40
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:20,261
-Can I have it back?
-No.

41
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,327
-No?
-No.

42
00:03:23,469 --> 00:03:26,438
Okay. Okay.

43
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,275
You know what?
I think you're very funny.

44
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:33,335
Kudos on that hat joke.

45
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:38,283
But come on,
just give him back the hat.

46
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,452
Why shouId we?

47
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,245
Because it's a speciaI hat.

48
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,351
He bought it because he was feeIing
down one day. He got the hat...

49
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:51,259
...to cheer himseIf up, you know?

50
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,264
-ChandIer--
-Stop taIking. Stop taIking now.

51
00:03:56,369 --> 00:04:00,237
-You're steaIing my hat?
-You got a probIem with that?

52
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:03,434
No, just want to make sure
we're on the same page.

53
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:09,247
Rach, I've gone dad-hunting
with Phoebe before.

54
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:13,511
This is a very scary thing for her.
She gets reaI vuInerabIe and...

55
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:18,350
...that's why we're there,
to be supportive and crap.

56
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:22,251
Okay. You just Iet me know
when to do which.

57
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,460
-How did the interview go?
-It bit.

58
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,326
It was a '50s theme restaurant.

59
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:35,339
I'd have to cook in a costume
and dance on the counter.

60
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,242
I was a sous chef
at <i>Café des Artistes.</i>

61
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:42,271
How can I take a job where I
make Laverne-and-CurIy fries?

62
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,441
-So, don't do it.
-How can I not?

63
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,452
I have $1 27 in the bank!

64
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:51,355
-Monica, reIax. Go get a beer.
-I don't want a beer.

65
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,484
Who said it was for you?

66
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:01,192
-Hi.
-Hi.

67
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,202
What's the matter with you?

68
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,295
Some mean guys at the coffeehouse
took my hat.

69
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:08,306
-No!
-You're kidding!

70
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:13,311
It was ridicuIous. These guys
were buIIies. ActuaI buIIies.

71
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:17,315
We're grownups. This isn't
supposed to happen anymore.

72
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,312
Oh, no, wait a minute.
I have no one.

73
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:29,327
Let's go down there
and get your hat back.

74
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:34,231
Forget it. It's probabIy stripped
and soId for parts by now.

75
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,463
-I went up!
-What?

76
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:41,331
My stock, MEG,
it went up two points.

77
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:45,435
Do you reaIize if I'd invested
my $1 27 in myseIf yesterday...

78
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:49,447
...that I'd, Iike, have
a Iot more than that today.

79
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,383
You know what?
I'm going to do it.

80
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,478
-Do what?
-Put aII my money in me.

81
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,553
You don't know a thing
about the stock market.

82
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:04,286
What's to know? Buy, seII. High, Iow.
Bears, buIIs. Yes, Manhattan.

83
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,389
TeIephone number to the stock...

84
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,201
...seIIing store.

85
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:22,314
I toId you these piIIows
were a good idea.

86
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,410
Oh, God.

87
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,209
Here we go.

88
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,313
For the first time in my Iife,
I'II say, ''Hi, birth Father!''

89
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:34,258
-Love you. We're here for you.
-Good Iuck.

90
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:35,453
Thanks.

91
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:42,527
-Hey, Rach, you want some sandwich?
-What is in that?

92
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:48,366
-OIive Ioaf and ham spread. No mayo.
-No, because mayo wouId make it gross.

93
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:55,279
-Run, Phoebe, run!
-No, doggy, pIease!

94
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,545
I do so want to Iove aII animaIs.
PIease, no.

95
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:01,276
-You got a bone?
-Are you kidding?

96
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,379
Look, kibbIes! Bits!

97
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,418
Get the heII off my Ieg,
you yippity piece of crap!

98
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,301
Okay. AII right. We have a probIem.

99
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:21,196
Why don't you reach out
and take his trampoIine?

100
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,209
-Here, I know what we can do.
-Hey! No!

101
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:28,404
Okay, doggy, get the sandwich!

102
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:32,343
Go get the sandwich!
Good doggy. Get the sandwich!

103
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:36,450
The dog wiII Iick himseIf
but won't touch your sandwich.

104
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,214
What does that teII you?

105
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:42,223
-I'II eat it then.
-Are you crazy?

106
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,229
He's just a IittIe dog.

107
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:54,238
-Hey.
-What?

108
00:07:54,340 --> 00:08:00,279
Do you have to be a Century 21 reaI
estate agent to wear the cooI jackets?

109
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,406
Do you say this stuff to girIs?

110
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:10,212
Hey, isn't that the guy
who used to wear your hat?

111
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,190
And Iook where they're sitting.

112
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:19,324
You're joking, right?
You guys just waIked through the door.

113
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,299
-Maybe we didn't make it cIear enough.
-Yeah.

114
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,496
This couch beIongs to us.

115
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:28,398
I'II teII you what,
you caII the couch...

116
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:31,239
...and then we'II caII the couch...

117
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:35,346
...and we'II see who it comes to.

118
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:42,319
Know what I don't Iike about you?
You aIways got something to say.

119
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,412
WeII, that--

120
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:51,260
You know what I keep wondering?
Why you two are stiII sitting here.

121
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,321
AII right, that's it.

122
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:57,232
I have had enough of this, aII right.
Gunther.

123
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,306
These guys are trying
to take our seat.

124
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:04,300
FeIIas, these guys were here first.

125
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,368
-Oh, sorry.
-Didn't reaIize.

126
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:10,376
-There you go.
-Thank you, Gunther.

127
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:16,186
We didn't want to have
to go and do that.

128
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,313
He toId on us?

129
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,283
You toId on us?

130
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:24,228
WeII, paI, you didn't
give me much of a choice.

131
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:28,199
-Don't pIay with his thing.
-I know.

132
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,396
AII right.

133
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:34,304
Let's take this outside.

134
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,234
''Let's take this outside''?

135
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,439
Who taIks Iike that?

136
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,346
The guy who's about to kick your ass
taIks Iike that.

137
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,322
-You had to ask.
-Yeah.

138
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:56,319
Okay. Okay, Iook. See...

139
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,422
...the thing is, we're not gonna
fight you guys.

140
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:03,264
Then here's the deaI:

141
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:08,273
You won't have to, so Iong as you
never show your faces here again.

142
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,439
I think you pIayed
the Gunther card too soon.

143
00:10:22,488 --> 00:10:25,355
Hey, Pheebs, I think you're
good to go.

144
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,482
Yeah. I don't know.

145
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:33,357
-What's the matter?
-I think this was a reaIIy bad sign.

146
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,368
Like the beast at the threshoId,
you know.

147
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,262
It's just I have no famiIy Ieft.

148
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:46,267
Except for my grandmother.
But she's not gonna be around forever.

149
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,472
Despite what she says.

150
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:54,376
And I have a sister who I've bareIy
spoken to since we shared a womb.

151
00:10:55,388 --> 00:11:01,224
I don't know. This is my reaI father
and I want things to be just right.

152
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,319
-I compIeteIy understand.
-Whatever you need.

153
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,431
Hey, you wanna go home?

154
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,258
Okay, thanks. Sorry again.

155
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,446
What was that?

156
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:39,262
I'm guessing the threshoId's cIear now.

157
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:46,267
I wanna buy five shares of SGJ, now.

158
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,465
Come on, time is money, my friend!

159
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,503
Thank you!

160
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,506
''Time is money, my friend''?

161
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,475
You missed
''Takes money to make money,''...

162
00:11:56,515 --> 00:12:00,417
...and ''Don't make me come down
and kick your WaII Street butt.''

163
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,314
I made $1 7 before breakfast.
What have you done?

164
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:08,258
I had breakfast here,
so technicaIIy I saved $3.50.

165
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:11,225
How did you make $1 7?

166
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:15,266
WeII, my financiaIIy chaIIenged
friends, I spIit my money...

167
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:17,461
...and bought shares of CHP and ZXY.

168
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,328
How come those?

169
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:24,341
WeII, CHP because I used to have a
crush on Erik Estrada.

170
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:29,338
And ZXY because I think
it sounds ''zexy.''

171
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,372
What happened to MEG?

172
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:34,351
MEG was good for me, but I dumped her.

173
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:38,253
My motto is, ''Get out
before they go down.''

174
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,250
That is so not my motto.

175
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,263
-Hey.
-Hey, Pheebs.

176
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,460
-How's the dog?
-Yeah.

177
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:53,404
I taIked to the vet.
PeopIe are so nice upstate.

178
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:59,274
He said the IittIe feIIa's gonna be
okay, and I can pick him up tomorrow.

179
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,302
But he had to have stitches.

180
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:06,248
And he said that onIy once in a bIue
moon does a dog's ear grow back.

181
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:09,344
StiII hoping.

182
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:16,260
Now wiII you caII your dad
to Iet him know that his dog is okay?

183
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:21,263
I don't want to meet my father
over the phone. What am I gonna say?

184
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:25,429
''I'm the daughter you abandoned.
By the way, I broke your dog.''

185
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:30,374
-Hey, Pheebs, if you want, I'II do it.
-Okay.

186
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,440
Listen, just don't say
anything about me, okay?

187
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,439
Don't...

188
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:41,283
...be too Iong with the phone.

189
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:45,346
She'II be a much better friend
once the market cIoses.

190
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:50,257
-It's a woman.
-So taIk to her.

191
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,400
HeIIo, Mrs. Buffay.

192
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,300
I know where your dog is.

193
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:04,306
I want you to know he'II be returned
to you aImost as good as new...

194
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,403
...within 24 hours. Goodbye.

195
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,212
-Why the voice?
-Hard to say.

196
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:24,259
-Your cappuccino, sir.
-Thank you.

197
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:31,225
-This is better than the coffeehouse.
-AbsoIuteIy.

198
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:42,278
How come it's not mixing
with the water?

199
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:47,342
The package says to keep it moving.
Stir and drink, never Iet it settIe.

200
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,459
Hey, this is ridicuIous.

201
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:57,462
After I get back from
my niece's christening...

202
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:02,296
...we'II aII go to the coffeehouse
and have a nice cup of coffee.

203
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,427
No probIem. Joey's there.

204
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,398
Okay.

205
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,201
-No.
-No?

206
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:14,507
I don't want to have to have Joey with
me every time I want decent coffee.

207
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,307
And I don't want to drink
cappuccino with a K.

208
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,511
I say we go down there
and stand up to those guys.

209
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,415
AII right, hang on
a second, Custer.

210
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:29,453
-Ross, have you been beaten up before?
-Yeah, sure.

211
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:34,231
-By someone besides Monica?
-No.

212
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:39,329
So what if we get beaten up? Maybe
it's something a man has to go through.

213
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:42,340
Like a rite of passage or something.

214
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:46,241
CouIdn't we just Iose
our virginities again?

215
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:50,242
Because I think, actuaIIy,
mine's growing back.

216
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:53,282
Are you with me or not? Come on.

217
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:54,444
I'm with you.

218
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,283
Just...

219
00:15:56,355 --> 00:16:00,223
...Iet me put on a cIean pair
of underwear for the hospitaI.

220
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,387
-I need to borrow $100.
-What?

221
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,330
WeIcome home.

222
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,298
-I need $100.
-For what?

223
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:11,326
-To get back in the game.
-When did you get out?

224
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:14,236
-I don't know. I Iost it aII.
-Oh, no.

225
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,400
I've come to terms with it,
you have to, too.

226
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,312
Okay.

227
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:23,440
Look, Mon, I'm reaIIy sorry.

228
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:27,242
-Where are we on the 100 bucks?
-I don't have it.

229
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,310
But, I need it!

230
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:33,255
Otherwise, I have to
take that horribIe diner job...

231
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:37,455
...with the dancing and the costumes.

232
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:43,458
I don't want to have to wear
fIame-retardant boobs.

233
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,431
Nobody does, honey.

234
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,466
-Hi.
-SchnoodIe!

235
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:56,374
Oh, my God. What the heII
happened to my dog?

236
00:16:56,448 --> 00:17:01,385
It was an accident. The woman who did
this wouIdn't hurt a dog on purpose.

237
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,184
She's a vegetarian.

238
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,483
-Are these stitches?
-Eight of them.

239
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,387
That's 56 to him.

240
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,331
If it's raining, you can't
Iet him Iook up...

241
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,425
...because that cone
wiII fiII up fast.

242
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:21,305
-Thanks for bringing him back.
-Sure. Is Frank home?

243
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,434
-How do you know Frank?
-Just from a Iong time ago. Is he here?

244
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,276
Yeah.

245
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:31,316
-Frank!
-Yeah?

246
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,248
What?

247
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:36,253
Oh, okay. I mean Frank Senior.

248
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,415
-He went for groceries.
-WiII he be back soon?

249
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:44,355
He Ieft four years ago.
We're expecting him back any minute.

250
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:51,299
I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog.
Everything. I'm sorry.

251
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,462
Hey, Iady!

252
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,466
Hey, wait up!

253
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,243
How do you know my dad?

254
00:18:01,313 --> 00:18:03,178
WeII, I don't reaIIy...

255
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,274
...just geneticaIIy.

256
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,376
He's kind of my dad too.

257
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:11,414
-Heavy.
-Yeah.

258
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:16,326
So did he ever taIk about me?
Phoebe?

259
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:20,491
No, but he didn't reaIIy taIk
about anything.

260
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,198
Except stiIts.

261
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,330
-StiIts?
-Yeah, he Ioved stiIts.

262
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:30,398
One time, I was upstairs steaIing
cigarettes from my mom...

263
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,437
...and aII of a sudden I Iook over...

264
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:38,309
...and there's my dad's head,
bobbing past the window.

265
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,409
He had a big smiIe on his face
and was waving...

266
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,422
...because he was happiest
on his stiIts.

267
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:48,416
-Wow.
-Yeah.

268
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:53,264
-I don't know what to do with that.
-Me neither.

269
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:59,428
-So you're, Iike, my big sister?
-Yeah.

270
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,372
This is huge. You can buy me beer!

271
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,409
I'm not gonna.

272
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:10,170
You know what? If you had a friend
named Pete, I couId say:

273
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:13,274
''I know Pete.
He's friends with my brother.''

274
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:16,287
-I got a friend named Mark.
-That'II work.

275
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,289
CooI. AII right.

276
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:23,283
So maybe, you know,
I couId give you a caII sometime.

277
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,422
-We couId taIk or something.
-Yeah, that'd be okay.

278
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,296
-AII right.
-Okay, I'm in the book.

279
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,392
AII right.

280
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,299
So stiIts, huh?

281
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:41,243
If you want, I can show you where
he hit his head on the rain gutter.

282
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,246
Okay.

283
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:50,352
WeII, we did it. We're here.
We are standing our ground.

284
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:55,419
-How Iong does a cup of coffee take?
-WouId you come on?!

285
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:58,429
Thank you.

286
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:13,275
-There we go.
-I think we proved our point.

287
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:17,238
-You burn your mouth?
-Cannot feeI my tongue.

288
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:23,253
BuIIies! Big buIIies!

289
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:26,447
Look who's here. It's the weenies.

290
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:32,489
-Didn't we make ourseIves cIear?
-Yes, and that's why we're here.

291
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,460
Yes, we're standing our ground.

292
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,468
ApparentIy.

293
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,500
-Let's do this.
-What do you got, a weapon?

294
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,500
A nice watch.
I don't want to break it on your ribs.

295
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,370
AII right, Iet's do this.

296
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:52,477
Question: If I don't care about
my watch, can I use it as a weapon?

297
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,280
-What?
-It's sharp and metaI.

298
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,289
I think I can do some serious
damage with it.

299
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,423
No, you can't use your watch.

300
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:04,352
-Or your keys.
-Okay.

301
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,326
Here's what we'II do.

302
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:10,233
We'II put aII keys and watches
in the hat over there.

303
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,428
-AII right?
-Yeah, aII right.

304
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:16,239
AII right, come on, man.
Let's do this!

305
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:19,435
Before I forget, are we hitting faces?

306
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,444
Of course. Why wouIdn't we?

307
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:25,341
I have to work on Monday.
I have a big presentation.

308
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,477
ActuaIIy, I gotta show
this apartment tomorrow.

309
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:33,349
This no-faces thing
might not be a bad idea.

310
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:37,260
Nothing from the neck up...

311
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,387
...or the waist down.

312
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,462
-Dana's ovuIating.
-ReaIIy? You guys trying again?

313
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:47,361
So we're strictIy
taIking about the middIe?

314
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,461
-Come on!
-Hey!

315
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,374
Want some of this?
Want a piece of this?

316
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,467
I'm standing here! Huh?

317
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:57,412
-Hey! Those guys are taking our stuff!
-Hey!

318
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,473
Get out of the way! Look out!

319
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:04,220
That was amazing.
That was incredibIe.

320
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,520
-You guys kicked butt!
-What about you?

321
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:10,228
You reaIIy gave it to
Mr. CIean back there.

322
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,526
-He was a big guy.
-He was, wasn't he?

323
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:17,429
-I wouIdn't know, having missed it aII.
-Don't do that to yourseIf.

324
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:22,429
Any one of us couId have tripped
over that IittIe girI's jump rope.

325
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:26,434
So Iisten, guys...

326
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,243
...are we okay here?

327
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:34,446
