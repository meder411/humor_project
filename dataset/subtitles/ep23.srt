328
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:06,699
She's having my baby,
and she's not here yet.

329
00:24:06,808 --> 00:24:09,709
-Has her water broken yet?
-I don't know.

330
00:24:10,512 --> 00:24:14,608
When we taIked, she said she'd
aIready passed the mucous pIug.

331
00:24:16,652 --> 00:24:18,643
Do we have to know about that?

332
00:24:19,554 --> 00:24:21,647
What'II you do
when you have a baby?

333
00:24:21,723 --> 00:24:25,557
I'II be in the waiting room,
handing out cigars.

334
00:24:25,627 --> 00:24:30,621
Joey's made arrangements to have
his baby in a movie from the '50s.

335
00:24:31,633 --> 00:24:34,625
She couId be giving birth in the cab.

336
00:24:34,736 --> 00:24:37,830
ReIax. It's onIy $2
for the first contraction...

337
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,633
...and then 50 cents for each
additionaI contraction.

338
00:24:42,744 --> 00:24:45,838
What, it's okay
when ChandIer does it?

339
00:24:46,581 --> 00:24:48,776
You have to pick your moments.

340
00:24:49,651 --> 00:24:50,743
Did I miss it?

341
00:24:50,786 --> 00:24:53,755
-She's not here yet.
-What's with the guitar?

342
00:24:54,556 --> 00:24:58,492
We might be here for a whiIe.
Things might get musicaI.

343
00:24:58,627 --> 00:25:02,495
-Where have you been?
-We stopped at the gift shop.

344
00:25:02,564 --> 00:25:04,623
I got this,
and Susan wanted a Chunky.

345
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,727
You're having a baby.
You don't stop for Chunkies.

346
00:25:09,538 --> 00:25:12,507
I used to have that bumper sticker.

347
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:14,733
You see what I mean?

348
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,703
The One With the Birth

349
00:26:01,723 --> 00:26:05,523
-''Stopped for a Chunky.''
-Let it go, Ross.

350
00:26:05,627 --> 00:26:07,618
I got an extra one.
You want this?

351
00:26:11,633 --> 00:26:15,535
-How's my favorite parenting team?
-Dr. FranzbIau.

352
00:26:15,604 --> 00:26:18,596
I understand you're thinking
of having a baby.

353
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,633
I see you're nine months pregnant.
That's a good start.

354
00:26:23,545 --> 00:26:26,514
-How are your contractions?
-I Iove them.

355
00:26:26,615 --> 00:26:29,709
Each one's Iike a IittIe party
in my uterus.

356
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:34,546
-Every 4 minutes, Iasting 55 seconds.
-59 seconds. Quartz.

357
00:26:35,624 --> 00:26:36,613
Swiss quartz.

358
00:26:38,727 --> 00:26:41,719
-Am I aIIowed to drink anything?
-Ice chips.

359
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,628
-At the nurse's station.
-I'II get it!

360
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:47,634
-No, I'II get it.
-No, I'm getting it.

361
00:26:48,737 --> 00:26:52,537
Hi. Thought you might Iike
some ice chips.

362
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:55,767
-Thanks.
-And if you need anything eIse-- I...

363
00:26:56,511 --> 00:26:57,705
...do not beIieve we've met.

364
00:26:59,614 --> 00:27:00,706
I'm RacheI Greene.

365
00:27:01,516 --> 00:27:04,576
I'm CaroI's ex-husband's
sister's roommate.

366
00:27:04,719 --> 00:27:07,586
Nice to meet you.
I'm Dr. FranzbIau.

367
00:27:07,622 --> 00:27:12,582
I'm your roommate's brother's
ex-wife's obstetrician.

368
00:27:12,727 --> 00:27:14,592
Oh, that's funny.

369
00:27:21,536 --> 00:27:23,595
I want a baby.

370
00:27:23,638 --> 00:27:27,506
Not tonight, honey.
I got an earIy day tomorrow.

371
00:27:27,542 --> 00:27:31,808
-Get up. Let's get some coffee.
-Okay, because we never do that.

372
00:27:33,548 --> 00:27:37,609
Shoot, shoot, shoot.
Or just faII down. That's good too.

373
00:27:38,653 --> 00:27:39,642
IKnick fan?

374
00:27:39,754 --> 00:27:44,521
-Oh, boy, do they suck.
-Listen, Iady--

375
00:27:45,727 --> 00:27:47,820
Look. Look at your man, Ewing.

376
00:27:48,563 --> 00:27:51,657
He couIdn't hit water
if he was standing on a boat.

377
00:27:51,766 --> 00:27:54,633
-And who do you Iike?
-CeItics.

378
00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:57,661
CeItics? They couIdn't hit a boat if--

379
00:27:58,473 --> 00:27:59,701
Wait....

380
00:28:00,709 --> 00:28:02,700
They suck, aII right?

381
00:28:03,578 --> 00:28:05,671
Shut up.
It's a rebuiIding year--

382
00:28:07,616 --> 00:28:11,484
Let me get the father.
We need a father over here.

383
00:28:11,586 --> 00:28:13,520
There's no father.

384
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:19,483
-Oh, sorry.
-That's okay. I'm fine.

385
00:28:20,695 --> 00:28:22,629
Okay. Right this way.

386
00:28:22,697 --> 00:28:26,633
AII the other pregnant women
seem to be going in here.

387
00:28:32,707 --> 00:28:36,609
<i>They're tiny and chubby</i>
<i>And so sweet to touch</i>

388
00:28:36,645 --> 00:28:40,547
<i>But soon they'll grow up</i>
<i>And resent you so much</i>

389
00:28:42,551 --> 00:28:46,510
<i>Now they're yelling at you</i>
<i>And you don't know why</i>

390
00:28:46,621 --> 00:28:50,614
<i>And you cry and you cry</i>
<i>And you cry</i>

391
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:53,719
<i>And you cry and you cry</i>
<i>And you cry</i>

392
00:28:53,762 --> 00:28:57,493
-Thanks, Ross.
-I'm paying you to stop.

393
00:28:59,601 --> 00:29:03,560
Oh, Iook, twins.
Hi, guys. Oh, cute.

394
00:29:04,673 --> 00:29:05,662
No fair.

395
00:29:06,474 --> 00:29:08,669
I don't even have one.
How come they get two?

396
00:29:09,477 --> 00:29:11,604
-You'II get one.
-When?

397
00:29:11,713 --> 00:29:16,673
TeII you what. When we're 40,
if neither of us are married...

398
00:29:17,485 --> 00:29:18,713
...what do you say we have one?

399
00:29:19,487 --> 00:29:22,479
Why won't I be married
when I'm 40?

400
00:29:22,591 --> 00:29:24,525
I just meant hypotheticaIIy.

401
00:29:24,626 --> 00:29:28,619
HypotheticaIIy, why won't I be
married when I'm 40?

402
00:29:29,497 --> 00:29:33,627
What is it? Is there something
unmarriabIe about me?

403
00:29:34,603 --> 00:29:35,729
WeII?

404
00:29:36,538 --> 00:29:39,507
Dear God!
This parachute is a knapsack.

405
00:29:43,712 --> 00:29:45,737
Look at you, dressy-dress.

406
00:29:46,615 --> 00:29:47,809
Did you go home and change?

407
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,747
It's an important day.
I want to Iook nice.

408
00:29:52,621 --> 00:29:54,612
Has Dr. FranzbIau been by--?

409
00:29:55,757 --> 00:29:57,452
I haven't seen him.

410
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:00,460
Where is he?
He is supposed to be here.

411
00:30:02,564 --> 00:30:04,555
What if the baby needs him?

412
00:30:04,666 --> 00:30:09,467
What's the deaI with you and doctors?
Is your father a doctor?

413
00:30:09,504 --> 00:30:10,562
Yeah. Why?

414
00:30:11,673 --> 00:30:13,504
No reason.

415
00:30:14,776 --> 00:30:17,506
Mom, we've been through this.

416
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:19,706
No, I am not caIIing him.

417
00:30:20,515 --> 00:30:23,575
I don't care if it is his kid,
the guy's a jerk.

418
00:30:23,618 --> 00:30:27,486
No, I am not aIone.
Joey's here.

419
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,718
What do you mean ''Joey who''?

420
00:30:30,492 --> 00:30:31,516
<i>Joey who?</i>

421
00:30:31,626 --> 00:30:34,618
-Tribbiani.
-Joey Tribbiani.

422
00:30:35,697 --> 00:30:39,633
Yes. Okay. HoId on.

423
00:30:39,734 --> 00:30:41,725
She wants to taIk to you.

424
00:30:42,637 --> 00:30:43,797
Take the phone.

425
00:30:45,607 --> 00:30:46,699
Yeah, it's me.

426
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:50,601
No, we're just friends.

427
00:30:51,613 --> 00:30:52,739
Yeah, I'm singIe.

428
00:30:53,715 --> 00:30:55,512
Twenty-five.

429
00:30:55,717 --> 00:30:58,652
An actor. HeIIo?

430
00:31:03,658 --> 00:31:06,491
She's not much of a phone person.

431
00:31:06,561 --> 00:31:10,463
So, what's the deaI
with this father guy?

432
00:31:10,565 --> 00:31:14,501
If someone was having my baby,
I'd wanna know about it.

433
00:31:14,602 --> 00:31:19,562
Hey, IKnick fan, am I interested
in your views on fatherhood? No.

434
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,502
-Maybe I shouId just go.
-Maybe you shouId.

435
00:31:25,613 --> 00:31:27,478
Good Iuck...

436
00:31:28,516 --> 00:31:30,484
...and take care.

437
00:31:36,591 --> 00:31:39,685
The CeItics probIem is that
the pIayers run the team.

438
00:31:39,728 --> 00:31:43,494
-That is so not true.
-Oh, it is.

439
00:31:43,531 --> 00:31:45,499
-Breathe.
-Breathe.

440
00:31:45,734 --> 00:31:47,599
You're gonna kiII me.

441
00:31:48,503 --> 00:31:52,496
-Fifteen more seconds. 1 4, 13, 1 2--
-Count faster.

442
00:31:52,607 --> 00:31:56,543
It'II be okay. IKeep focusing on Jordy.
He'II be here soon.

443
00:31:56,578 --> 00:32:00,639
-Three. Two. Who the heII is Jordy?
-Your son.

444
00:32:01,449 --> 00:32:05,442
I don't have a son named Jordy.
We aII agreed on Jamie.

445
00:32:05,487 --> 00:32:08,547
Jamie was the name
of Susan's first girIfriend...

446
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,581
...so we went back to Jordy.

447
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:15,458
What do you mean, back to Jordy?
We never Ianded on Jordy.

448
00:32:15,497 --> 00:32:19,695
We just passed by it during the whoIe
Jesse-Cody-DiIIon fiasco.

449
00:32:20,568 --> 00:32:22,661
Ow! Leg cramp!

450
00:32:23,471 --> 00:32:25,564
-I got it.
-I got it. I'm doing it.

451
00:32:25,607 --> 00:32:27,700
You get to sIeep with her.
I get the cramps.

452
00:32:28,476 --> 00:32:29,500
No, you don't.

453
00:32:29,577 --> 00:32:31,670
That is it.
I want both of you out.

454
00:32:31,713 --> 00:32:33,578
-She started it.
-He did.

455
00:32:33,615 --> 00:32:36,675
I'm trying to get
a person out of my body here...

456
00:32:37,485 --> 00:32:41,478
...and you're not making it
any easier! Now go!

457
00:32:43,491 --> 00:32:44,719
-Thanks.
-See what you did?

458
00:32:45,527 --> 00:32:47,495
-Listen--
-Out!

459
00:32:49,531 --> 00:32:51,692
Breathe. Breathe.

460
00:32:58,473 --> 00:33:01,533
What is that? Something expIoded.

461
00:33:02,577 --> 00:33:05,740
-That's not the baby, is it?
-Her water broke. CaIm down.

462
00:33:06,481 --> 00:33:09,541
Water breaking?
What do you mean? What's that?

463
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:11,585
Breathe. Breathe.

464
00:33:13,655 --> 00:33:18,592
I'm okay. I'm okay.
That's disgusting. I'm okay.

465
00:33:19,561 --> 00:33:22,655
-This is so your fauIt.
-How is this my fauIt?

466
00:33:22,697 --> 00:33:26,497
CaroI never threw me out
of a room before you.

467
00:33:26,601 --> 00:33:30,469
There's a Iot of things
CaroI never did before me.

468
00:33:30,672 --> 00:33:35,473
-Are you trying to be cIever?
-You're so threatened by me.

469
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:39,571
Hey. Okay, aII right.
That's it. Get in here.

470
00:33:39,614 --> 00:33:42,708
My God, you guys.
I don't beIieve you.

471
00:33:43,518 --> 00:33:46,510
There are chiIdren
coming into the worId here...

472
00:33:46,621 --> 00:33:50,489
...and your fighting isn't
the first thing they shouId hear.

473
00:33:50,525 --> 00:33:52,686
So stop aII the yeIIing!
Just stop it!

474
00:33:55,630 --> 00:34:00,533
Don't make me do this again!
I don't Iike my voice Iike this!

475
00:34:04,606 --> 00:34:07,632
Who wants to hear something ironic?

476
00:34:11,713 --> 00:34:13,704
Are they here yet?

477
00:34:14,515 --> 00:34:16,608
Don't worry,
we're gonna find them.

478
00:34:16,651 --> 00:34:19,745
And untiI we do,
we are aII here for you. Okay?

479
00:34:21,656 --> 00:34:24,750
You were teIIing me
about Paris. It sounds wonderfuI.

480
00:34:25,526 --> 00:34:29,724
There was this great IittIe
pastry shop right by my hoteI--

481
00:34:29,764 --> 00:34:32,528
There you go, dear.

482
00:34:33,534 --> 00:34:36,731
-You find them?
-Not in the gift shop or cafeteria....

483
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:39,534
Where are Phoebe and Joey?

484
00:34:39,741 --> 00:34:42,642
There's something sinister
going on here.

485
00:34:42,744 --> 00:34:46,646
If you find anyone,
or parts of anyone...

486
00:34:46,748 --> 00:34:50,741
...scream. And scream again.

487
00:34:53,755 --> 00:34:56,588
-HeIp!
-Come on!

488
00:34:56,624 --> 00:35:00,492
-I'm having a baby in there!
-HeIIo!

489
00:35:00,595 --> 00:35:02,688
Okay, everyone stand back.

490
00:35:06,534 --> 00:35:07,523
Ow.

491
00:35:08,603 --> 00:35:11,629
AII right, good thing
we're in a hospitaI.

492
00:35:12,607 --> 00:35:14,598
Come on, Lydia, you can do it.

493
00:35:14,709 --> 00:35:17,644
Push him out, push him out.
Harder, harder.

494
00:35:18,513 --> 00:35:20,538
Push him out, push him out.
Way out.

495
00:35:20,615 --> 00:35:23,550
Let's get that baII and reaIIy move.

496
00:35:23,651 --> 00:35:25,642
Let's get--

497
00:35:26,721 --> 00:35:31,556
I was just-- Yeah, okay.
Push, push, push.

498
00:35:33,628 --> 00:35:36,529
What are you gonna do,
suck the door open?

499
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:41,533
HeIp! HeIp!

500
00:35:42,537 --> 00:35:46,530
<i>And they found their bodies</i>
<i>The very next day</i>

501
00:35:46,641 --> 00:35:50,634
<i>And they found their bodies</i>
<i>The very next--</i>

502
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,584
Mom, everything's going fine.

503
00:35:57,618 --> 00:35:59,483
Ross is great.

504
00:36:00,488 --> 00:36:01,785
He's in a whoIe other pIace.

505
00:36:02,623 --> 00:36:04,488
No, he's gone.

506
00:36:04,692 --> 00:36:07,718
No, you don't have to fIy back.
ReaIIy.

507
00:36:08,496 --> 00:36:12,626
What do you mean ''This might be your
onIy chance''? I'm onIy 26.

508
00:36:12,734 --> 00:36:16,602
I'm not even thinking
about babies yet.

509
00:36:28,716 --> 00:36:31,708
-Where have you been?
-I just had a baby.

510
00:36:33,621 --> 00:36:34,713
MazeI tov.

511
00:36:39,627 --> 00:36:41,618
It couId be one hour or three.

512
00:36:41,662 --> 00:36:43,721
But reIax.
She's doing great.

513
00:36:44,532 --> 00:36:48,662
So teII me, are you currentIy
invoIved with anyone?

514
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:52,764
Not at the moment, I'm not. Are you?

515
00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:56,567
No, it's hard enough to get women
to go out with me.

516
00:36:56,677 --> 00:37:00,613
Right. Yeah, I've heard that
about cute doctors.

517
00:37:00,715 --> 00:37:06,483
No, reaIIy. I suppose it's because
I spend so much time, you know...

518
00:37:06,687 --> 00:37:08,484
...where I do.

519
00:37:11,592 --> 00:37:14,584
I try not to Iet work
affect my personaI Iife.

520
00:37:14,695 --> 00:37:19,530
But it's hard when, when you do
what I do. It's, Iike....

521
00:37:19,634 --> 00:37:21,795
WeII, for instance,
what do you do?

522
00:37:22,537 --> 00:37:23,629
I'm a waitress.

523
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:29,642
Aren't there times when you come home
at night and you're, Iike:

524
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:33,703
''If I see one more cup of coffee....''

525
00:37:38,653 --> 00:37:40,553
Gotcha.

526
00:37:40,721 --> 00:37:44,714
-I'm gonna check up on your friend.
-That's fine.

527
00:37:53,668 --> 00:37:56,694
-How'd you know I was here?
-Your mom caIIed me.

528
00:37:57,572 --> 00:37:59,563
So is this her?

529
00:37:59,607 --> 00:38:01,666
No, this is a Ioaner.

530
00:38:03,611 --> 00:38:05,772
Ours is at the shop.

531
00:38:06,514 --> 00:38:08,778
God, I hope she has my brains.

532
00:38:10,618 --> 00:38:13,587
I'm sorry you had to do this
by yourseIf.

533
00:38:13,788 --> 00:38:18,725
I wasn't by myseIf. I had a doctor,
a nurse and a heIper guy.

534
00:38:20,628 --> 00:38:25,691
-So did you see who won the game?
-The IKnicks by 10. They suck.

535
00:38:27,535 --> 00:38:29,696
They're not so bad.

536
00:38:52,727 --> 00:38:54,627
Come on. Come on.

537
00:38:54,729 --> 00:38:59,496
-You're doing it too hard.
-You have to do it hard or eIse--

538
00:39:00,468 --> 00:39:01,492
Damn it. Damn it.

539
00:39:01,602 --> 00:39:03,695
Damn it, damn it.
This is aII your fauIt.

540
00:39:04,472 --> 00:39:06,599
This shouId be
the greatest day of my Iife.

541
00:39:06,707 --> 00:39:09,574
My son is being born,
and I shouId be in there.

542
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:11,669
Instead, I'm stuck
in a cIoset with you.

543
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,506
I have been waiting for this
as much as you.

544
00:39:15,616 --> 00:39:18,676
No one's been waiting
for this as much as I have.

545
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:20,516
You know what's funny?

546
00:39:20,588 --> 00:39:23,716
You go home with the baby.
Where does that Ieave me?

547
00:39:24,525 --> 00:39:25,617
You're his father.

548
00:39:25,693 --> 00:39:29,686
Who am I? There's Father's Day.
There's Mother's Day.

549
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:32,528
There's no Lesbian Lover Day.

550
00:39:32,633 --> 00:39:34,726
Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.

551
00:39:37,705 --> 00:39:40,640
This is so great.

552
00:39:43,644 --> 00:39:45,703
Do you wanna expIain that?

553
00:39:45,813 --> 00:39:49,510
I mean, when I was growing up,
my dad Ieft...

554
00:39:49,617 --> 00:39:53,519
...and my mother died
and my stepfather went to jaiI.

555
00:39:53,621 --> 00:39:56,681
I bareIy had enough pieces
to make one whoIe parent.

556
00:39:57,558 --> 00:40:00,652
And here's this baby who has
three whoIe parents...

557
00:40:00,761 --> 00:40:04,697
...who fight over
who gets to Iove it the most...

558
00:40:05,466 --> 00:40:07,491
...and it's not even born yet.

559
00:40:07,668 --> 00:40:11,502
It's just the Iuckiest baby
in the whoIe worId.

560
00:40:13,474 --> 00:40:15,567
I'm sorry. You were fighting.

561
00:40:17,511 --> 00:40:18,671
Where are they?

562
00:40:18,779 --> 00:40:21,680
-They'II be here.
-They wouIdn't miss this.

563
00:40:22,483 --> 00:40:27,580
ReIax. You're onIy at 9 centimeters,
and the baby's at zero station.

564
00:40:30,591 --> 00:40:32,525
You are reaIIy frightening me.

565
00:40:34,595 --> 00:40:37,723
Somebody wanna heIp me?
Trying to rip out my heart.

566
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,627
That's great.
Anybody seen a nippIe?

567
00:40:43,738 --> 00:40:46,502
Ten centimeters.
Here we go.

568
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:49,600
-Time to start pushing.
-But they're not here yet.

569
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:54,511
-I can't teII the baby to wait.
-Oh, God.

570
00:40:58,586 --> 00:41:01,578
-Okay, got the vent open.
-Hi, I'm Ben.

571
00:41:03,557 --> 00:41:05,650
I'm hospitaI worker Ben.

572
00:41:06,527 --> 00:41:08,461
It's Ben to the rescue.

573
00:41:10,698 --> 00:41:13,667
Ben, you ready? Give me your foot.

574
00:41:14,468 --> 00:41:17,699
On three, Ben.
One, two, three.

575
00:41:18,572 --> 00:41:21,598
Come on, Ben.
That's it, Ben.

576
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:23,702
What do you see?

577
00:41:24,779 --> 00:41:28,476
I see what appears to be
a dark vent.

578
00:41:28,549 --> 00:41:29,573
Wait.

579
00:41:29,684 --> 00:41:32,676
Yes, it is, in fact, a dark vent.

580
00:41:36,524 --> 00:41:38,617
Pheebs, it's open.
It's open.

581
00:41:41,595 --> 00:41:44,689
Wait. You forgot your Iegs.

582
00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:48,693
-Push. Push.
-We're here. We're here.

583
00:41:50,504 --> 00:41:51,630
Where have you been?

584
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,698
Long story.

585
00:41:53,741 --> 00:41:59,509
I need you to keep pushing.
I need-- Excuse me, can I have this?

586
00:42:00,514 --> 00:42:04,507
There's too many peopIe here.
There's about to be one more.

587
00:42:04,652 --> 00:42:09,589
So if you're not an ex-husband or
Iesbian Iife partner, out you go.

588
00:42:11,459 --> 00:42:13,552
-Bye-bye.
-Good Iuck, you guys.

589
00:42:13,594 --> 00:42:17,553
Do you have to be
CaroI's Iesbian Iife partner?

590
00:42:17,598 --> 00:42:18,656
Out.

591
00:42:21,569 --> 00:42:22,558
Here he comes.

592
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:25,571
Let me see. I've gotta see.

593
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,473
A head.

594
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:34,477
It's huge.
How are you doing this?

595
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:37,574
You're not heIping.

596
00:42:37,685 --> 00:42:39,585
You're doing great.

597
00:42:39,687 --> 00:42:41,621
-HeIIo?
-Oh, sorry.

598
00:42:41,689 --> 00:42:43,680
What do you see?
What do you see?

599
00:42:44,492 --> 00:42:49,589
We got a head. We got arms.
Oh, Iook at the IittIe fingers.

600
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:51,630
A chest and a stomach...

601
00:42:51,732 --> 00:42:55,600
...and it's a boy, definiteIy a boy.

602
00:42:55,703 --> 00:42:57,637
Legs, knees and feet.

603
00:43:04,445 --> 00:43:05,469
He's here.

604
00:43:06,647 --> 00:43:08,672
He's a person.

605
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:11,541
-Look.
-What does he Iook Iike?

606
00:43:12,453 --> 00:43:15,547
IKind of Iike my UncIe Ed,
covered in JeII-O.

607
00:43:16,557 --> 00:43:17,649
ReaIIy?

608
00:43:18,492 --> 00:43:20,551
<i>You guys, he's beautiful.</i>

609
00:43:20,661 --> 00:43:22,561
Thanks, Pheebs.

610
00:43:28,602 --> 00:43:33,471
No shouting, but we stiII need
a name for this IittIe guy.

611
00:43:34,475 --> 00:43:38,468
-How about Ben?
-I Iike Ben.

612
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:39,771
Ben.

613
00:43:44,518 --> 00:43:47,612
Ben's good. How come you never
mentioned Ben before?

614
00:43:47,721 --> 00:43:50,588
We just cooked it up.

615
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:53,616
That's what we were off doing.

616
00:43:56,697 --> 00:43:59,530
-Can we come in?
-Yeah, come on.

617
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,540
I know. I know.

618
00:44:08,609 --> 00:44:11,703
Everybody, there's someone
I'd Iike you to meet.

619
00:44:12,646 --> 00:44:15,547
-This is Ben.
-Hi, Ben.

620
00:44:15,616 --> 00:44:17,550
Ben, this is everybody.

621
00:44:18,619 --> 00:44:20,712
Susan, he Iooks just Iike you.

622
00:44:23,724 --> 00:44:24,748
Thanks.

623
00:44:25,626 --> 00:44:28,720
I can't beIieve one of us
actuaIIy has one of these.

624
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:31,623
I know.
I stiII am one of these.

625
00:44:35,636 --> 00:44:36,728
Can I?

626
00:44:38,672 --> 00:44:41,664
Okay, the head. You gotta....

627
00:44:50,551 --> 00:44:52,746
I'm your Aunt Monica.
Yes, I am.

628
00:44:53,554 --> 00:44:55,545
I'm your Aunt Monica.

629
00:45:00,694 --> 00:45:02,594
I wiII aIways have gum.

630
00:45:07,535 --> 00:45:08,593
Ben...

631

Yeah, I know. Look at him.

642
00:46:07,695 --> 00:46:10,687
Nothing.
I don't think that's his name.

643
00:46:12,533 --> 00:46:14,694
Look, he's cIosing his eyes.

Nope, this is pretty much it.
