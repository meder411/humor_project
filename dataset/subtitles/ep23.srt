1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:05,278
ChandIer, Mon, there's onIy
one muffin Ieft.

2
00:00:05,355 --> 00:00:08,483
-I ordered mine first.
-Yeah, but I'm so much faster.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,385
-Give it to me.
-No.

4
00:00:13,296 --> 00:00:15,264
Give it to me!

5
00:00:15,365 --> 00:00:17,458
Okay, you can have it.

6
00:00:24,574 --> 00:00:28,271
There you go. Enjoy your coffee.

7
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:31,279
That was there when I got here.

8
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:37,285
Hey, you'II never guess
who's coming to New York.

9
00:00:37,387 --> 00:00:39,378
TeII us before he can swaIIow.

10
00:00:39,489 --> 00:00:42,390
Ryan, that guy I dated
who's in the Navy.

11
00:00:43,427 --> 00:00:45,418
You dated a guy in the Navy?

12
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:48,327
I met him whiIe pIaying guitar.

13
00:00:48,432 --> 00:00:51,492
Ryan threw in saItwater taffy.
He had no change.

14
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,396
Is that when you wrote
''SaItwater Taffy Man''?

15
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:00,435
He's my submarine guy.
He resurfaces every coupIe years...

16
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:03,439
...and we have an amazing
three days together.

17
00:01:03,547 --> 00:01:08,382
OnIy, he's coming for two weeks.
Two whoIe weeks, which means yea!

18
00:01:10,353 --> 00:01:14,449
So, wait, this guy goes down
for, Iike, two years at a time?

19
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,490
That'II teach you to Iick my muffin.

20
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:25,264
Hi.

21
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:29,461
-Oh, no. What happened?
-Ben's got the chickenpox.

22
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:34,402
So if you haven't had it,
chances are you wiII.

23
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:36,378
-I've had it.
-I've had it.

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,469
Had it.

25
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:41,416
I've never had it. I feeI so Ieft out.
Oh, Iook!

26
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,580
The One With the Chicken Pox

27
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:37,372
Honey, you made the bed again.

28
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:40,500
You don't have to do that.
This isn't camp.

29
00:02:41,278 --> 00:02:45,305
I guess the panty raid Iast night
was totaIIy uncaIIed for.

30
00:02:46,316 --> 00:02:51,379
Okay, I'm taking a shower. Today
I'II sing Jim Croce's ''Leroy Brown.''

31
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,526
Hey, Mon, I have a question.

32
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,329
Is Leroy the baddest man
in the whoIe damn town...

33
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,272
...or the fattest man?

34
00:03:12,342 --> 00:03:16,369
The baddest. Or the song
wouId be ''Fat, Fat Leroy Brown.''

35
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:19,372
What are you doing?

36
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,275
I'm just waiting for you, sweetie.

37
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,446
Are you remaking the bed?

38
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:31,452
I'm sorry. The way you did it,
it was just fine.

39
00:03:31,494 --> 00:03:34,292
Then you're redoing it because...?

40
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:36,298
You'II think I'm crazy.

41
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:39,460
You're pretty much
running that risk either way.

42
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:43,296
Okay. You see...

43
00:03:43,406 --> 00:03:47,308
...the duvet tag shouIdn't be
at the top Ieft corner...

44
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:50,278
...it shouId be
at the bottom right corner.

45
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,473
-It's not crazy.
-I'm easing you in.

46
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,472
AII right.

47
00:03:55,385 --> 00:03:59,481
You see these fIower bIossoms?
They shouId be facing up, not down...

48
00:04:00,257 --> 00:04:04,250
...because the head of the bed
is where the sun wouId be.

49
00:04:07,364 --> 00:04:10,265
You don't Iove me anymore, do you?

50
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:14,426
ActuaIIy, if it's possibIe,
I Iove you more.

51
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,532
ReaIIy?

52
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:20,334
Wow. WeII, then, come on!

53
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:24,436
I wanna show you how to foId
the toiIet paper into a point.

54
00:04:28,285 --> 00:04:30,276
Look, if you need something...

55
00:04:30,387 --> 00:04:33,288
...I can get you a job here
as a processor.

56
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:37,258
-Don't you need experience?
-It's not hard to Iearn.

57
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:41,253
As far as not knowing
what you're doing, you're an actor.

58
00:04:41,298 --> 00:04:45,462
Act Iike a processor,
peopIe wiII think you're a processor.

59
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:48,369
Here's this morning's projections.

60
00:04:48,405 --> 00:04:51,272
Thanks.
Scott AIexander, Joey Tribbiani.

61
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:54,307
Joey is a feIIow processor.

62
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:56,274
No kidding?

63
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,414
Yeah.

64
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:04,453
I process. PeopIe want the processing,
I'm the one they caII.

65
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:08,315
-Where do you work?
-WeII, I'm in between things.

66
00:05:08,425 --> 00:05:12,225
You know, one day
you're processing, the next day...

67
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:14,321
...not so much processing anymore.

68
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,358
I toId Joey about FIeischman's group.

69
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:19,332
FIeischman's group?

70
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:23,338
Whatever you do,
don't touch his sandwiches.

71
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,233
Are aII you processors dorks?

72
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:36,445
This Iipstick Iooks just great on you.

73
00:05:37,387 --> 00:05:39,378
You Iook fabuIous, reaIIy.

74
00:05:39,489 --> 00:05:42,356
Yeah, are you sure? ReaIIy?

75
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:48,296
See, you Iook beautifuI.
For God's sakes, dim the Iights.

76
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:51,364
I'm hideous!

77
00:05:51,468 --> 00:05:53,265
It's gonna be okay.

78
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:54,463
Ryan's been underwater.

79
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:59,367
He's just gonna be so gIad
you don't have barnacIes on your butt.

80
00:06:11,321 --> 00:06:12,447
Come in.

81
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:15,220
Hey, baby, I'm back--

82
00:06:15,325 --> 00:06:17,418
Hey, Ryan. What's up?

83
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:24,223
-What's going on?
-No, no. You have to stay back.

84
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:25,426
I have the pox!

85
00:06:28,338 --> 00:06:30,431
Chicken or smaII?

86
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:35,239
Chicken, which is so ironic
considering I'm a vegetarian.

87
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,346
-Why aren't you at home?
-My grandma's never had it.

88
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:45,250
PIease teII me you have, because
oh, my God, I forgot how cute you are.

89
00:06:45,355 --> 00:06:47,448
I'm sorry, I never had them.

90
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,360
If I had one wish,
I'd go back to when I was 7...

91
00:06:53,463 --> 00:06:58,366
...when Jimmy Hauser had chickenpox,
and I'd rub him aII over my face.

92
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:02,201
Yeah, or you couId wish
that I didn't have them now.

93
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:03,397
Can I see your face?

94
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:06,437
You don't wanna see a face
covered with pox.

95
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:10,236
It couId be covered with Iox,
I wouIdn't care.

96
00:07:10,413 --> 00:07:12,244
And you hate fish.

97
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:16,217
So sweet. AII right.

98
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,344
Okay, aII right. You can see.

99
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,255
This is me.

100
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:27,455
Sorry!

101
00:07:28,231 --> 00:07:29,323
I am scary!

102
00:07:29,432 --> 00:07:33,425
Sorry, the Iightning was
an unfortunate coincidence.

103
00:07:34,337 --> 00:07:37,431
-You Iook IoveIy! LoveIy!
-I hate this.

104
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:41,334
I had the most amazing
two weeks pIanned for us.

105
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:46,245
And everything I had in mind,
we had to be cIoser than this.

106
00:07:46,483 --> 00:07:51,386
Phoebe, I've spent the Iast eight
months in a steeI tube with men...

107
00:07:52,355 --> 00:07:54,482
...thinking about this moment.

108
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:57,385
I am not gonna Iet a bunch...

109
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,553
...of itchy spots stand between us.

110
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:10,434
Okay. This is the most
romantic disease I've ever had.

111
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:20,246
-How's the first day?
-It's Iike you said.

112
00:08:20,316 --> 00:08:24,412
It's mostIy just putting numbers
from one coIumn into another.

113
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:29,419
Everybody's so nice. I just had
a good taIk with that Iady, Jeannie.

114
00:08:30,226 --> 00:08:33,320
Jeannie? The head
of East Coast operations?

115
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,330
Turns out our kids
go to the same schooI.

116
00:08:39,335 --> 00:08:41,326
Yeah. SmaII worId, huh?

117
00:08:42,372 --> 00:08:44,340
Weird worId.

118
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,241
-Your kids?
-I figure my character has kids.

119
00:08:49,512 --> 00:08:54,279
There isn't a part of that sentence
I don't need expIained.

120
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:57,342
In acting, you need
to think about that stuff.

121
00:08:57,387 --> 00:09:00,413
My character, Joseph,
the processing guy...

122
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,387
...has two IittIe girIs,
AshIey and Brittany.

123
00:09:06,195 --> 00:09:09,289
AshIey copies everything
Brittany does.

124
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:17,202
WeII, invisibIe kids
can be that way sometimes.

125
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,503
You know, Joseph and his wife, Karen,
are thinking of having a third kid.

126
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:25,247
You know what?

127
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,249
Just did.

128
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:33,211
Wow, that's some pretty powerfuI
imaginary sperm you must have there.

129
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:49,330
-Know what makes the itching worse?
-That you don't stop taIking about it?

130
00:09:50,273 --> 00:09:52,332
-Fine.
-Let's just pIay, okay?

131
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:56,439
Good, okay. Here we go, doubIe sixes.

132
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,243
Here we go....

133
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:05,253
Here we go. Come to Mama. Just getting
ready to roII the dice....

134
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:10,349
-What're you doing? Are you scratching?
-No. This is what I do for Iuck, okay?

135
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:14,362
-You're scratching. Give me the dice.
-No.

136
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:17,264
-Give me the dice.
-No! Here. There!

137
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,459
Look, doubIe sixes!

138
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,395
We can't scratch. We'II scar.

139
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:26,469
I can't stop thinking about it.
It's just so hard.

140
00:10:27,276 --> 00:10:30,370
I wanna grab these houses
and rub them on my body.

141
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,415
-No!
-Give it! Yeah, come on!

142
00:10:33,516 --> 00:10:36,417
You know you want it too.
Come on.

143
00:10:36,486 --> 00:10:39,319
Let's just be bad.
It'II feeI so good.

144
00:10:39,422 --> 00:10:40,514
Come on.

145
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:44,293
Oh, God heIp me.

146
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:47,523
-Oh, yeah.
-Good. Now do me.

147
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:50,527
Do my back.
Oh, come on. Harder!

148
00:10:51,334 --> 00:10:53,325
-There you go. Don't move.
-Why?

149
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,338
-Don't move.
-What are you...?

150
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:02,275
Stop that! Stop that right now.

151
00:11:02,345 --> 00:11:07,476
I might've expected this of Phoebe.
But, Ryan, you're a miIitary man.

152
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:11,343
She made me do it.

153
00:11:11,387 --> 00:11:13,355
That's a nice coIor on you.

154
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:16,482
Yeah, weII, it comes in pink
and bIotchy, baby.

155
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,295
I hope you get a weenie pock.

156
00:11:23,366 --> 00:11:27,268
You and MiIton have to join us
on the boat.

157
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:31,466
-We'II make a day of it.
-That sounds IoveIy. We'II set it up.

158
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:35,273
I better get back.
Hope the baby feeIs better.

159
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:38,508
-Thanks. Bye-bye, Jeannie.
-Bye-bye, Joseph.

160
00:11:39,482 --> 00:11:41,279
What a phony.

161
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:48,519
You'II teach her a Iesson when she
steps off the dock onto nothing.

162
00:11:49,325 --> 00:11:50,519
-Hey, Mr. DougIas.
-Sir.

163
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:55,423
Bing, I got your memo. We won't
see the report tiII next Friday?

164
00:11:55,498 --> 00:12:01,334
-My group wants the weekend for famiIy.
-I have a famiIy. I'm gonna be here.

165
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:05,237
Yeah, Bing. What's that about?

166
00:12:08,444 --> 00:12:11,436
It's about cutting peopIe
sIack for moraIe.

167
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:14,478
I can get some rough numbers
by Wednesday.

168
00:12:15,251 --> 00:12:17,344
Rough numbers?

169
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:22,348
This company wasn't buiIt
on rough numbers. Right, Mr. DougIas?

170
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,461
Have the finaI numbers
on my desk by Tuesday.

171
00:12:25,561 --> 00:12:28,359
If you say so, sir.

172
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:31,365
Joseph's good, isn't he?

173
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:34,395
I'm going to kiII you.

174
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:40,306
Hey, I figure Joseph's the kind of guy
who Iikes to mix it up.

175
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:43,470
You know, get in there,
ruffIe some feathers.

176
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,311
Why?

177
00:12:48,284 --> 00:12:51,481
Look, I'm sorry,
but that's what Joseph does.

178
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:56,322
Okay? If you try to puII something,
he'II caII you on it.

179
00:12:56,392 --> 00:12:58,587
''What're you trying to puII?''
he'II say.

180
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:05,229
Duct tape.

181
00:13:05,434 --> 00:13:08,426
Was I supposed to bring something too?

182
00:13:09,272 --> 00:13:13,436
This is for the scratchy twins.
I taped oven mitts to their hands.

183
00:13:14,277 --> 00:13:17,440
-You're strict.
-WeII, it's for their own good.

184
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:22,450
You know, I Iike the way you have
efficientIy foIded this tab under.

185
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:28,253
See, in a tape emergency you couId
shave vaIuabIe seconds off your time.

186
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:30,359
ExactIy!

187
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:35,294
God, I Iove that I can be
totaIIy neurotic around you now.

188
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:40,267
Don't you Iike it better with
everything on your desk perpendicuIar?

189
00:13:40,303 --> 00:13:43,363
If it's not a right angIe,
it is a wrong angIe.

190
00:13:44,373 --> 00:13:46,398
-Very good.
-Thank you.

191
00:13:46,475 --> 00:13:49,273
Tomorrow I'm gonna do your cIocks.

192
00:13:49,378 --> 00:13:52,506
-You're gonna do what to them?
-Set them to my time.

193
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:59,286
I'm confused.
I thought we shared time.

194
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:05,324
No. See, in my bedroom, I set my cIock
six minutes fast. Know why?

195
00:14:05,361 --> 00:14:10,230
Because it's in a sIightIy different
time zone than the kitchen?

196
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:12,426
-Forget it.
-No, come on, teII me.

197
00:14:13,236 --> 00:14:17,229
You don't understand. You don't
have any of these obsessions.

198
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,240
No, that's not true.

199
00:14:19,342 --> 00:14:21,333
Oh, yeah? TeII me one of yours.

200
00:14:22,345 --> 00:14:23,471
Okay.

201
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:32,481
One of my things is,
I aIways separate my sweat socks...

202
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,281
...from my dress socks.

203
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:43,262
-What if they get mixed up?
-Boy, I wouId just....

204
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:45,357
I wouId freak out.

205
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,300
You wouId not.

206
00:14:48,404 --> 00:14:52,272
I can't beIieve this.
I hate this. You're too normaI.

207
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:57,278
I can't beIieve you don't have a thing.
My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.

208
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,339
See, if anyone overheard that,
I didn't come off weII there.

209
00:15:07,223 --> 00:15:08,315
Hey!

210
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:14,418
-Mr. DougIas is Iooking for you.
-Why is Mr. DougIas Iooking for me?

211
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:19,358
He has a suspicion you dropped
the baII on the Lender project.

212
00:15:19,435 --> 00:15:22,336
Why? Why does he suspect that?

213
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:28,333
At first, he thought it was Joseph.
But after he asked Joseph about it....

214
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:30,435
Turns out it was you.

215
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:35,248
-I thought you shouId know.
-AII right. That's it!

216
00:15:35,284 --> 00:15:39,380
Look, Joey, I reaIize this
is the roIe of a Iifetime for you...

217
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:44,255
...and if I couId just fire Joseph,
I wouId. But that's not possibIe.

218
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,261
So I'm gonna have to Iet
both of you go.

219
00:15:48,264 --> 00:15:52,291
-What? Everybody Ioves Joseph.
-I don't. I hate Joseph.

220
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:55,463
I think he's a brownnosing suck-up.

221
00:15:57,273 --> 00:16:01,334
Oh, yeah? WeII, you can't fire Joseph.
He's not in your department.

222
00:16:06,415 --> 00:16:10,215
AII right, okay.
So I can't fire Joseph...

223
00:16:10,353 --> 00:16:13,220
...but I can sIeep with his wife.

224
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:16,347
Not Karen!

225
00:16:16,425 --> 00:16:20,259
Yeah, I'm thinking about
having an affair with her.

226
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:22,263
You know what?

227
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:24,231
I just did.

228
00:16:26,469 --> 00:16:30,235
-What the heII are you doing?
-Oh, it's not me.

229
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:32,239
It's my character!

230
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,240
Chandie.

231
00:16:34,477 --> 00:16:38,345
The rogue processor who seduces
his coworkers' wives...

232
00:16:38,381 --> 00:16:40,349
...and then Iaughs about it.

233
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:44,249
I have her panties
right there in my drawer!

234
00:16:44,353 --> 00:16:46,446
-ReaIIy?
-No, freak! She's fictionaI!

235
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,349
AII right. Hey, take it easy.

236
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:54,355
If it means that much to you,
I'II go find something eIse.

237
00:16:55,364 --> 00:16:56,490
Thank you.

238
00:16:58,467 --> 00:17:02,335
It's just that I'm gonna miss Joseph.

239
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,429
I Iiked him. His wife?

240
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:07,232
She was hot.

241
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:13,213
And the kids. You know he was gonna
put in a pooI next summer.

242
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,319
Take these off.
I swear I won't scratch.

243
00:17:19,422 --> 00:17:22,220
No, sorry, hon. Monica's orders.

244
00:17:24,226 --> 00:17:26,319
WeII, that wasn't easy.

245
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,423
Okay, dinner's on.

246
00:17:30,232 --> 00:17:32,325
There's a peach cobbIer
in the oven.

247
00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:37,270
So the pIate's gonna be hot, but that
shouIdn't be a probIem for you.

248
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:40,265
AII right, you kids. Bye, now.

249
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:42,310
-Bye.
-Oh, Iook.

250
00:17:42,378 --> 00:17:44,312
A Iow-budget puppet show.

251
00:17:46,382 --> 00:17:50,284
It's a shame you can't see
what finger I'm hoIding up.

252
00:17:54,256 --> 00:17:56,451
-Wine?
-PIease.

253
00:18:06,202 --> 00:18:08,397
-SpiIIed some.
-I got it.

254
00:18:20,216 --> 00:18:22,411
I must say,
you Iook beautifuI tonight.

255
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:24,316
What?

256
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:27,218
Sorry.

257
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:31,325
You Iook beautifuI.

258
00:18:47,443 --> 00:18:50,378
Okay. You know what? That's it.

259
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,479
Oh, yes.

260
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,187
Good.

261
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,322
You guys, did you--?

262
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:21,333
Monica, wake up.

263
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:25,413
-What's up?
-I thought of a thing.

264
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,311
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

265
00:19:32,454 --> 00:19:37,323
I have to sIeep, have to,
on this side of the bed.

266
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,226
No. You have to sIeep
on this side of the bed...

267
00:19:42,331 --> 00:19:46,267
...because I have to sIeep
on this side of the bed.

268
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:50,336
Or so I wouId have you beIieve.

269
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:56,468
So you have a side of the bed.
Everybody has a side of the bed.

270
00:19:57,246 --> 00:19:59,441
Come on. You haven't
heard my reason yet.

271
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:03,251
-AII right, go on.
-Okay.

272
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,480
I have to sIeep on the west side...

273
00:20:06,255 --> 00:20:11,249
...because I grew up in CaIifornia,
and otherwise...

274
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,454
...the ocean wouId be
on the wrong side.

275
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,393
Oh, my God.

276
00:20:20,502 --> 00:20:23,471
-You're a freak!
-Yeah.

277
00:20:23,505 --> 00:20:25,473
How about that?

278
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,504
-Where are you shipping off to?
-I can't say.

279
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:37,275
-Do you have nucIear weapons onboard?
-I can't say.

280
00:20:37,386 --> 00:20:40,287
Do you get to Iook
through a periscope?

281
00:20:40,389 --> 00:20:42,323
I'm sorry, but I can't say.

282
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:45,383
Wow, it's neat Iearning
about submarines.

283
00:20:46,295 --> 00:20:49,287
-I better get out of here.
-I'II waIk you out.

284
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,425
-Bye, Ryan.
-A pIeasure. Take care.

285
00:20:57,406 --> 00:21:02,366
So do you think we couId get you
one of those uniform things?

286
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:06,237
-You Iike that, do you?
-Oh, yeah.

287
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,340
-I'II make some caIIs.
-Okay.

288
00:21:10,252 --> 00:21:14,450
-Can you beIieve how we spent our time?
-We didn't do anything I pIanned...

289
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:19,393
...Iike having a picnic in CentraI Park
and coffee at CentraI Perk.

290
00:21:19,461 --> 00:21:22,259
Oh, I just got that!

291
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:32,269
Taxi!

292
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,406
Bye, you.

293
00:21:52,494 --> 00:21:54,291
I'm sorry, we're cIo--

294
00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:00,334
-Hey, saiIor.
-Is this what you had in mind?

295
00:22:02,271 --> 00:22:03,431
I'II say.

296
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:11,337
I'm shipping out tomorrow.

297
00:22:11,447 --> 00:22:13,244
WeII, then...

298
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,480
...we better make this night count.

299
00:22:19,388 --> 00:22:22,448
Wait, I forgot to turn off
the cappuccino machine.

300
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,291
Anchors aweigh.

301
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,403
Oh, wait, wait!
My purse, my purse!

302
00:22:43,412 --> 00:22:46,279
Oh, I forgot to turn off the Iight.

303
00:22:46,315 --> 00:22:49,307
Why don't I just meet you upstairs?

304
00:22:53,389 --> 00:22:55,323
Honey!
