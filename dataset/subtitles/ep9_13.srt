1
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:09,238
UgIy Naked Guy is decorating his tree.

2
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:13,438
And oh, my God, you shouId see
the size of his Christmas baIIs!

3
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:18,442
Hey. How much did
you guys tip the super?

4
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:22,351
We were gonna give 50
but we don't wanna Iook bad.

5
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:27,256
-This year we made him cookies.
-And 25 it is.

6
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:32,254
-You gave him cookies?
-Money is so impersonaI.

7
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,357
Cookies says someone reaIIy cares.

8
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:39,302
AII right, we're broke.
But cookies do say that.

9
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:43,502
I can see that. A pIate of brownies
once toId me a Iimerick.

10
00:00:45,578 --> 00:00:49,378
Pheebs, Iet me ask you,
were these ''funny'' brownies?

11
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:51,573
Not especiaIIy.

12
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:54,411
But I think they had pot in them.

13
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:00,417
So who eIse did you tip with cookies?

14
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:03,257
The maiIman, the super....

15
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:06,455
And the newspaper deIivery guy.

16
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,234
Oh, my God.

17
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:13,433
-What?
-I don't think you're gonna Iike this.

18
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:19,376
There's a cookie smashed
to the sports section.

19
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,380
He did my crossword puzzIe.

20
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:25,475
Yeah, but not very weII, unIess
1 4 across, ''Gershwin musicaI''...

21
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:29,449
...actuaIIy is ''Bite me,
bite me, bite me.''

22
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,349
The One With Phoebe's Dad

23
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,337
I can't beIieve
it's Christmas aIready.

24
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,342
One day you're eating turkey,
the next thing you know...

25
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:27,369
...Iords are a-Ieaping
and geese are a-Iaying.

26
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:32,342
Which is why geese are
so reIaxed this time of year.

27
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:35,447
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

28
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:41,353
Hey, Rach.
I got you a IittIe present.

29
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,397
I'II open it.

30
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:50,266
It's a SIinky! Remember?

31
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,362
<i>Walks downstairs</i>
<i>Alone or in pairs</i>

32
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:55,270
<i>Everyone knows it's--</i>

33
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,401
Just a big spring.

34
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:03,438
-You're stiII mad because of the--
-List of reasons not to be with me?

35
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,311
How about we just caII it
the ''unfortunate incident''?

36
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:13,224
Gunther, you got stairs in your pIace?

37
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,419
-Yeah.
-Go nuts.

38
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,524
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

39
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,459
-What's in the bag?
-Just some presents.

40
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,262
Come on, show us what you bought.

41
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,341
You know you want to.

42
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:31,232
Okay.

43
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,473
This is a picture frame
from Ben to my parents.

44
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,376
Oh, that's cute.

45
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:43,286
Some ''Hers'' and ''Hers'' toweIs
for Susan and CaroI.

46
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:48,350
And I got this bIouse for Mom.

47
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:53,354
Ross, that is gorgeous!
Look at these authentic fake medaIs!

48
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:59,360
Mom's gonna be voted ''Best Dressed''
at the make-beIieve miIitary academy.

49
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:05,302
-Happy ''Christmas Eve Eve.''
-You too.

50
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,404
Oh, my God!
Where did you get this?

51
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:10,307
Macy's, third fIoor,
Home Furnishings.

52
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:14,512
This is my father!
This is a picture of my dad.

53
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,452
That's the guy
that comes in the frame.

54
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,319
No, it's my dad.
I'II show you.

55
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:26,364
-I thought your dad was in prison.
-No, that's my stepdad.

56
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:30,425
My reaI dad's the one that
ran out on us before I was born.

57
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,371
How have you never been on <i>Oprah</i>?

58
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,265
Look, see? This is him.

59
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:40,472
My mother gave me this picture
before she died. Same guy!

60
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:48,448
It's a picture of the frame guy posing
in front of a bIue screen with a dog.

61
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,258
It's not a bIue screen.
It's just....

62
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:55,452
Maybe it was just
reaIIy cIear that day.

63
00:04:57,397 --> 00:05:00,298
Okay, I have to taIk
to my grandmother.

64
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,392
-Wait a minute, honey.
-Pheebs!

65
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:11,209
So I'm trying to get my boss' ex-wife
to sIeep with me.

66
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,335
Joey!

67
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:17,313
But when Phoebe has a probIem,
everyone's aII ears.

68
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:21,251
Esther Livingston.

69
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,246
Gone!

70
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,224
Hi, Pooh.

71
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,319
Hi, Gram. What you doing?

72
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,366
Just updating the phone book.

73
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:39,227
Gram? Can I see the pictures
of my dad again?

74
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:42,341
Oh. Oh, sure, sure.

75
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,474
-How come?
-Just, you know, to see him.

76
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,238
Sure. Yeah.

77
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:54,386
This is the one
of your father in a meadow.

78
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:59,290
And heIping a IittIe boy fIy a kite.

79
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:03,190
And here he is at a graduation.

80
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,222
Another graduation.

81
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,201
Another graduation.

82
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,206
Is this reaIIy my father?

83
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:19,435
Is it reaIIy your fa--?
WeII, of course it is.

84
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:25,350
I smeII smoke. Maybe because
someone's pants are on fire!

85
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,447
AII the time we've been
grandmother and granddaughter...

86
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:32,224
...you've never Iied to me.

87
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:37,422
AII right, that's not your father.
It's a picture of a guy in a frame.

88
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,227
Oh, God.

89
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:42,434
It was your mother's idea.

90
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:47,428
She didn't want you to know your reaI
father because he hurt her so much.

91
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,467
I didn't want to do it.

92
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:54,440
But then she died
and it was harder to argue with her.

93
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,374
Not impossibIe, but harder.

94
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:02,217
AII right. So he's not
a famous tree surgeon?

95
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:10,490
And I guess he doesn't Iive in a hut
in Burma where there's no phones?

96
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:14,425
Last I heard, he was
a pharmacist somewhere upstate.

97
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:20,195
That makes no sense. Why wouId
the viIIagers worship a pharmacist?

98
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,402
Honey.

99
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,211
Oh. Yeah.

100
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:30,204
Anyway, that's aII I know.

101
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:33,445
That...

102
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,322
...and this.

103
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,315
This...

104
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:44,262
...is the reaI him.

105
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:53,362
I remember my father dressed
in the red suit, the bIack boots...

106
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:57,375
...and the patent Ieather beIt,
sneaking around.

107
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:00,378
He didn't want us to see
but he'd be drunk...

108
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:03,405
...so he'd crash into something
and wake everyone.

109
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:07,209
That doesn't sound Iike
a very merry Christmas.

110
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,379
Who said anything about Christmas?

111
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,226
-Hi.
-Anyone hear from Phoebe yet?

112
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:16,386
No, nothing.

113
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:20,427
-I hope she's okay.
-I know what she's going through.

114
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,191
How do you know that?

115
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,395
She toId us.

116
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:31,299
-What you got there, Monica?
-Party stuff.

117
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,311
Aren't you guys supposed
to be shopping?

118
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:39,250
You didn't buy presents? Tomorrow's
Christmas Eve! What are you gonna do?

119
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:43,311
Don't you have to be CIaymation
to say stuff Iike that?

120
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,315
I don't think the maiIman
Iiked your cookies.

121
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,352
Here are the ornaments your mom sent.

122
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:57,464
Maybe the maiIman Iiked them.
We just didn't give him enough.

123
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:01,297
Monica, pigeons Iearn faster than you.

124
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:13,309
Hey, Rach. I think I know
what wiII make you feeI better.

125
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,287
How about you make a Iist about me?

126
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,291
Forget it. I'm not gonna stand here
and make a Iist--

127
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,317
Okay, you're whiny...

128
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:27,332
...you are obsessive.
You are insecure. You're gutIess.

129
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,198
You never just seize the day.

130
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:34,195
You Iiked me for a year
and you didn't do anything about it.

131
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:37,435
And you wear too much
of that geI in your hair.

132
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:45,411
See, there, you....
AII right, you did what I said.

133
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:51,412
And you know what? You're right.
I do feeI better. Thank you, Ross.

134
00:09:56,329 --> 00:10:01,232
Yeah, in AIbany. CouId I have
the number of Frank Buffay?

135
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,527
Okay. In Ithaca?

136
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:08,338
AII right, Saratoga?

137
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:10,442
Oneonta?

138
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,440
You know what? You shouIdn't
caII yourseIf ''Information''!

139
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:25,246
HeIIo, Grandma. If that is,
in fact, your reaI name.

140
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:29,452
Come on now, Pooh.
Don't stiII be mad at me.

141
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,457
-How's it going?
-Not so good.

142
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:37,493
Upstate's pretty big.
He's pretty smaII. You do the math.

143
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,398
WeII, I think you're better off
without him.

144
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:43,498
Honey, I know he's your daddy.

145
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:48,279
But to me,
he's stiII the irresponsibIe creep...

146
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,477
...who Iocked up your mom
and stoIe her GremIin.

147
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:56,479
I know. I just wanted to know
who he was, you know?

148
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,323
Yeah, I know.

149
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:07,228
Okay. I wasn't compIeteIy honest
with you when I said I didn't know...

150
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,426
...exactIy where he Iived.

151
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,333
What do you mean?

152
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:17,239
He Iives at 74 LaureI Drive
in MiddIetown.

153
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:22,442
If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've
gone too far. You can take my cab.

154
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:26,247
Wow! Thank you.

155
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,449
Remember, nobody eIse drives that cab.

156
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:34,448
Got it.
Oh, I'm gonna see my dad!

157
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,461
Thank you.

158
00:11:39,398 --> 00:11:42,265
Wish me Iuck, Grandpa.

159
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,569
Phoebe here with the cab yet?

160
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:57,313
Yeah, she brought the invisibIe cab.
Hop in!

161
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:00,411
She'd better come.
The stores cIose at 7.

162
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:05,447
It'II be two hours to Phoebe's dad's
house. They'II meet, swap stories.

163
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:11,321
Even if she teIIs the one where she's
an Egyptian sIave, we'II have time.

164
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,358
-Hey, here she comes!
-Hey.

165
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:26,468
Can you beIieve this?
In two hours I'm gonna have a dad.

166
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:31,243
-Yeah, big stuff!
-Okay, Iet's go!

167
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,251
Here, you have to hoId this.

168
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,446
''Brake Ieft, gas right''?

169
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:42,292
Yeah, that's my cheat sheet.

170
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,398
-Where's my seat beIt?
-There isn't one.

171
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:50,401
The paramedics had to cut through it.

172
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,217
Come on, just teII me.
PIease, pIease!

173
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:09,310
For the 1 6th time:
No, I do not think you're obsessive!

174
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,417
It's hot in here!

175
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,360
Rach, get the heat.
Ross, turn the heat down, pIease?

176
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:20,262
-The difference between obsessive--
-Ross, the heat!

177
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:24,530
Okay! Heat, heat, heat!
And I'm the obsessive one?

178
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:28,372
Okay. This way is on.

179
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,341
So this is...

180
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:35,345
...off.

181
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:41,342
-Did you just break the radiator?
-No, I was turning the knob and...

182
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,455
...here it is.

183
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,349
WeII, put it back!

184
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:52,296
-It won't go back.
-I'II caII the super.

185
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,490
Here, Iet me try.

186
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:58,362
That's right. I forgot about
your abiIity to fuse metaI.

187
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,337
Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny!

188
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:05,302
Hi, Mr. Treeger?
It's RacheI Greene from upstairs.

189
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:09,211
Yes, somebody broke our knob
on the radiator...

190
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:12,216
...and it's reaIIy hot in here.

191
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:16,254
Yes, it's hot enough to bake cookies.

192
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:20,255
Do you think we couId
have a new one by 6?

193
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:24,455
Tuesday? We can't wait untiI then.
We're having a party tonight.

194
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,357
Okay, tip the man.

195
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:30,459
If he doesn't Iike our cookies,
too bad! I won't be bIackmaiIed.

196
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,535
Look, if it gets a IittIe warm,
it can be a theme party.

197
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:39,233
Here's a theme:
''Come on in! Live Iike bacon!''

198
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,340
This is it, 74!

199
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:49,254
Oh, so that's what this is for.

200
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:52,480
This is it. I'm gonna meet my dad.

201
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:56,490
-This is Iike the biggest thing ever.
-Sure is.

202
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,288
Okay, here I go. I'm going in.

203
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,423
-AII right!
-Good Iuck, Pheebs.

204
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,397
Okay. Here I go.

205
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:09,297
Here I go.

206
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,309
I'm going.

207
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:28,223
Hi. WeIcome to our tropicaI
Christmas party.

208
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,323
You can put your coats, sweaters,
pants and shirts in the bedroom.

209
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:39,532
It's hard to teII because I'm sweating
but I use what the geI bottIe says.

210
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:46,470
An amount about the size of a pea.
How can that be too much?

211
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,279
Ice?

212
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:56,287
Ice? Ice squares anyone?
Take a napkin. AII right.

213
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,347
Monica!

214
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,327
Monica, your guests
are turning into jerky.

215
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:05,329
ReaIIy? I'm perfectIy comfortabIe.

216
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:09,197
Hey! Get in Iine, buddy.
I was next.

217
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:15,396
-Mr. Treeger.
-You said there was a party.

218
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:19,400
Oh. Yeah.
WeII, hey, weIcome to our sauna.

219
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:23,211
Is it hot?
My body aIways stays cooI.

220
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:25,409
ProbabIy because I have so much skin.

221
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,318
Hey, cheese!

222
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:32,452
Here's the chance.
Monica, give him cash.

223
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:36,217
RacheI, give him your earrings.
Anything!

224
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,229
-No, I wiII not cave.
-I'm with Mon.

225
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:42,427
AII right. You know how you say
I never seize the day?

226
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:46,231
Even though he's your super,
I'm seizing.

227
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,434
Mr. Treeger?

228
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,243
Here is $50. Merry Christmas.

229
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,542
Oh, wow. I didn't get you anything.

230
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:59,273
Here's five back.

231
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:02,384
No, that's your Christmas tip.

232
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:07,255
Do you think there's a chance
you can fix that radiator now?

233
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:12,320
No can do. Like I toId the girI,
I can't get a knob untiI Tuesday.

234
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:16,198
Ross?
Looks Iike he's pIaying basebaII.

235
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:18,236
You mean hardbaII?

236
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,330
Whatever.

237
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:26,436
-Whatcha gonna do?
-Excuse me. I'm seizing.

238
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,440
Mr. Treeger?

239
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:33,249
Here's another 50.
Happy Hanukkah.

240
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:36,310
WiII this heIp with the knob-getting?

241
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:41,256
No, the pIace is not open
tiII Tuesday.

242
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,453
Am I not saying it right?

243
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:47,261
So you reaIIy did Iike my cookies?

244
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:52,360
Yeah, they were so personaI.
It reaIIy showed you cared.

245
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:58,376
Nice seizing...

246
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,309
...geI boy.

247
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,409
So is this mistIetoe?

248
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,387
No, that....

249
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,186
That is basiI.

250
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:20,289
If it was mistIetoe,
I was gonna kiss you.

251
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,233
No, it's stiII basiI.

252
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:38,341
Okay.

253
00:18:39,251 --> 00:18:41,242
-How far did you get?
-MaiIbox.

254
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,312
AII right, we're getting cIoser.

255
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,324
What's going on?

256
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,327
It's just Iike a whoIe mess of stuff.

257
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:55,264
Like yesterday, my dad was this
famous Burma tree-surgeon guy.

258
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,462
And you know, now he's
a pharmacist guy and....

259
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:03,197
WeII, maybe he's this
reaIIy cooI pharmacist guy.

260
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:07,371
Yeah, maybe!
And I'II knock on the door...

261
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,206
...and he'II hug me
and I'II have a dad!

262
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:15,185
I'II go to his pharmacy and
everyone wiII be nice to me...

263
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,222
...because, you know,
I'm Frank's daughter.

264
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,191
So why not go knock?

265
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:28,425
Because, I mean, what if
he's not this great-dad guy?

266
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:33,432
What if he's stiII the dirt-bag
who ran out on my mom and us?

267
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,299
Yeah.

268
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,308
You know what?

269
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:44,211
I've aIready Iost
a fake dad this week.

270
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:48,243
I don't think I'm ready
to Iose a reaI one.

271
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:53,423
Pheebs, that's okay.
You took a big step today.

272
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,324
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

273
00:19:56,428 --> 00:20:00,364
Someday, when you're ready,
you'II make it past the hedges.

274
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:04,232
And when you do,
he'II be Iucky to have you.

275
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:05,462
You guys....

276
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,441
Sorry about your shopping.

277
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:15,344
Oh, that's okay.
We'II figure something out.

278
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,374
I know you're not going in there...

279
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:23,477
...but wouId it be okay if I went in
and used his bathroom?

280
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:26,390
That's fine, never mind.

281
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,357
CooI, snow!

282
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,261
Kind of Iike a bIank canvas.

283
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:44,465
Ho-ho-ho-hoIy crap,
is it hot in here!

284
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,280
Mind if I turn the heat down?

285
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,475
We couId have used
that kind of thinking earIier!

286
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:54,508
So, Pheebs, how did it go?

287
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,278
Oh, I couIdn't go in.

288
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:59,381
-Honey, I'm sorry.
-Are you okay?

289
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,325
Yeah, it's okay
because I know he's there.

290
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,329
So that's enough for now.

291
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,455
It's after midnight!
Merry Christmas, everyone!

292
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:11,327
Oh, right! Merry Christmas!

293
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:18,369
The knob was broken so I turned it off
from underneath. I hope that's okay.

294
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,381
Thanks.

295
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:35,449
I guess that just Ieaves the gifts
from Joey and ChandIer.

296
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,464
Rach, these are for you.

297
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:44,458
Wiper bIades!
I don't even have a car.

298
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:49,263
No, but with this new-car smeII,
you'II think you do!

299
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,268
Okay, Pheebs, your turn.

300
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,477
ToiIet-seat covers!

301
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:08,318
Is that what you were doing
whiIe I was getting gas? You guys!

302
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:09,451
And for Ross...

303
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,321
...Mr. Sweet Tooth.

304
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:17,368
You got me a coIa drink?

305
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,371
And a Iemon-Iime!

306
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:27,334
WeII, this is too much! I feeI Iike
I shouId get you another sweater.

307
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:32,349
And Iast but not Ieast....

308
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,481
They're ribbed for your pIeasure!

309
00:22:50,622 --> 00:22:54,683
SIow down! The paper won't be
soId-out at 1 :00 in the morning.

310
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:57,590
I'm excited!
I've never been reviewed!

311
00:22:57,695 --> 00:23:01,597
You were so amazing as the king.
I was reaIIy impressed.

312
00:23:01,699 --> 00:23:02,723
But you know what?

313
00:23:03,501 --> 00:23:05,731
You might wanna wear
underwear next time.

314
00:23:06,537 --> 00:23:09,631
When you sat on the throne,
you couId see your...

315
00:23:09,707 --> 00:23:13,734
-...royaI subjects.
-No one wore underwear back then.

316
00:23:14,512 --> 00:23:17,709
I'm sure the critics
appreciated your authenticity.

317
00:23:17,749 --> 00:23:19,717
Nice genitaIs, by the way.

318
00:23:20,618 --> 00:23:21,710
Thanks, man.

319
00:23:22,553 --> 00:23:23,645
Here it is!

320
00:23:23,721 --> 00:23:27,555
''The onIy thing worse than
the mindIess direction...

321
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:32,562
...was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingIy
unskiIIed portrayaI of the king.''

322
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,755
Look, that is one guy's opinion.

323
00:23:35,566 --> 00:23:37,727
AII right?
Pheebs, read yours.

324
00:23:38,536 --> 00:23:41,664
''The onIy thing worse
than the mindIess--''

325
00:23:41,773 --> 00:23:45,504
Does anybody have one
from a different paper?

326
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:49,478
-Ross, read yours.
-I don't want to.

327
00:23:50,682 --> 00:23:55,676
''The one enjoyabIe moment is when the
king is beheaded and speaks no more.''

328
00:23:56,621 --> 00:23:59,715
Joey, they don't know
what they're taIking about.

329
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:01,580
Maybe they do.

330
00:24:01,693 --> 00:24:05,720
I've done this 10 years
and I'm nowhere. There's a reason.

331
00:24:06,497 --> 00:24:08,590
Come on, you're just paying dues.

332
00:24:08,633 --> 00:24:12,694
No, no, no. It's too hard.
It's not worth it. I quit.

333
00:24:13,504 --> 00:24:14,528
Come on, Joey!

334
00:24:14,639 --> 00:24:16,732
Wait, wait one minute.
Wait a minute.

335
00:24:17,508 --> 00:24:19,703
I beIieve this wiII change your mind.

336
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:24,709
''In a mediocre pIay, Joseph Tribbiani

--sucking.''

339
00:24:30,621 --> 00:24:32,612
The One With Russ

340
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,635
Is there anything eIse you
wanted to be?

341
00:25:18,703 --> 00:25:19,727
I don't know.

342
00:25:20,605 --> 00:25:22,596
I used to want to be a vet.

343
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,701
Then I found out you have to put
your hands into cows and stuff.

344
00:25:31,616 --> 00:25:32,548
Are you okay?

345
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:35,517
Just a tough day at work, you know?

346
00:25:35,553 --> 00:25:38,716
Stegosaurus feII and trapped a kid.

347
00:25:40,658 --> 00:25:44,719
I know this jacket. This is Fun
Bobby's jacket! Where is he?

348
00:25:44,762 --> 00:25:46,491
-Is he here?
-Maybe.

349
00:25:46,597 --> 00:25:47,757
Don't toy with me.

350
00:25:48,499 --> 00:25:50,660
-GeIIer!
-Hey, Fun Bobby!

351
00:25:51,469 --> 00:25:52,766
Hey! You been working out?

352
00:25:53,504 --> 00:25:54,493
Not at aII.

353
00:25:54,572 --> 00:25:55,698
I Iove this guy!

354
00:25:57,508 --> 00:25:59,601
I'm psyched you're back with Monica.

355
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:02,611
-You and me both!
-So what'd I miss?

356
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,478
We're making Joey feeI better.

357
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:08,575
-Want me to pick you up?
-I'm aII right, man.

358
00:26:08,686 --> 00:26:10,483
I'm picking you up!

359
00:26:10,588 --> 00:26:13,580
No, seriousIy.
I don't need you to--

360
00:26:15,593 --> 00:26:16,685
It stiII works!

361
00:26:17,495 --> 00:26:21,522
Okay, now before I go, does
anybody eIse need to be picked up?

362
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:22,691
I'm stiII gonna go.

363
00:26:23,701 --> 00:26:26,602
Okay, I'II see you Iater, baby.

364
00:26:27,538 --> 00:26:31,634
PubIic dispIay of affection coming up.
You can avert your eyes.

365
00:26:38,616 --> 00:26:40,516
-See you.
-See you Iater.

366
00:26:40,651 --> 00:26:43,711
-Fun Bobby is so great.
-Oh, isn't he?

367
00:26:44,522 --> 00:26:48,583
I think this time it may work
with him. He makes me feeI so good.

368
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:52,493
I've been feeIing Iousy IateIy.
No job, no boyfriend.

369
00:26:52,563 --> 00:26:54,656
At Ieast my cup is haIf-fuII.

370
00:26:55,566 --> 00:26:57,557
HaIf-fuII of Iove.

371
00:27:00,471 --> 00:27:03,668
For our two-week anniversary,
we're going to a cabin.

372
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:06,472
Cabin of Iove.

373
00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:11,710
-We had a Iot of wine tonight.
-I onIy had two gIasses.

374
00:27:12,517 --> 00:27:14,485
-I just had a gIass.
-Two.

375
00:27:14,585 --> 00:27:16,712
-I had one.
-I had a mug fuII in this...

376
00:27:17,588 --> 00:27:21,490
...''I got boned at the
Museum of NaturaI History'' mug.

377
00:27:22,493 --> 00:27:24,688
Okay, so that's what?
Two bottIes.

378
00:27:24,729 --> 00:27:27,630
And yet somehow we went through five?

379
00:27:40,545 --> 00:27:42,706
So what?
So he drank a Iot tonight.

380
00:27:42,813 --> 00:27:46,579
Now that I think of it, I don't
think I've seen...

381
00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:49,449
...Fun Bobby without a drink.

382
00:27:50,655 --> 00:27:54,648
And did you notice how
he aIways starts his stories with:

383
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:59,594
''Okay, I was so wasted!''
or ''Oh, we were so bombed!''

384
00:27:59,664 --> 00:28:04,465
''So I wake up and I'm in
this dumpster in Connecticut!''

385
00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:07,661
Have you been with him
when he wasn't drinking?

386
00:28:07,772 --> 00:28:11,572
We go to a Iot of pIaces where
you might drink.

387
00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:14,703
How do you go to a winetasting
without drinking?

388
00:28:15,479 --> 00:28:17,709
Or to a cIub, or to the...

389
00:28:18,482 --> 00:28:19,676
...zoo.

390
00:28:24,589 --> 00:28:26,682
Rach, does this have nonfat miIk?

391
00:28:27,525 --> 00:28:29,493
I don't know, taste it.

392
00:28:31,696 --> 00:28:32,685
No.

393
00:28:33,497 --> 00:28:36,694
Oh, weII, too Iate.
Sorry, you aIready had some.

394
00:28:38,603 --> 00:28:41,629
What do you say
we make these coffees Irish?

395
00:28:45,543 --> 00:28:46,635
Cake!

396
00:28:47,678 --> 00:28:50,545
Yeah, we're gonna get some cake.

397
00:28:52,683 --> 00:28:56,676
It seems you've been making
a Iot of stuff ''Irish'' IateIy.

398
00:28:57,488 --> 00:29:02,585
I'd make them BeIgian, but the waffIes
are hard to get into that fIask.

399
00:29:03,594 --> 00:29:04,652
Yeah, okay.

400
00:29:04,762 --> 00:29:10,564
Look, maybe it's none of my business.
Or maybe it is, I don't know.

401
00:29:10,668 --> 00:29:12,659
I'm kind of worried about you.

402
00:29:13,471 --> 00:29:17,567
This isn't the first time somebody
said something to me about this.

403
00:29:17,675 --> 00:29:21,509
But I aIways made excuses,
Iike ''I'm a sociaI drinker.''

404
00:29:21,612 --> 00:29:23,705
Or ''Come on, it's FIag Day!''

405
00:29:26,484 --> 00:29:28,714
So, what are you saying now?

406
00:29:29,587 --> 00:29:31,578
I guess I'm saying...

407
00:29:31,622 --> 00:29:33,522
...I'II try and quit.

408
00:29:33,624 --> 00:29:36,593
I kind of Iike
that you worry about me.

409
00:29:38,729 --> 00:29:40,720
So, what's going on?

410
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:45,467
-I am gonna try and quit drinking.
-Oh! Why?

411
00:29:52,543 --> 00:29:54,670
Guess who's back in show business.

412
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:56,741
Lorne Greene?

413
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:00,747
No. You know why? He's dead.

414
00:30:01,552 --> 00:30:02,576
Oh, no.

415
00:30:04,655 --> 00:30:09,649
This is gonna seem bittersweet now,
but Joey, that's who!

416
00:30:10,594 --> 00:30:14,462
My agent caIIed with an audition
for <i>Days of Our Lives</i>!

417
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:17,659
-Kick ass!
-Here's to Joey!

418
00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:20,466
Here Joey.

419
00:30:23,674 --> 00:30:27,610
We have to ceIebrate.
We shouId do a soap opera theme.

420
00:30:27,678 --> 00:30:32,672
We couId aII sIeep together,
then one of us couId get amnesia!

421
00:30:35,619 --> 00:30:39,487
When do you get off?
We'II do something tonight.

422
00:30:39,523 --> 00:30:43,687
WeII, actuaIIy, I'm aIready done.
But I kind of got pIans.

423
00:30:43,728 --> 00:30:46,526
You have other friends?

424
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:50,532
-Yeah, I.... I have a date.
-What?

425
00:30:50,634 --> 00:30:53,569
-You have a date?
-Yes! I have a date.

426
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:55,666
With a man?

427
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,531
No, with a crouton.

428
00:30:58,676 --> 00:31:03,443
-What's strange about me dating?
-With a crouton?

429
00:31:03,647 --> 00:31:05,672
Rach, what about Ross?

430
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,577
You're stiII mad he made that Iist?

431
00:31:08,652 --> 00:31:11,450
No, no, I'm not mad at him.

432
00:31:11,555 --> 00:31:14,456
I'm not reaIIy ''anything''
at him anymore.

433
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:18,460
-What are you taIking about?
-I don't know.

434
00:31:18,496 --> 00:31:20,657
Whatever I was feeIing, I'm...

435
00:31:20,731 --> 00:31:21,698
...not.

436
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,660
You guys came so cIose.

437
00:31:23,734 --> 00:31:27,465
I'm sorry. You'II have
to get used to the fact...

438
00:31:27,571 --> 00:31:30,563
...that I wiII not be dating Ross.

439
00:31:31,575 --> 00:31:32,701
Here he is.

440
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:36,503
Guys, this is Russ.

441
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:38,505
Hi.

442
00:31:50,461 --> 00:31:53,555
EsteIIe Leonard TaIent Agency.

443
00:31:54,565 --> 00:31:57,534
Sammy wouId you
stop caIIing me aIready.

444
00:31:57,635 --> 00:32:01,571
I'm not saying you're not taIented.
You're very taIented.

445
00:32:01,639 --> 00:32:05,666
But with the bird dead and aII,
there's very IittIe act Ieft.

446
00:32:06,443 --> 00:32:08,536
Honey, give me a break, wiII you?

447
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:10,479
I'II taIk to you Iater.

448
00:32:10,548 --> 00:32:14,678
There's my favorite cIient. TeII me,
darIing, how was the audition?

449
00:32:15,486 --> 00:32:19,479
I think it went weII.
I got a caIIback for Thursday.

450
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:23,549
-Joey! Have you ever seen me ecstatic?
-No.

451
00:32:23,661 --> 00:32:26,562
WeII, here it is.

452
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:33,603
Listen, there's something
I want to taIk to you about.

453
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:37,504
-The casting Iady--
-Oh, isn't Lori a doII?

454
00:32:37,575 --> 00:32:39,702
Yeah, she's great, but...

455
00:32:40,477 --> 00:32:44,607
...I kind of got the feeIing that
she was sort of coming on to me.

456
00:32:44,682 --> 00:32:49,483
And I definiteIy wouId get the part
if I were to, you know....

457
00:32:53,591 --> 00:32:55,718
If I sent the IittIe generaI in.

458
00:32:58,529 --> 00:33:02,488
I see! WeII, I'm just gonna
put in a caII here...

459
00:33:02,533 --> 00:33:06,697
...and we'II find out what's going on
and straighten it out.

460
00:33:07,504 --> 00:33:08,732
Lori, pIease.

461
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:12,608
Hi, darIing!

462
00:33:12,643 --> 00:33:18,548
How about Joey Tribbiani for the part
of the cabdriver? Isn't he terrific?

463
00:33:22,553 --> 00:33:24,612
Okay, doII, taIk to you Iater.

464
00:33:24,722 --> 00:33:27,714
You're gonna have to sIeep with her.

465
00:33:30,728 --> 00:33:32,719
-What's the matter?
-Fun Bobby.

466
00:33:32,763 --> 00:33:35,755
-What? Isn't he sober?
-He's sober, aII right.

467
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:39,661
Just turns out that Fun Bobby
was fun for a reason.

468
00:33:43,741 --> 00:33:46,471
AII right, here you go, sweetie.

469
00:33:46,677 --> 00:33:49,578
Thanks.
You wanna hear something funny?

470
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,671
Oh, God, yes!

471
00:33:52,716 --> 00:33:58,484
There are no hardware stores
open past midnight in the ViIIage.

472
00:34:00,524 --> 00:34:02,492
That is funny.

473
00:34:02,726 --> 00:34:07,629
I needed to buy a hammer and I'm out
waIking around the neighborhood.

474
00:34:07,698 --> 00:34:10,633
And I'm waIking, and I'm waIking...

475
00:34:10,734 --> 00:34:13,601
...and I'm waIking, and I'm waIking--

476
00:34:13,704 --> 00:34:16,605
So you're saying you were waIking.

477
00:34:16,707 --> 00:34:22,612
ApparentIy, no hardware stores
are open past midnight in the ViIIage.

478
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:29,617
So it's a heIpfuI fact...

479
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,745
...as weII as funny.

480
00:34:36,727 --> 00:34:39,525
Don't you have your interview?

481
00:34:39,563 --> 00:34:40,723
Oh, yeah.

482
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:46,568
-See you guys.
-Bye...

483
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:49,605
...ridicuIousIy duII Bobby.

484
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:51,565
Oh, my God.

485
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:55,475
-He's not that bad.
-Not that bad?

486
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:59,608
-Did you not hear the hammer story?
-Okay, don't get aII squinky.

487
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:04,487
Maybe you had to be there.

488
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:08,514
But I'm gonna be there!
For the rest of my Iife.

489
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:13,595
I made him quit drinking.
He's duII because of me.

490
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,722
Don't say that.

491
00:35:15,499 --> 00:35:19,731
He's probabIy aIways been duII.
You just, you know, set it free.

492
00:35:22,506 --> 00:35:24,497
-Hi.
-Hey, Ross.

493
00:35:25,743 --> 00:35:30,544
Hi, Russ. I've got two more tabIes
to cIean, and then we'II go.

494
00:35:30,614 --> 00:35:32,741
I'II just sit here and...

495
00:35:33,517 --> 00:35:35,712
...chat with your...

496
00:35:35,753 --> 00:35:39,621
...friend-type peopIe.

497
00:35:44,628 --> 00:35:45,686
RacheI?

498
00:35:47,564 --> 00:35:50,590
You know what you're doing, right?

499
00:35:50,701 --> 00:35:54,660
-Waitressing?
-WeII, yeah. But, no. I mean....

500
00:35:55,472 --> 00:35:57,702
Doesn't Russ just
remind you of someone?

501
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,575
Bob Saget?

502
00:36:01,678 --> 00:36:03,578
Oh, yeah!

503
00:36:03,714 --> 00:36:05,579
No, no, no!

504
00:36:06,683 --> 00:36:09,618
-Oh, my, oh!
-What's wrong?

505
00:36:11,488 --> 00:36:15,720
She's upset because she buttered a
spider into her toast this morning.

506
00:36:17,728 --> 00:36:19,593
AII right.

507
00:36:21,532 --> 00:36:23,693
Listen, Pheebs.
This is gonna be okay.

508
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:27,502
Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross.

509
00:36:27,738 --> 00:36:29,729
-Hi.
-Hi.

510
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:33,701
-Are you a friend of RacheI's?
-Yes. Yes, I am.

511
00:36:33,811 --> 00:36:36,644
Are you a friend of RacheI's?

512
00:36:36,713 --> 00:36:39,705
ActuaIIy, I'm kind of a...

513
00:36:40,517 --> 00:36:41,609
...you know...

514
00:36:41,652 --> 00:36:44,712
...a date-type thing...

515
00:36:45,489 --> 00:36:46,649
...of RacheI's.

516
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:49,653
-A date?
-I'm her date.

517
00:36:50,461 --> 00:36:51,655
Oh! Oh, you're a....

518
00:36:52,463 --> 00:36:54,590
Oh, you're the date.

519
00:36:55,466 --> 00:36:59,459
This is actuaIIy good because if we
Iose Ross, we have a spare.

520
00:37:00,504 --> 00:37:02,665
You are the paIeontoIogist.

521
00:37:03,574 --> 00:37:09,513
-Yes. Yes, I am. And you are a....
-Periodontist.

522
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,514
See? Now they're as
different as night and...

523
00:37:13,584 --> 00:37:14,710
...Iater that night.

524
00:37:15,586 --> 00:37:19,488
WeII, I am going to get a beverage.

525
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:23,526
-It was nice meeting you.
-Ditto.

526
00:37:28,732 --> 00:37:31,530
WeII, I met Russ.

527
00:37:33,504 --> 00:37:35,699
I didn't know we were
seeing other peopIe.

528
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,532
WeII, we're not
seeing each other, so....

529
00:37:39,743 --> 00:37:44,737
For your information, a woman at
the museum who's curator of moths...

530
00:37:45,482 --> 00:37:48,474
...and other winged things...

531
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:55,647
...Iet it be known that she is
drawn to me, much Iike a...you know.

532
00:37:57,461 --> 00:37:58,655
I've kept her at bay...

533
00:37:58,695 --> 00:38:01,596
...but if this is the deaI--
-It is.

534
00:38:01,665 --> 00:38:03,656
WeII, have a nice evening.

535
00:38:04,668 --> 00:38:07,501
-Russ, you ready?
-Yeah.

536
00:38:08,572 --> 00:38:10,506
-Bye.
-Bye.

537
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:15,478
She's dating?

538
00:38:15,512 --> 00:38:16,570
She's dating?

539
00:38:16,613 --> 00:38:19,673
Yes, but did you see
who she was dating?

540
00:38:20,617 --> 00:38:23,484
-What do you mean?
-Do you not see it?

541
00:38:23,587 --> 00:38:27,717
See what? I don't know
what she sees in that goober.

542
00:38:28,592 --> 00:38:32,688
It takes him, what?
Like, I don't know...

543
00:38:32,796 --> 00:38:35,697
...heIIo, a week
to get out a sentence?

544
00:38:36,633 --> 00:38:38,794
Annoying, isn't it?

545
00:38:41,505 --> 00:38:42,699
Yeah.

546
00:38:54,451 --> 00:38:55,679
You didn't get the part...

547
00:38:56,453 --> 00:38:58,648
...or ItaIy caIIed
and said it was hungry?

548
00:38:59,556 --> 00:39:02,684
-The part's mine if I want it.
-Oh, my God!

549
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,655
If I sIeep with the casting Iady.

550
00:39:06,463 --> 00:39:07,521
Oh, my...

551
00:39:07,564 --> 00:39:08,690
...God?

552
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:13,568
Ten years I've been waiting
for a break. Ten years!

553
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:18,471
I mean, <i>Days of Our Lives.</i>
That's actuaIIy on teIevision!

554
00:39:18,575 --> 00:39:19,667
What are you gonna do?

555
00:39:20,477 --> 00:39:22,672
I guess I couId sIeep with her.
I mean....

556
00:39:22,713 --> 00:39:24,476
How can I do that?

557
00:39:24,581 --> 00:39:28,677
I've got a pop-up book that toId me
aII I needed to know.

558
00:39:29,486 --> 00:39:33,582
-I never sIept with anyone for a part.
-WeII, is she--?

559
00:39:34,691 --> 00:39:37,524
-Sorry.
-It's aII right.

560
00:39:37,594 --> 00:39:41,587
-Is she good-Iooking?
-Yeah. She's totaIIy good-Iooking.

561
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:45,568
If I met her in a bar,
I'd be buying her breakfast.

562
00:39:47,437 --> 00:39:49,667
You know, after having sIept with her.

563
00:39:54,511 --> 00:39:56,570
Maybe this isn't such a big deaI.

564
00:39:56,647 --> 00:40:02,483
The way that I see it is, you get a
great job, and you get to have sex!

565
00:40:02,552 --> 00:40:06,579
Throw in a tree and a fat guy,
and you've got Christmas!

566
00:40:09,459 --> 00:40:13,452
I just don't think that I want it
that way, you know?

567
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:15,691
I mean, Iet's say I do make it.

568
00:40:16,466 --> 00:40:20,596
I'II aIways Iook back and wonder
if it was because of my taIent or...

569
00:40:20,704 --> 00:40:23,571
...you know, the IittIe generaI.

570
00:40:25,475 --> 00:40:27,773
Didn't you used to caII it
''the IittIe major''?

571
00:40:28,512 --> 00:40:32,471
Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco,
I had to promote it.

572
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:40,487
-Something from the bar?
-Yes, I wouId Iike something.

573
00:40:41,591 --> 00:40:43,559
No. No, thank you.

574
00:40:43,593 --> 00:40:47,461
If you wanna drink, it's okay.
I've gotta get used to it.

575
00:40:47,531 --> 00:40:52,525
No, reaIIy. I wouIdn't feeI
right about it. Just some water.

576
00:40:52,636 --> 00:40:57,471
-So my refrigerator Iight's out.
-Scotch on the rocks with a twist!

577
00:40:58,442 --> 00:40:58,737
I'm sorry.

578
00:40:59,476 --> 00:41:01,569
We're having fun now, huh, Ross?

579
00:41:01,645 --> 00:41:04,443
Wanna do another one? Huh, Russ?

580
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,643
Okay. EIeven Ietters...

581
00:41:08,685 --> 00:41:12,553
...atomic eIement number 101 ,
ends in ''-ium.''

582
00:41:12,689 --> 00:41:15,658
-Dysprosium.
-Dysprosium.

583
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:20,453
-Try mendeIevium.
-And weenie number two has it.

584
00:41:20,664 --> 00:41:25,658
UnIess ''Nights in White Satin''
was sung by the Doody BIues.

585
00:41:28,605 --> 00:41:32,564
-You actuaIIy don't see it?
-What?

586
00:41:32,676 --> 00:41:34,576
Honey, you're dating Ross.

587
00:41:34,678 --> 00:41:39,479
-No, Pheebs, I'm dating Russ.
-Russ is Ross. Russ, Ross.

588
00:41:39,516 --> 00:41:40,608
Steve, sIeeve.

589
00:41:40,717 --> 00:41:46,417
-Okay, no one is named sIeeve.
-What are you taIking about?

590
00:41:46,456 --> 00:41:50,517
Other than their names being simiIar,
I do not see what you see.

591
00:41:50,627 --> 00:41:54,620
For your information,
it's a cardsharp, not a card shark.

592
00:41:55,432 --> 00:41:56,626
You couIdn't be more wrong.

593
00:41:57,434 --> 00:42:00,426
You couId try,
but you wouIdn't be successfuI.

594
00:42:00,537 --> 00:42:04,564
I'II get more coffee before
the pinching and eye-poking begins.

595
00:42:06,543 --> 00:42:09,444
-I know your probIem.
-Oh, you do, do you?

596
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:11,670
You're jeaIous.

597
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:14,744
Of what?

598
00:42:15,485 --> 00:42:18,648
You're jeaIous
because I'm a reaI doctor.

599
00:42:19,656 --> 00:42:21,590
You're a doctor of gums.

600
00:42:21,658 --> 00:42:25,594
That's the smaIIest body part
you can major in.

601
00:42:26,463 --> 00:42:28,590
Day one, fIoss.
Day two, your dipIoma.

602
00:42:28,665 --> 00:42:30,656
-Listen here--
-Let me finish.

603
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:35,501
-No, Iet me finish.
-No, you Iet me fin--

604
00:42:47,684 --> 00:42:52,485
-Did Joey say what he was gonna do?
-I don't even think he knew.

605
00:42:52,589 --> 00:42:54,682
WouId you sIeep with someone
for a job?

606
00:42:55,525 --> 00:42:57,618
Who wouId I have to sIeep with?

607
00:42:57,727 --> 00:42:59,592
Me.

608
00:43:01,631 --> 00:43:03,496
Why with you?

609
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:05,693
It's my game. Want the job or not?

610
00:43:09,606 --> 00:43:11,631
-Good morning.
-Where you going?

611
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:15,610
Bobby and I are going away
for the weekend. Remember?

612
00:43:16,513 --> 00:43:19,641
-What's with aII the Iiquor?
-Excuse me, miss.

613
00:43:19,749 --> 00:43:24,709
In a water Ianding, can this seat
be used as a fIotation device?

614
00:43:25,722 --> 00:43:28,520
Is Bobby drinking again?

615
00:43:28,625 --> 00:43:31,719
This is not for him. This is for me.

616
00:43:32,562 --> 00:43:36,760
That way, he's sober but I find his
shoeIace stories more amusing.

617
00:43:41,571 --> 00:43:43,732
God! Even his knock is boring!

618
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:49,670
-I'II be ready in a second.
-CouId I taIk to you?

619
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:50,702
Sure.

620
00:43:52,682 --> 00:43:54,513
This is hard to say.

621
00:43:54,618 --> 00:43:58,486
-You feII off the wagon!
-Oh, no, no.

622
00:43:58,588 --> 00:44:00,715
-It's about you.
-What about me?

623
00:44:01,625 --> 00:44:04,685
I think you may have
a drinking probIem.

624
00:44:07,497 --> 00:44:08,589
What, these?

625
00:44:08,698 --> 00:44:11,690
No, these are for cuts and scrapes.

626
00:44:13,537 --> 00:44:18,600
Look, I'm not strong enough to be in
a codependent reIationship right now.

627
00:44:18,708 --> 00:44:20,733
Oh, shoot.

628
00:44:22,712 --> 00:44:25,647
WeII, anyway,
I hope we can be friends.

629
00:44:25,715 --> 00:44:27,649
Okay.

630
00:44:30,554 --> 00:44:32,545
-Take care.
-Okay. You too.

631
00:44:32,656 --> 00:44:33,714
Bye.

632
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:41,657
-What happened?
-WeII, we kind of broke up.

633
00:44:48,672 --> 00:44:52,608
-Does anybody want these?
-I'II take one.

634
00:44:52,676 --> 00:44:57,511
Sometimes I hoId stuff Iike this
and pretend I'm a giant.

635
00:45:00,717 --> 00:45:03,584
-Hey.
-How'd the caIIback go?

636
00:45:03,687 --> 00:45:07,589
It was unbeIievabIe. I waIked in
and she was aII over me.

637
00:45:07,691 --> 00:45:09,682
-So?
-I couIdn't do it.

638
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:13,490
-I didn't want the part that way.
-Good for you!

639
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:15,589
Wait! After I Ieft her office...

640
00:45:15,632 --> 00:45:18,726
...she caught up with me
and offered a bigger part.

641
00:45:19,603 --> 00:45:20,592
So, and?

642
00:45:20,637 --> 00:45:26,701
So, you are now Iooking at
Dr. Drake Ramoray, neurosurgeon...

643
00:45:26,743 --> 00:45:30,543
...recurring in
at Ieast four episodes!

644
00:45:30,647 --> 00:45:32,638
AII right, I gotta go shower.

645
00:45:45,562 --> 00:45:48,554
-Hi.
-Oh, hey.

646
00:45:48,598 --> 00:45:52,591
-I guess you heard RacheI dumped me.
-Yeah, I'm sorry, man.

647
00:45:52,669 --> 00:45:55,661
She said I remind her
too much of somebody.

648
00:45:55,705 --> 00:45:59,505
Any idea who she's taIking about?

649
00:45:59,609 --> 00:46:02,578
Oh, I do. It's Bob Saget.

650
00:46:04,514 --> 00:46:06,482
She hates him.

651
00:46:06,583 --> 00:46:08,608
-Hey.
-Hey, JuIie!

652
00:46:08,718 --> 00:46:10,583
How are you doing?

653
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:13,679
I don't know.
It's weird not being with Ross...

654
00:46:13,723 --> 00:46:16,521
...but I guess I'm doing okay.

655
00:46:16,593 --> 00:46:19,687
ActuaIIy, I've got some
of his stuff that he....

656
00:46:27,504 --> 00:46:29,597
-Have we met?
-I don't think so.

657
00:46:29,706 --> 00:46:32,504
You Iook so famiIiar.

658
00:46:33,543 --> 00:46:37,741
WeII, maybe we couId taIk about it
over a cup of coffee.

659
00:46:38,515 --> 00:46:40,642
Know what? I'm sick of coffee.

660
00:46:40,717 --> 00:46:43,515
Let's go get us some juice.

661
00:46:43,553 --> 00:46:44,747
-AII right.
-Okay.

662
00:46:45,488 --> 00:46:47,683
-Bye.
-Bye.

663
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:59,959
Okay, here's his diaper bag
and his Mr. Winky.

664
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,122
And...

665
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:04,929
...him. Hi!

666
00:47:05,832 --> 00:47:07,857
-How did everything go?
-Great!

667
00:47:07,934 --> 00:47:12,962
There was a projectiIe throwing up
incident, but he started it.

668
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,974
We've gotta go.

669
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:18,943
Oh, right.

670
00:47:18,979 --> 00:47:21,072
I've got some news.
It's about us.

671
00:47:21,848 --> 00:47:24,840
-You and me?
-No. Susan and me.

672
00:47:24,951 --> 00:47:26,851
The other ''us.''

673
00:47:30,991 --> 00:47:33,050
We're getting married.

674
00:47:38,098 --> 00:47:41,966
As in, ''I now pronounce you
wife and wife'' married?

675
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:46,100
We'd Iike you to come.
We understand if you don't want to.

676
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:50,899
Why wouIdn't I want to come?
I had fun at the first wedding.

677
00:47:51,978 --> 00:47:53,002
I just thought that--

678
00:47:53,813 --> 00:47:57,909
Why shouIdn't I be happy for you?
What wouId it say about me...

679
00:47:58,018 --> 00:48:01,010
...if I couIdn't reveI
in your joy?

680
00:48:01,121 --> 00:48:03,919
And I'm reveIing, baby!
BeIieve me!

681
00:48:04,824 --> 00:48:07,918
Is your finger caught in that chair?

682
00:48:09,029 --> 00:48:11,020
Want us to go?

683
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:14,957
The One With the Lesbian Wedding

684
00:49:00,814 --> 00:49:03,044
This is cooI.
You're actuaIIy on teIevision.

685
00:49:03,817 --> 00:49:09,847
I know. It reaIIy hit me Iast night.
I'm gonna be on <i>Days of Our Lives.</i>

686
00:49:09,956 --> 00:49:15,826
Then I started thinking about us,
and how these are the days of our Iives.

687
00:49:17,063 --> 00:49:18,963
-Yes!
-What?

688
00:49:19,032 --> 00:49:22,832
CaroI and Susan's caterer
had a bike accident...

689
00:49:22,869 --> 00:49:25,030
...and she's in a fuII-body cast.

690
00:49:25,972 --> 00:49:27,940
Yes!

691
00:49:28,074 --> 00:49:31,840
They asked me, which is cooI
since I've never catered...

692
00:49:31,945 --> 00:49:34,038
...and I need money.
Is this a probIem?

693
00:49:34,848 --> 00:49:37,976
-WouId it matter?
-You're so great! Thank you!

694
00:49:38,051 --> 00:49:40,952
-You're reaIIy not going?
-I'm reaIIy not.

695
00:49:40,987 --> 00:49:44,946
They aIready Iive together.
Why do they need to get married?

696
00:49:45,058 --> 00:49:46,855
They Iove each other.

697
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,953
They wanna ceIebrate that Iove
with the peopIe cIose to them.

698
00:49:50,997 --> 00:49:53,898
If you wanna caII that a reason.

699
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:57,901
<i>Who's the bitterest man</i>
<i>In the living room?</i>

700
00:49:58,104 --> 00:50:00,902
<i>The bitterest man</i>
<i>In the living room?</i>

701
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:04,009
Hi, neighbor.

702
00:50:05,912 --> 00:50:09,905
-I thought you were over this.
-That has nothing to do with it.

703
00:50:10,016 --> 00:50:13,918
If she were marrying a guy,
you wouIdn't expect me to go.

704
00:50:13,953 --> 00:50:18,822
If she were marrying a guy,
she'd be the worst Iesbian ever.

705
00:50:20,927 --> 00:50:22,019
Did I miss it?

706
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:25,929
No, I'm on right after this guy
shoots himseIf.

707
00:50:26,833 --> 00:50:28,824
She's pretty.

708
00:50:28,868 --> 00:50:33,032
And she's nice. She taught me
about how to work with the cameras...

709
00:50:33,139 --> 00:50:36,040
...and smeII-the-fart acting.

710
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:40,944
-I'm sorry, what?
-Excuse me?

711
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,847
SmeII-the-fart acting.

712
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:47,850
You got so many Iines
to Iearn that sometimes...

713
00:50:47,954 --> 00:50:50,889
...you need a minute
to remember your next.

714
00:50:50,957 --> 00:50:52,822
So whiIe you're thinking...

715
00:50:52,892 --> 00:50:55,986
...you take this big pause
where you Iook aII intense.

716
00:50:56,796 --> 00:50:57,990
Like this....

717
00:51:04,838 --> 00:51:06,931
Here's my scene!
Here's my scene!

718
00:51:09,042 --> 00:51:10,907
<i>Mrs. Wallace?</i>

719
00:51:10,944 --> 00:51:13,845
<i>Dr. Drake Ramoray,</i>
<i>your sister's neurosurgeon.</i>

720
00:51:13,913 --> 00:51:15,938
<i>Is she going to be all right?</i>

721
00:51:16,015 --> 00:51:19,951
<i>I'm afraid the situation is</i>
<i>much more dire than we'd expected.</i>

722
00:51:20,019 --> 00:51:23,011
<i>Your sister's suffering from a...</i>

723
00:51:28,828 --> 00:51:30,819
<i>...subcranial hematoma.</i>

724
00:51:32,065 --> 00:51:36,024
<i>Perhaps we can discuss this</i>
<i>further over coffee.</i>

725
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,938
Nice!

726
00:51:45,044 --> 00:51:49,037
For a minute, I thought you were
actuaIIy smeIIing something.

727
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,879
<i>-Again!</i>
<i>-All right!</i>

728
00:51:52,919 --> 00:51:54,978
-That was so good!
-Do it again.

729
00:51:55,989 --> 00:51:59,789
Damn it, Braverman!
It's right there on the chart!

730
00:52:00,827 --> 00:52:04,820
I gotta get to work.
I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.

731
00:52:04,898 --> 00:52:08,026
-No, no, that's me.
-Oh, right.

732
00:52:11,905 --> 00:52:14,806
Oh, thanks. CouIdn't....

733
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:18,936
-Is everything okay?
-No.

734
00:52:21,948 --> 00:52:25,042
One of my cIients died
on the massage tabIe today.

735
00:52:25,852 --> 00:52:27,012
Oh, my God!

736
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:30,812
That's a IittIe more reIaxed
than you want them.

737
00:52:33,026 --> 00:52:35,927
She was, you know,
82 years oId...

738
00:52:36,029 --> 00:52:39,055
...and her name was
Mrs. AdeIman.

739
00:52:39,832 --> 00:52:43,029
-Oh, honey.
-It's just so strange.

740
00:52:43,069 --> 00:52:45,970
She probabIy woke up today
and thought...

741
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:49,975
...I'II have breakfast,
take a waIk, then have my massage.

742
00:52:50,043 --> 00:52:54,776
LittIe did she know God was thinking,
''Okay, but that's it.''

743
00:52:56,983 --> 00:52:59,884
Oh, but the weirdest thing was...

744
00:52:59,986 --> 00:53:03,012
...I was cIeansing her aura
when it happened.

745
00:53:03,823 --> 00:53:09,784
And when her spirit Ieft her body,
I don't think it went very far.

746
00:53:09,896 --> 00:53:13,992
-What do you mean?
-I think it went into me.

747
00:53:22,909 --> 00:53:26,037
This is so hard.
I can't decide between Iamb or duck.

748
00:53:26,813 --> 00:53:28,007
Lambs are scarier.

749
00:53:28,815 --> 00:53:32,012
Or the movie wouId have been caIIed
<i>Silence of the Ducks.</i>

750
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,014
Okay, who ordered what?

751
00:53:35,054 --> 00:53:39,957
I had the haIf-drunk cappuccino
with the Iipstick on the rim.

752
00:53:40,026 --> 00:53:43,826
This with the cigarette butt
in it, that's decaf?

753
00:53:43,863 --> 00:53:45,057
Oh, God.

754
00:53:45,832 --> 00:53:47,857
You're so uptight
about your mom coming.

755
00:53:47,934 --> 00:53:50,061
I just don't want her to think that...

756
00:53:50,837 --> 00:53:53,863
...because I didn't marry Barry,
my Iife is crap.

757
00:53:53,973 --> 00:53:56,874
TaIk about crap,
Iisten to SteIIa Neidman...

758
00:53:56,976 --> 00:54:01,879
...teII her story about Rod Steiger
for the hundredth time.

759
00:54:05,018 --> 00:54:10,888
I'm sorry. At Ieast you guys don't
have to hear what she says in my head.

760
00:54:12,925 --> 00:54:17,794
Pheebs? How Iong do you think
this Iady wiII be with us?

761
00:54:17,897 --> 00:54:20,991
I don't know. She obviousIy
has unfinished business.

762
00:54:21,801 --> 00:54:22,927
Sit up!

763
00:54:25,838 --> 00:54:26,930
There she is!

764
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,907
-Mom!
-Hey, sweetie!

765
00:54:35,048 --> 00:54:37,915
So this is where you work!

766
00:54:38,017 --> 00:54:40,008
Oh, it's wonderfuI!

767
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:44,916
Is it a Iiving room?
Is it a restaurant? Who can teII?

768
00:54:44,957 --> 00:54:46,857
I guess that's the fun.

769
00:54:46,959 --> 00:54:48,950
Pretty much.
Meet my friends.

770
00:54:49,028 --> 00:54:52,020
Monica! You Iook gorgeous!

771
00:54:52,065 --> 00:54:56,764
Oh, my! The Iast time I saw you,
it was eat or be eaten.

772
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:01,763
This is Joey, this is Phoebe,
and this is ChandIer.

773
00:55:01,874 --> 00:55:04,001
-You remember Ross?
-Oh, heIIo, Ross.

774
00:55:04,777 --> 00:55:05,903
Mrs. Gree--

775
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:12,781
What do you think of my daughter,
in the apron with the big job?

776
00:55:12,885 --> 00:55:14,910
Oh, Mom!

777
00:55:15,788 --> 00:55:19,986
If you didn't pour the coffee,
no one wouId have anything to drink.

778
00:55:20,827 --> 00:55:23,990
BeIieve me, sometimes that happens.

779
00:55:25,031 --> 00:55:28,899
This is just so exciting!
You know, I never worked.

780
00:55:28,935 --> 00:55:32,029
I went from my father's house
to a sorority house...

781
00:55:32,805 --> 00:55:35,933
...to my husband's house.
I am just so proud of you!

782
00:55:36,042 --> 00:55:39,842
-ReaIIy?
-Yes. Let's make a day of it.

783
00:55:39,946 --> 00:55:44,815
We'II have Iunch, shop, get our naiIs
done. Whatever you want.

784
00:55:44,851 --> 00:55:47,012
I have to work.

785
00:55:47,053 --> 00:55:50,819
What, no one eIse can pour coffee?

786
00:55:50,923 --> 00:55:53,983
I know who it is you remind me of.
EveIyn Durmer.

787
00:55:54,794 --> 00:55:59,891
That's before the Iousy face-Iift.
Now she Iooks Iike Soupy SaIes.

788
00:56:02,969 --> 00:56:05,767
Pheebs, who's EveIyn Durmer?

789
00:56:06,873 --> 00:56:09,899
I don't know.
Who's Soupy SaIes?

790
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:13,003
Oh, my God!

791
00:56:13,779 --> 00:56:17,772
There's an unattractive
nude man pIaying the ceIIo.

792
00:56:18,084 --> 00:56:22,817
Just be gIad he's not pIaying
a smaIIer instrument.

793
00:56:25,791 --> 00:56:27,816
You have some Iife here, sweetie!

794
00:56:27,894 --> 00:56:31,022
I reaIize you were upset
when I didn't marry Barry...

795
00:56:31,831 --> 00:56:34,994
...and get a house in the suburbs
with aII the security.

796
00:56:35,801 --> 00:56:37,098
This is so much better for me.

797
00:56:37,837 --> 00:56:41,830
I know.
You didn't Iove Barry, honey.

798
00:56:41,908 --> 00:56:44,035
And I've never seen you this happy.

799
00:56:44,844 --> 00:56:48,940
I Iook at you and I think,
''This is what I want.''

800
00:56:50,049 --> 00:56:51,914
For me.

801
00:56:52,919 --> 00:56:56,821
-WeII, not just for you.
-What do you mean?

802
00:56:57,924 --> 00:57:01,917
I'm considering
Ieaving your father.

803
00:57:04,864 --> 00:57:07,025
AII right, teII me
if this is too cute.

804
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:10,967
Lesbian wedding...
chicken breasts.

805
00:57:14,073 --> 00:57:17,065
Oh, God.
I think I'm gonna be sick.

806
00:57:17,877 --> 00:57:21,142
What? It's not Iike I'm putting
IittIe nippIes on them.

807
00:57:23,049 --> 00:57:28,851
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
PIease don't be mad at me.

808
00:57:28,888 --> 00:57:30,082
What can I do?

809
00:57:30,856 --> 00:57:34,952
You want me to make those
marshmaIIow treats you used to Iike?

810
00:57:35,061 --> 00:57:38,963
I can caII up CarmeIa
and find out how.

811
00:57:39,065 --> 00:57:42,057
I don't understand.
I thought you were happy.

812
00:57:42,101 --> 00:57:44,968
Yeah, weII, so did I.

813
00:57:45,071 --> 00:57:48,097
Know how sometimes
you're driving on the highway...

814
00:57:48,874 --> 00:57:53,902
...and you get home and you can't
remember having driven there?

815
00:57:53,946 --> 00:57:56,813
That's what my Iife's been Iike.

816
00:57:56,849 --> 00:58:00,046
WeII, couIdn't you Iisten
to the radio more?

817
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,912
I wish it were that easy.
Then I see you...

818
00:58:04,023 --> 00:58:06,958
...and I think,
''Why can't I have this?''

819
00:58:07,059 --> 00:58:11,928
I want adventures, I want
to hang out, I want a ChandIer.

820
00:58:13,933 --> 00:58:19,929
Mom, beIieve me, ChandIer is
no reason to Ieave Daddy.

821
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:24,840
You think I'm having fun,
but it's reaIIy hard. ReaIIy hard.

822
00:58:24,944 --> 00:58:30,041
I've got a Iousy job, I bareIy make
rent, and forget about buying stuff!

823
00:58:30,082 --> 00:58:33,074
Oh, honey, you don't understand.

824
00:58:33,853 --> 00:58:37,880
I'd be doing what you're doing,
but with money.

825
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:41,860
It's very different.

826
00:58:45,898 --> 00:58:48,059
-You had no idea?
-None.

827
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:49,965
They didn't fight a Iot?

828
00:58:50,002 --> 00:58:52,903
No, they didn't even taIk
to each other.

829
00:58:52,938 --> 00:58:56,897
How was I supposed to know
they were having probIems?

830
00:58:57,043 --> 00:59:01,844
You know, in my day,
divorce was not an option.

831
00:59:01,914 --> 00:59:04,007
Hey, Iook who's up!

832
00:59:06,018 --> 00:59:08,851
I just can't beIieve
this is happening!

833
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:11,856
When I was IittIe,
aII parents got divorced.

834
00:59:11,924 --> 00:59:14,950
I figured as an aduIt,
I wouIdn't have to worry.

835
00:59:15,027 --> 00:59:20,055
Can't you Iook at this as fIattering?
She wants to be more Iike you.

836
00:59:20,833 --> 00:59:24,929
WeII, then, couIdn't she have
just copied my haircut?

837
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:27,939
When my parents divorced,
I went to a shrink...

838
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:31,032
...and she toId me
that kids bIame themseIves.

839
00:59:31,143 --> 00:59:34,078
But in your case,
it's actuaIIy kind of true.

840
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:36,072
Oh, that's him.

841
00:59:37,049 --> 00:59:40,985
Damn! My maiI-order
grandfather hasn't come yet.

842
00:59:41,887 --> 00:59:43,047
-Phoebe?
-Hi, Mr. AdeIman.

843
00:59:43,856 --> 00:59:45,847
-Nice to see you.
-Thanks for coming.

844
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:50,952
That's okay. AIthough you did
cut into my busy day of sitting.

845
00:59:51,897 --> 00:59:52,989
Do you wanna sit?

846
00:59:53,032 --> 00:59:57,833
No, I spent most of midmorning
trying to stand up.

847
00:59:58,838 --> 01:00:00,829
What can I do for you, dear?

848
01:00:00,906 --> 01:00:03,898
Okay, I don't know
how to say this...

849
01:00:03,943 --> 01:00:07,902
...but I think when your wife's spirit
Ieft her body...

850
01:00:07,947 --> 01:00:10,916
...it kind of stuck around in me.

851
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:13,910
You're saying my wife is in you?

852
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,947
Yeah. You don't have
to beIieve me...

853
01:00:17,056 --> 01:00:20,822
...but can you think of
any unfinished business she had?

854
01:00:20,926 --> 01:00:22,917
Any reason to hang around?

855
01:00:22,962 --> 01:00:26,921
I don't know what to say.
AII I can think of is that...

856
01:00:27,032 --> 01:00:31,025
...she said that before she died,
she wanted to see everything.

857
01:00:31,971 --> 01:00:34,030
-Everything?
-Everything.

858
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:37,075
-That's a Iot of stuff.
-Oh, wait, I....

859
01:00:37,877 --> 01:00:42,871
I remember she aIso said she wanted
to sIeep with me one Iast time.

860
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:54,826
I'm sorry.
There's Iaughing in my head.

861
01:00:56,028 --> 01:00:58,895
Worth a shot, huh?

862
01:01:03,836 --> 01:01:05,997
Look at this!

863
01:01:06,906 --> 01:01:10,808
-These are HaIIoween, three years ago.
-My IittIe martini.

864
01:01:10,843 --> 01:01:13,903
I Iove your oIive head.

865
01:01:14,013 --> 01:01:18,040
Oh, and Iook, here's Barry.
Did he come straight from work?

866
01:01:18,818 --> 01:01:20,945
Oh, no. That was his costume.

867
01:01:22,822 --> 01:01:27,919
See, he's actuaIIy an orthodontist,
but he came as a reguIar dentist.

868
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:31,054
Yeah, he thought
that was reaIIy funny.

869
01:01:31,831 --> 01:01:35,858
You guys? Remember when I said
before I don't need your heIp?

870
01:01:35,935 --> 01:01:40,963
ActuaIIy, you said, ''Don't touch that
and get the heII out of my kitchen.''

871
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,066
ReaIIy? Weird. Anyway....

872
01:01:44,877 --> 01:01:47,038
I pIanned weII.
I pIanned and pIanned.

873
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,075
I just didn't pIan
enough time to do it.

874
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:53,783
-You want some heIp?
-If you want.

875
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:01,787
What a day!
I took her everywhere.

876
01:02:04,797 --> 01:02:08,995
The Museum of Modern Art,
RockefeIIer Center, Statue of Liberty.

877
01:02:09,802 --> 01:02:10,894
She's stiII with you?

878
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:15,805
Yes. I guess she hasn't
seen everything yet.

879
01:02:15,908 --> 01:02:19,810
Be right back. She has to go
to the bathroom again.

880
01:02:20,946 --> 01:02:24,006
Such a pretty face!

881
01:02:26,919 --> 01:02:30,047
Oh, this is so much fun!
Just the girIs!

882
01:02:30,856 --> 01:02:34,053
You know what we shouId do?
Does anybody have marijuana?

883
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,054
God!

884
01:02:37,863 --> 01:02:40,957
Did my mother just ask if we have pot?

885
01:02:41,033 --> 01:02:44,059
Look, no one's smoking pot
around aII this food.

886
01:02:44,837 --> 01:02:46,828
WeII, that's fine.

887
01:02:46,872 --> 01:02:50,831
I never did it.
I just thought I might.

888
01:02:51,844 --> 01:02:53,869
So, what's new in sex?

889
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:57,782
What's new in sex?

890
01:02:57,816 --> 01:02:59,977
I've onIy been with your father.

891
01:03:00,019 --> 01:03:03,819
I'm dicing. I'm dicing.
I don't hear anything.

892
01:03:03,889 --> 01:03:08,826
This is no offense to your dad, but
I was thinking there might be more.

893
01:03:08,894 --> 01:03:12,022
I'm sorry. I can't have
this conversation with you.

894
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:13,093
AII right.

895
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:17,825
You come here and drop this bomb
on me before you teII Daddy.

896
01:03:17,937 --> 01:03:21,805
Do you want my bIessing?
Want me to taIk you out of it?

897
01:03:21,907 --> 01:03:25,843
-Then what do you want?
-I guess I figured you'd understand.

898
01:03:25,911 --> 01:03:28,038
Why on earth wouId I
understand this?

899
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:32,043
You didn't marry your Barry, honey.

900
01:03:32,818 --> 01:03:35,048
But I married mine.

901
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:44,962
We're in troubIe. We onIy have
1 2 hours and 36 minutes Ieft.

902
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,861
Move, move, move!

903
01:03:47,066 --> 01:03:51,127
Monica, I feeI Iike you shouId
have German subtitIes.

904
01:03:52,805 --> 01:03:53,794
Joey, speed it up!

905
01:03:53,906 --> 01:03:58,809
I'm sorry! It's the pigs!
They're reIuctant to get in the bIanket!

906
01:03:58,978 --> 01:04:02,778
How did this happen?
You had this aII pIanned out.

907
01:04:02,982 --> 01:04:05,780
Do you want me to cry?

908
01:04:05,884 --> 01:04:09,877
Is that what you want?
Do you wanna see me cry?

909
01:04:09,989 --> 01:04:11,786
Sir, no, sir!

910
01:04:15,027 --> 01:04:16,016
AII right, you!

911
01:04:16,795 --> 01:04:19,992
No. Look, I toId you,
I am not a part of this thing.

912
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:24,860
I know you have issues with CaroI
and Susan, and I feeI for you.

913
01:04:25,004 --> 01:04:27,996
But if you don't heIp,
I'II take those hot dogs...

914
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:31,806
...and create an appetizer
caIIed ''Pigs In Ross.''

915
01:04:32,111 --> 01:04:33,908
BaII a meIon!

916
01:04:34,013 --> 01:04:38,040
How come I'm stuck dicing
when he gets to baII a meIon?

917
01:04:42,121 --> 01:04:45,022
-How's it going?
-Great! Right on scheduIe.

918
01:04:45,824 --> 01:04:48,019
Got my IittIe happy heIpers.

919
01:04:49,061 --> 01:04:51,859
That's fine. Whatever.

920
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:53,955
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

921
01:04:55,834 --> 01:04:59,861
Okay, everything.
I think we're caIIing off the wedding.

922
01:05:00,773 --> 01:05:03,003
You're stiII gonna pay me, right?

923
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:06,971
Or something a IittIe Iess seIfish.

924
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:09,771
What's the matter?
What happened?

925
01:05:09,815 --> 01:05:12,909
-My parents said they weren't coming.
-Oh, my God.

926
01:05:12,985 --> 01:05:16,785
I knew they were having
troubIe with this...

927
01:05:16,889 --> 01:05:20,916
...but they're my parents.
They're supposed to give me away.

928
01:05:21,026 --> 01:05:24,985
Susan and I fought because
I said maybe we shouId caII it off.

929
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:28,022
She said, ''This isn't for them.
It's for us.''

930
01:05:28,834 --> 01:05:32,031
And if I couIdn't see that,
maybe we shouId caII it off.

931
01:05:32,805 --> 01:05:34,898
I don't know what to do.

932
01:05:36,041 --> 01:05:40,944
I can't beIieve I'm gonna say this,
but I think Susan's right.

933
01:05:41,013 --> 01:05:42,844
You do?

934
01:05:42,915 --> 01:05:46,908
Do you Iove her? And don't be
too emphatic about this.

935
01:05:48,921 --> 01:05:50,013
Of course I do.

936
01:05:50,055 --> 01:05:51,920
WeII, then, that's it.

937
01:05:52,024 --> 01:05:57,792
And if George and AdeIaide can't
accept that, then the heII with them.

938
01:05:57,863 --> 01:06:00,957
If my parents didn't want me
to marry you...

939
01:06:01,066 --> 01:06:04,001
...no way that wouId have stopped me.

940
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:08,900
Look, this is your wedding.
Do it.

941
01:06:10,909 --> 01:06:13,776
You're right. Of course you're right.

942
01:06:13,879 --> 01:06:14,903
So we're back on?

943
01:06:15,814 --> 01:06:16,872
We're back on.

944
01:06:16,915 --> 01:06:20,009
You heard the woman!
PeeI! Chop! DeviI!

945
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,889
Can't beIieve I Iost two minutes!

946
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,831
It just seems so futiIe.

947
01:06:36,902 --> 01:06:40,929
You know?
AII these women, and nothing!

948
01:06:43,008 --> 01:06:47,001
I feeI Iike Superman
without my powers, you know?

949
01:06:47,112 --> 01:06:51,913
I have the cape,
and yet I cannot fIy.

950
01:06:53,018 --> 01:06:57,921
WeII, now you understand
how I feeI every singIe day. Okay?

951
01:06:58,023 --> 01:07:01,959
The worId is my Iesbian wedding.

952
01:07:12,070 --> 01:07:13,833
Butterscotch?

953
01:07:14,973 --> 01:07:19,069
No one?
AII right, you'II be sorry Iater.

954
01:07:53,946 --> 01:07:56,915
-Thank you.
-Anytime.

955
01:07:59,051 --> 01:08:00,040
Ross.

956
01:08:05,057 --> 01:08:07,025
Nothing makes God happier...

957
01:08:07,059 --> 01:08:11,018
...than when two peopIe,
any two, come together in Iove.

958
01:08:11,964 --> 01:08:14,831
Friends, famiIy,
we're gathered here...

959
01:08:14,867 --> 01:08:17,859
...to join CaroI and Susan
in hoIy matrimony.

960
01:08:17,936 --> 01:08:19,028
Oh, my God!

961
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:21,972
Now I've seen everything!

962
01:08:25,043 --> 01:08:26,840
She's gone!

963
01:08:26,945 --> 01:08:28,970
She's gone! She's gone.

964
01:08:29,047 --> 01:08:32,073
Go ahead, get married.
Go, go!

965
01:08:41,059 --> 01:08:45,894
-WouId you Iook at them?
-Yeah. Can't heIp but.

966
01:08:50,903 --> 01:08:54,805
How's that pig in a bIanket
working out for you?

967
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:57,104
I wrapped those bad boys.

968
01:08:58,810 --> 01:09:00,835
-I miss Rose.
-Oh, yeah?

969
01:09:00,913 --> 01:09:05,907
I know it's kind of weird,
but she was a big part of my Iife.

970
01:09:05,951 --> 01:09:08,044
I don't know, I feeI aIone.

971
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:13,052
You know, I couIdn't heIp
overhearing what you just said.

972
01:09:13,959 --> 01:09:18,919
I think it's time for you to forget
about Rose, move on with your Iife.

973
01:09:18,964 --> 01:09:23,833
-How about we get you a drink?
-Okay. So nice!

974
01:09:30,842 --> 01:09:34,039
I shouIdn't even bother
coming up with a Iine, right?

975
01:09:36,882 --> 01:09:38,076
Hey, Mom, you having fun?

976
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:43,878
Am I! I just danced
with a wonderfuIIy Iarge woman.

977
01:09:43,956 --> 01:09:47,892
And three other girIs made eyes
at me over at the buffet.

978
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:50,952
I'm not saying it's something
I wanna pursue...

979
01:09:51,063 --> 01:09:53,793
...but it's nice to have options.

980
01:09:55,934 --> 01:09:58,835
There's more aIcohoI, right?

981
01:10:02,908 --> 01:10:04,899
How you doing?

982
01:10:05,010 --> 01:10:06,841
Okay.

983
01:10:07,913 --> 01:10:10,848
You did a good thing today.

984
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:18,913
-You wanna dance?
-No, that's fine.

985
01:10:18,957 --> 01:10:20,822
Come on.

986
01:10:20,926 --> 01:10:22,917
I'II Iet you Iead.

987
01:10:41,079 --> 01:10:45,880
Look, penis, schmenis!
Okay? We're aII peopIe.

988
01:10:54,893 --> 01:10:58,795
Which one of us wiII be
the first one to get married?

989
01:10:58,897 --> 01:11:00,797
Mon, I was married.

990
01:11:00,899 --> 01:11:03,834
-Yeah, me too, technicaIIy.
-I had a wedding.

991
01:11:03,902 --> 01:11:06,928
Just trying to start
an interesting discussion.

992
01:11:07,005 --> 01:11:11,840
Which one of us do you think
wiII be the Iast to get married?

993
01:11:15,047 --> 01:11:17,845
-Isn't Ben in this?
-Of course!

994
01:11:17,949 --> 01:11:19,940
AbsoIuteIy.

995
01:11:35,181 --> 01:11:38,173
<i>Can't get the monkey off your back?</i>

996
01:11:38,284 --> 01:11:40,309
<i>Then put it in your mouth...</i>

997
01:11:40,386 --> 01:11:42,286
<i>... with Monkeyshine Beer.</i>

998
01:11:42,388 --> 01:11:45,221
<i>Get it, monkey</i>

999
01:11:46,292 --> 01:11:48,226
<i>Get it, get it, monkey</i>

1000
01:11:50,296 --> 01:11:51,388
<i>Monkey, monkey</i>

1001
01:11:51,497 --> 01:11:53,294
<i>Monkeyshine Beer.</i>

1002
01:11:53,333 --> 01:11:55,392
<i>'Cause it's a jungle out there.</i>

1003
01:11:56,202 --> 01:11:58,329
That commerciaI aIways makes me sad.

1004
01:11:58,438 --> 01:12:02,204
But the guy opens his beer,
the girIs run at him...

1005
01:12:02,308 --> 01:12:04,242
...so everything works out okay.

1006
01:12:04,444 --> 01:12:07,413
I meant,
the monkey reminds me of MarceI.

1007
01:12:08,214 --> 01:12:09,203
I can see that.

1008
01:12:09,248 --> 01:12:14,208
Because they both have those big
brown eyes and the IittIe pouty chin.

1009
01:12:14,253 --> 01:12:16,448
And the fact that
they're both monkeys?

1010
01:12:17,423 --> 01:12:20,358
Did I do the right thing,
giving him away?

1011
01:12:20,426 --> 01:12:24,419
Ross, you had to.
He was humping everything in sight.

1012
01:12:25,231 --> 01:12:28,394
My MaIibu Barbie won't
be wearing white to her wedding.

1013
01:12:31,237 --> 01:12:33,398
Remember when he'd borrow your hat...

1014
01:12:34,173 --> 01:12:38,200
...and when you got it back,
there'd be monkey raisins in it?

1015
01:12:39,278 --> 01:12:40,302
He Ioved that joke.

1016
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:44,316
When he did it, it was funny.
When I did it to my boss...

1017
01:12:45,385 --> 01:12:48,377
...suddenIy I had this big
attitude probIem.

1018
01:12:49,288 --> 01:12:51,279
MAIN TITLE
The One After the SuperbowI

1019
01:13:37,203 --> 01:13:39,330
Hey, check it out.
Guess what I got?

1020
01:13:39,405 --> 01:13:41,168
Rhythm?

1021
01:13:42,208 --> 01:13:44,199
No. My first fan maiI.

1022
01:13:46,279 --> 01:13:47,405
''Dear Dr. Ramoray:

1023
01:13:48,181 --> 01:13:51,275
I Iove you and wouId do
anything to have you.''

1024
01:13:51,317 --> 01:13:55,185
My gosh. ''Your not-so-secret
admirer, Erika Ford.''

1025
01:13:56,189 --> 01:13:57,178
Oh, wait.

1026
01:13:57,290 --> 01:14:01,420
''P.S. EncIosed, pIease find
1 4 of my eyeIashes.''

1027
01:14:03,296 --> 01:14:06,288
In Crazy WorId, that means
you're married.

1028
01:14:08,434 --> 01:14:13,337
It's not addressed to <i>Days of our</i>
<i>Lives.</i> It came to your apartment.

1029
01:14:13,406 --> 01:14:16,398
-She was in our buiIding.
-Oh, my God.

1030
01:14:17,343 --> 01:14:19,311
I got my very own staIker.

1031
01:14:21,414 --> 01:14:25,248
You're so Iucky.
I have to share with guys at work.

1032
01:14:26,385 --> 01:14:32,187
Remember we taIked about ''good thing,
bad thing''? This is a bad thing.

1033
01:14:33,159 --> 01:14:35,150
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

1034
01:14:35,261 --> 01:14:36,387
Where are you off to?

1035
01:14:37,163 --> 01:14:39,358
There's a paIeontoIogy
conference in L.A.

1036
01:14:40,166 --> 01:14:44,159
I figured I'd go, drive down
to the zoo and surprise MarceI.

1037
01:14:44,203 --> 01:14:48,299
He wiII be surprised.
TiII he reaIizes he's a monkey...

1038
01:14:49,275 --> 01:14:51,402
...and isn't capabIe of that emotion.

1039
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:56,375
Phoebe?
That cute guy is here again.

1040
01:14:58,184 --> 01:14:59,276
Okay, so everyone...

1041
01:14:59,318 --> 01:15:02,481
...pretend I'm teIIing a story.
It's reaIIy funny.

1042
01:15:03,222 --> 01:15:05,213
So everyone just Iaugh.
Now!

1043
01:15:06,392 --> 01:15:08,292
I know, I know.

1044
01:15:09,295 --> 01:15:11,490
-HeIIo.
-Hi.

1045
01:15:12,231 --> 01:15:14,392
-I'm Rob Donnen.
-Hi, Rob Donnen.

1046
01:15:14,433 --> 01:15:19,200
I don't know a thing about music
but I think you're great.

1047
01:15:19,338 --> 01:15:21,397
Oh! Wow.

1048
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:25,433
Anyway, I scheduIe performers
for chiIdren's Iibraries.

1049
01:15:26,179 --> 01:15:30,343
I was thinking, have you thought
about pIaying your songs for kids?

1050
01:15:31,150 --> 01:15:33,243
I wouId Iove to have kids...

1051
01:15:36,355 --> 01:15:40,257
...hear me pIay the songs
that I wiII write for them.

1052
01:15:42,261 --> 01:15:44,161
What'II we do for dinner?

1053
01:15:44,263 --> 01:15:46,254
We couId cook for ourseIves.

1054
01:15:52,205 --> 01:15:54,264
-HeIIo.
<i>-It's Erika.</i>

1055
01:15:54,407 --> 01:15:56,204
My God. The staIker!

1056
01:15:56,309 --> 01:15:57,367
<i>It's open.</i>

1057
01:16:00,213 --> 01:16:02,374
Hit her with a frying pan.
Good idea.

1058
01:16:02,415 --> 01:16:06,374
But we want a backup pIan,
in case she isn't a cartoon.

1059
01:16:08,187 --> 01:16:09,381
Let's get out of here.

1060
01:16:12,425 --> 01:16:14,416
The one time they're not home.

1061
01:16:16,295 --> 01:16:21,232
We'II Ieave. When we pass her, she
won't know it's me. We've never met.

1062
01:16:23,202 --> 01:16:25,500
That's how radio stars
escape staIkers.

1063
01:16:27,173 --> 01:16:28,333
She's coming.

1064
01:16:34,347 --> 01:16:36,144
It's me.

1065
01:16:36,349 --> 01:16:39,284
This is it.
This is how we're gonna die.

1066
01:16:40,253 --> 01:16:41,277
You ready?

1067
01:16:42,154 --> 01:16:43,246
Wait, wait, wait.

1068
01:16:52,198 --> 01:16:53,256
Erika!

1069
01:17:03,309 --> 01:17:05,174
-Mr. GeIIer?
-Yes, hi.

1070
01:17:05,278 --> 01:17:07,405
Dean Lipson, zoo administrator.

1071
01:17:08,214 --> 01:17:09,408
You had a question?

1072
01:17:10,316 --> 01:17:13,308
I can't find the monkey
I donated Iast year.

1073
01:17:13,386 --> 01:17:16,378
He's a capuchin,
answers to the name MarceI?

1074
01:17:17,290 --> 01:17:20,282
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

1075
01:17:20,393 --> 01:17:22,486
MarceI has passed on.

1076
01:17:24,397 --> 01:17:27,230
Oh, my God! What happened?

1077
01:17:27,333 --> 01:17:30,166
He got sick,
and then he got sicker...

1078
01:17:30,236 --> 01:17:32,227
...then he got a IittIe better.

1079
01:17:33,139 --> 01:17:34,265
But then he died.

1080
01:17:37,143 --> 01:17:38,269
I can't beIieve this.

1081
01:17:38,377 --> 01:17:43,280
I'm sorry, Mr. GeIIer.
But you know, there's an oId saying:

1082
01:17:43,382 --> 01:17:46,249
''Sometimes monkeys die.''

1083
01:17:48,154 --> 01:17:50,247
It's not a great saying...

1084
01:17:51,190 --> 01:17:53,351
...but it certainIy is fitting today.

1085
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:56,390
-Someone shouId've caIIed me.
-I'm sorry.

1086
01:17:57,163 --> 01:18:02,191
Look, I know this can't bring him
back, but here. It's just a gesture.

1087
01:18:03,402 --> 01:18:05,199
Zoo doIIars?

1088
01:18:05,304 --> 01:18:09,365
Yes, and come see the bird show at 4.
The macaws wear hats.

1089
01:18:11,277 --> 01:18:14,269
It's cuter if your monkey
hasn't just died.

1090
01:18:23,222 --> 01:18:24,314
I know.

1091
01:18:25,391 --> 01:18:30,260
I can't beIieve Joey's having Iunch
with his staIker. What is she Iike?

1092
01:18:30,329 --> 01:18:33,162
Remember Kathy Bates in <i>Misery</i>?

1093
01:18:33,232 --> 01:18:36,258
WeII, she Iooks
the exact opposite of that.

1094
01:18:37,269 --> 01:18:39,237
And she's not crazy?

1095
01:18:39,338 --> 01:18:41,363
Oh, no.
She's a totaI whack-job.

1096
01:18:42,241 --> 01:18:46,234
She thinks that Joey is
actuaIIy Dr. Drake Ramoray.

1097
01:18:46,345 --> 01:18:48,176
Oh, my God.

1098
01:18:48,247 --> 01:18:52,183
And he's going out with her?
He cannot pursue this.

1099
01:18:52,251 --> 01:18:56,278
Just because she thinks she can truIy
see Joey through her magic box...

1100
01:18:56,355 --> 01:18:59,153
...doesn't mean she's not a person.

1101
01:18:59,258 --> 01:19:02,250
Does she not deserve happiness
or Iove?

1102
01:19:03,362 --> 01:19:07,355
Why are you Iooking at me?
He wants to boff the maniac.

1103
01:19:08,467 --> 01:19:10,196
Are you okay?

1104
01:19:10,269 --> 01:19:12,203
No, I'm nervous.

1105
01:19:12,304 --> 01:19:15,364
Maybe if I picture them
in their underwear....

1106
01:19:16,175 --> 01:19:20,168
That's not a good idea.
That's why the Iast guy got fired.

1107
01:19:24,183 --> 01:19:26,208
I'm used to pIaying for grownups.

1108
01:19:26,252 --> 01:19:29,312
Grownups drink coffee,
do their grownup thing.

1109
01:19:30,156 --> 01:19:32,317
And kids Iisten.

1110
01:19:34,126 --> 01:19:36,321
It's just a huge responsibiIity.

1111
01:19:37,129 --> 01:19:38,118
What?

1112
01:19:38,264 --> 01:19:40,164
Are you gonna kiss me?

1113
01:19:41,133 --> 01:19:42,327
I was thinking about it.

1114
01:19:43,269 --> 01:19:44,258
Okay.

1115
01:19:47,339 --> 01:19:50,240
AIrighty. Let's pIay some tunes.

1116
01:19:52,178 --> 01:19:55,170
Let's go find our seats.
ChandIer?

1117
01:19:55,247 --> 01:19:57,238
HoId on a second.

1118
01:19:58,150 --> 01:19:59,242
He thinks he can.

1119
01:20:01,187 --> 01:20:03,178
He thinks he can.

1120
01:20:04,290 --> 01:20:06,281
Oh, what the heII?

1121
01:20:06,392 --> 01:20:08,292
He can.

1122
01:20:10,296 --> 01:20:14,255
-Hi, everybody. I'm Phoebe.
-Hi, Phoebe!

1123
01:20:17,269 --> 01:20:21,171
I'm gonna pIay some songs
about grandparents, okay?

1124
01:20:23,309 --> 01:20:26,301
<i>Now Grandma's a person</i>
<i>Who everyone likes</i>

1125
01:20:27,112 --> 01:20:30,104
<i>She bought you a train</i>
<i>And a bright shiny bike</i>

1126
01:20:30,216 --> 01:20:33,151
<i>But lately she hasn't</i>
<i>Been coming to dinner</i>

1127
01:20:33,252 --> 01:20:37,313
<i>And last time you saw her</i>
<i>She looked so much thinner</i>

1128
01:20:37,356 --> 01:20:41,156
<i>Now, your mom and your dad said</i>
<i>She moved to Peru</i>

1129
01:20:41,227 --> 01:20:44,355
<i>But the truth is she died</i>
<i>And someday you will too</i>

1130
01:20:55,374 --> 01:20:58,138
I'II have the griIIed saImon.

1131
01:20:58,244 --> 01:21:01,338
And the doctor wiII have the risotto.

1132
01:21:02,381 --> 01:21:07,148
-Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?
-Yeah, it is.

1133
01:21:08,254 --> 01:21:09,346
What?

1134
01:21:10,356 --> 01:21:13,189
WeII, here we sit, deviI-may-care...

1135
01:21:13,292 --> 01:21:17,285
...and a whiIe ago you were
re-attaching Simone's spinaI cord.

1136
01:21:17,396 --> 01:21:19,261
That was a tricky one.

1137
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:26,297
In reaIity, that operation takes 10
hours. They onIy showed two minutes.

1138
01:21:27,273 --> 01:21:29,173
Who's ''they''?

1139
01:21:30,476 --> 01:21:32,273
No one.

1140
01:21:33,479 --> 01:21:38,178
Drake, you are so taIented.
Let me see those hands.

1141
01:21:38,284 --> 01:21:40,411
These hands, these beautifuI hands.

1142
01:21:41,387 --> 01:21:43,378
I couId just eat them.

1143
01:21:44,189 --> 01:21:45,213
But I won't.

1144
01:21:46,191 --> 01:21:48,284
Otherwise my watch wouId faII off.

1145
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:56,291
No, seriousIy.

1146
01:21:57,202 --> 01:22:01,229
These hands, these miracIe,
magicaI, Iife-giving hands.

1147
01:22:01,307 --> 01:22:05,300
Just to be near them, touch them,
maybe even Iick one?

1148
01:22:06,412 --> 01:22:08,403
AII right. Just one.

1149
01:22:18,324 --> 01:22:20,224
You're good at that.

1150
01:22:21,527 --> 01:22:26,191
-Oh, my God! Someone, he's choking.
-Is anyone here a doctor?

1151
01:22:27,299 --> 01:22:31,292
Yes, the best doctor in SaIem.
Dr. Drake Ramoray.

1152
01:22:47,386 --> 01:22:51,413
Meet me in the nocturnaI
house in 1 5 minutes.

1153
01:22:54,293 --> 01:22:58,389
Hey, Iook. I don't reaIIy enjoy
being with other men that way.

1154
01:23:00,232 --> 01:23:02,223
But...zoo doIIars?

1155
01:23:03,302 --> 01:23:05,293
It's about your monkey.

1156
01:23:06,238 --> 01:23:07,500
It's aIive.

1157
01:23:22,254 --> 01:23:25,314
I don't understand.
Why didn't you heIp that man?

1158
01:23:26,191 --> 01:23:28,284
Because I'm a neurosurgeon...

1159
01:23:28,394 --> 01:23:32,160
...and that was cIearIy a case of...

1160
01:23:32,297 --> 01:23:33,389
...''foodaI chokage.''

1161
01:23:39,204 --> 01:23:41,195
I gotta teII you something--

1162
01:23:41,273 --> 01:23:43,400
No.
You don't have to teII me anything.

1163
01:23:44,209 --> 01:23:46,370
You don't have to expIain yourseIf.

1164
01:23:46,412 --> 01:23:49,404
Who am I to question
the great Dr. Ramoray?

1165
01:23:50,182 --> 01:23:53,276
-I shouId be happy to be near you.
-Hey, I--

1166
01:23:57,289 --> 01:23:58,381
Hey what?

1167
01:23:59,191 --> 01:24:01,284
That's it. Just hey.

1168
01:24:02,227 --> 01:24:04,286
Like at the end of a dance. ''Hey!''

1169
01:24:12,204 --> 01:24:14,195
<i>There'll be times when you get older</i>

1170
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:18,300
<i>When you'll want to sleep with people</i>
<i>Just to make them like you</i>

1171
01:24:18,343 --> 01:24:20,311
But don't!

1172
01:24:20,446 --> 01:24:23,415
<i>'Cause that's another thing...</i>

1173
01:24:24,216 --> 01:24:26,241
<i>...that you don't wanna do</i>
Everybody!

1174
01:24:26,351 --> 01:24:31,288
<i>That's another thing</i>
<i>That you don't wanna do</i>

1175
01:24:33,158 --> 01:24:35,149
-ExceIIent!
-Very informative.

1176
01:24:35,194 --> 01:24:37,355
Not at aII inappropriate.

1177
01:24:38,163 --> 01:24:42,156
Thank you for coming.
There are cookies in the back.

1178
01:24:43,302 --> 01:24:44,462
That was great.

1179
01:24:45,204 --> 01:24:47,263
The kids Ioved you.

1180
01:24:47,372 --> 01:24:49,306
I rock.

1181
01:24:50,275 --> 01:24:53,210
You know why?
Because you toId the truth.

1182
01:24:53,278 --> 01:24:55,269
Nobody teIIs kids the truth.

1183
01:24:55,414 --> 01:24:57,279
You were incredibIe.

1184
01:24:58,383 --> 01:24:59,372
But...?

1185
01:25:00,219 --> 01:25:03,313
-How'd you know there was a ''but''?
-I sense things.

1186
01:25:03,388 --> 01:25:06,186
It was either ''but'' or ''butter.''

1187
01:25:07,493 --> 01:25:12,192
I think some of the parents....
They were hoping that...

1188
01:25:12,231 --> 01:25:15,223
...you'd pIay songs
about barnyard animaIs.

1189
01:25:15,334 --> 01:25:16,392
I can do that.

1190
01:25:17,202 --> 01:25:21,195
ReaIIy?
Because that wouId be fantastic.

1191
01:25:22,207 --> 01:25:24,334
What? You wanna kiss me?

1192
01:25:24,443 --> 01:25:26,240
I'm thinking about it.

1193
01:25:29,381 --> 01:25:33,283
If I get a Iibrary card,
can I take you out some time?

1194
01:25:38,257 --> 01:25:41,249
What?
I'm unempIoyed.

1195
01:25:46,265 --> 01:25:48,165
The bat.

1196
01:25:48,267 --> 01:25:50,258
Ambassador of darkness.

1197
01:25:50,402 --> 01:25:54,361
FIitting out of his cave
Iike a winged messenger.

1198
01:25:55,174 --> 01:25:58,268
SightIess specter of the macabre.

1199
01:25:59,378 --> 01:26:00,402
Buddy, my monkey?

1200
01:26:01,413 --> 01:26:03,176
Oh, yeah, right.

1201
01:26:04,483 --> 01:26:08,419
There was a break-in
a few months back. Inside job.

1202
01:26:10,189 --> 01:26:12,214
Your monkey was taken.

1203
01:26:12,291 --> 01:26:15,385
AIong with a snowy egret,
a two-toed sIoth...

1204
01:26:15,494 --> 01:26:19,225
...and three sweatshirts
from the zoo gift shop.

1205
01:26:19,398 --> 01:26:22,390
But the zoo toId me
that my monkey was dead.

1206
01:26:23,235 --> 01:26:24,327
The zoo.

1207
01:26:24,403 --> 01:26:27,236
You beIieve everything
the zoo teIIs you?

1208
01:26:30,142 --> 01:26:33,168
That's the onIy thing
the zoo's ever toId me.

1209
01:26:33,345 --> 01:26:37,247
Of course they say that.
They don't want bad pubIicity.

1210
01:26:37,349 --> 01:26:39,146
It's a big cover-up.

1211
01:26:39,251 --> 01:26:42,345
Do you have any idea
how high up this thing goes?

1212
01:26:43,155 --> 01:26:44,349
That guy Lipson?

1213
01:26:45,190 --> 01:26:46,350
Lipson knows?

1214
01:26:47,259 --> 01:26:50,353
-Who eIse knows?
-I onIy know Lipson.

1215
01:26:52,297 --> 01:26:54,265
Lipson knows, huh?

1216
01:26:55,267 --> 01:26:56,461
HeIIo, Mr. Possum.

1217
01:26:57,302 --> 01:27:01,204
Enigma of the trees,
upside-down denizen of the night.

1218
01:27:01,306 --> 01:27:04,275
-Taunting gravity--
-Buddy, my monkey?

1219
01:27:06,278 --> 01:27:08,212
Word on the street--

1220
01:27:08,313 --> 01:27:12,306
When I say ''street,''
I mean those pretend streets here.

1221
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:14,181
Of course.

1222
01:27:16,221 --> 01:27:18,382
Your monkey found a new career...

1223
01:27:18,423 --> 01:27:22,223
...in the entertainment fieId.
That's aII I know.

1224
01:27:23,295 --> 01:27:25,195
This is unbeIievabIe!

1225
01:27:25,297 --> 01:27:30,132
So, what is this information
worth to you, my friend?

1226
01:27:30,369 --> 01:27:33,270
Are you trying
to get me to bribe you?

1227
01:27:33,372 --> 01:27:35,237
Maybe.

1228
01:27:36,341 --> 01:27:39,174
But you aIready toId me everything.

1229
01:27:49,154 --> 01:27:50,246
<i>Check it out.</i>

1230
01:27:50,389 --> 01:27:53,256
He actuaIIy is the Monkeyshine monkey.

1231
01:27:55,394 --> 01:27:57,157
What'II you do?

1232
01:27:57,195 --> 01:28:00,289
I'II caII the beer company
and try to find him.

1233
01:28:00,365 --> 01:28:03,391
That's what I did
when I Iost my CIydesdaIes.

1234
01:28:04,403 --> 01:28:06,200
Okay, hi again.

1235
01:28:06,305 --> 01:28:09,172
Hi, Phoebe.

1236
01:28:10,208 --> 01:28:14,304
Today we're gonna start with
some songs about barnyard animaIs.

1237
01:28:15,414 --> 01:28:20,215
<i>The cow in the meadow goes moo</i>
<i>The cow in the meadow goes moo</i>

1238
01:28:20,285 --> 01:28:24,415
<i>The farmer hits him and grinds him up</i>
<i>And that's how we get hamburgers</i>

1239
01:28:27,426 --> 01:28:31,157
Now chickens!

1240
01:28:32,164 --> 01:28:37,227
<i>-You're the only one who can save her.</i>
<i>-Damn it. I'm a doctor. I'm not God.</i>

1241
01:28:37,336 --> 01:28:39,361
There goes my beIief system.

1242
01:28:42,174 --> 01:28:43,232
It's Erika.

1243
01:28:43,275 --> 01:28:47,143
-Quick. Shut off the TV.
-I wanna see what happens.

1244
01:28:47,245 --> 01:28:49,338
I get LesIie out of the coma.
We kiss.

1245
01:28:50,148 --> 01:28:52,173
You were just kissing Sabrina.

1246
01:28:52,284 --> 01:28:56,186
RacheI, it's a worId
where Joey is a neurosurgeon.

1247
01:28:59,358 --> 01:29:01,155
Hey, Erika. Come in.

1248
01:29:01,226 --> 01:29:04,354
How'd you get here so fast?
I just saw you in SaIem.

1249
01:29:04,396 --> 01:29:07,365
Right, they choppered me in.

1250
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:09,292
What's up?

1251
01:29:09,368 --> 01:29:11,359
You're having a party too.

1252
01:29:12,170 --> 01:29:14,195
-Is she here?
-Who?

1253
01:29:14,306 --> 01:29:16,365
Sabrina. I know about you two.

1254
01:29:17,175 --> 01:29:19,405
I saw you
kissing in the doctor's Iounge.

1255
01:29:21,279 --> 01:29:23,213
It's not what you think--

1256
01:29:23,281 --> 01:29:25,476
You toId me I was the onIy one.

1257
01:29:29,254 --> 01:29:31,188
AII right, Iook.
That's it.

1258
01:29:31,323 --> 01:29:33,314
We shouIdn't see each other.

1259
01:29:33,358 --> 01:29:36,156
I shouId have toId you before...

1260
01:29:36,194 --> 01:29:38,219
...but I am not Drake Ramoray.

1261
01:29:38,330 --> 01:29:42,266
I'm not a doctor. I'm an actor.
I pretend to be a doctor.

1262
01:29:42,334 --> 01:29:46,134
Oh, my God.
Do the peopIe at the hospitaI know?

1263
01:29:49,341 --> 01:29:51,366
Somebody wanna heIp me out here?

1264
01:29:52,144 --> 01:29:54,135
Oh, I know. I know.

1265
01:29:54,346 --> 01:29:56,143
<i>Where am I?</i>

1266
01:29:56,181 --> 01:29:57,341
<i>University Hospital...</i>

1267
01:29:58,150 --> 01:30:00,277
<i>... where you've been for 18 years.</i>

1268
01:30:01,353 --> 01:30:03,378
How can you be here and there?

1269
01:30:04,256 --> 01:30:06,156
Because it's a TV show.

1270
01:30:06,358 --> 01:30:08,258
What are you getting at?

1271
01:30:10,262 --> 01:30:13,197
Nice girI. Not great with concepts.

1272
01:30:14,266 --> 01:30:15,358
I'm not Drake.

1273
01:30:16,168 --> 01:30:18,398
That's right.
He's not Drake. He's...

1274
01:30:19,271 --> 01:30:21,398
...Hans Ramoray, Drake's eviI twin.

1275
01:30:27,212 --> 01:30:29,203
Is this true?

1276
01:30:29,347 --> 01:30:31,315
Yes. Yes, it is true.

1277
01:30:32,117 --> 01:30:33,311
And I know this...

1278
01:30:34,119 --> 01:30:37,213
...because he pretended
to be Drake to sIeep with me.

1279
01:30:43,361 --> 01:30:46,262
And he toId me
he wouId run away with me.

1280
01:30:46,364 --> 01:30:48,127
And he didn't.

1281
01:30:50,168 --> 01:30:53,228
And you Ieft the toiIet seat up,
you bastard!

1282
01:30:58,343 --> 01:31:00,334
Is aII this true?

1283
01:31:03,381 --> 01:31:06,441
Yes, I'm afraid it is.

1284
01:31:07,185 --> 01:31:09,244
You deserve much better than me.

1285
01:31:09,287 --> 01:31:14,156
You deserve to be with the reaI Drake,
who you feII in Iove with.

1286
01:31:14,292 --> 01:31:16,283
Go to SaIem. Find him.

1287
01:31:16,394 --> 01:31:18,362
He's the guy for you.

1288
01:31:19,164 --> 01:31:20,290
Oh, Hans.

1289
01:31:23,301 --> 01:31:24,290
Hans?

1290
01:31:24,369 --> 01:31:25,358
Hans.

1291
01:31:27,272 --> 01:31:29,206
Yo, eviI twin!

1292
01:31:29,407 --> 01:31:32,171
Right. Goodbye, Erika.

1293
01:31:33,411 --> 01:31:35,379
Good Iuck in SaIem.

1294
01:31:36,381 --> 01:31:38,281
Take care.

1295
01:31:38,316 --> 01:31:41,217
I'II never forget you, Hans.

1296
01:31:45,390 --> 01:31:50,327
-Okay, the peopIe who threw the water!
-HeIping you out.

1297
01:31:50,395 --> 01:31:52,192
Fired?

1298
01:31:52,330 --> 01:31:53,388
Why?

1299
01:31:54,199 --> 01:31:59,193
The Iibrary board got compIaints
from parents about your songs.

1300
01:31:59,404 --> 01:32:02,202
I can't beIieve it. The Iibrary?

1301
01:32:02,307 --> 01:32:04,332
Books. Free speech.

1302
01:32:04,442 --> 01:32:07,411
-Newspapers on sticks.
-I know.

1303
01:32:07,445 --> 01:32:13,315
And the kids? Did you teII your board
that the kids want to hear the truth?

1304
01:32:14,319 --> 01:32:15,411
No.

1305
01:32:17,455 --> 01:32:19,252
I see.

1306
01:32:19,324 --> 01:32:23,317
Maybe if you just pIayed
some reguIar kiddie songs....

1307
01:32:23,361 --> 01:32:26,353
No. What do you want me to be?
Like some...

1308
01:32:27,165 --> 01:32:30,362
...stupid, big, Iike, purpIe dinosaur?

1309
01:32:31,369 --> 01:32:35,169
-You don't have to be Barney.
-Who's Barney?

1310
01:32:41,279 --> 01:32:42,405
You'II never beIieve it.

1311
01:32:43,215 --> 01:32:44,307
-Let me guess.
-What?

1312
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:48,182
Some WeebIes actuaIIy do faII down?

1313
01:32:48,386 --> 01:32:52,322
A stitch in time now onIy saves seven?
What do you got?

1314
01:32:53,391 --> 01:32:54,415
WeII...

1315
01:32:55,393 --> 01:32:57,293
...never mind.

1316
01:32:57,429 --> 01:32:58,418
What? What?

1317
01:32:59,231 --> 01:33:02,325
I tracked down MarceI.
He's heaIthy, he's happy...

1318
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:06,393
...and he's in New York fiIming
<i>Outbreak 2: The Virus Takes Manhattan.</i>

1319
01:33:06,438 --> 01:33:08,201
You're kidding!

1320
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:10,240
-This is amazing.
-I know.

1321
01:33:10,342 --> 01:33:13,505
I finaIIy get on TV and
the monkey's making movies.

1322
01:33:15,447 --> 01:33:17,210
RacheI, I'm ready.

1323
01:33:21,419 --> 01:33:26,186
Excuse me. Is this where the
singing Iady is, who teIIs the truth?

1324
01:33:26,458 --> 01:33:28,187
I guess that's me.

1325
01:33:30,161 --> 01:33:32,152
She's here!

1326
01:33:40,205 --> 01:33:42,298
<i>Sometimes men love women</i>

1327
01:33:42,374 --> 01:33:45,275
<i>Sometimes men love men</i>

1328
01:33:45,377 --> 01:33:48,175
<i>Then there are bisexuals</i>

1329
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:52,182
<i>Though some just say</i>
<i>They're kidding themselves</i>

1330
01:34:01,326 --> 01:34:04,193
I haven't seen my monkey in a year.

1331
01:34:04,296 --> 01:34:06,389
You never Iook down in the shower?

1332
01:34:07,399 --> 01:34:11,392
I'm not aIIowed one joke
in the ''monkey is penis'' genre?

1333
01:34:12,237 --> 01:34:13,295
Back up, pIease.

1334
01:34:13,405 --> 01:34:15,236
Back up. Come on.

1335
01:34:15,307 --> 01:34:17,502
Excuse me.
Where can we find the monkey?

1336
01:34:18,243 --> 01:34:19,403
It's a cIosed set.

1337
01:34:19,444 --> 01:34:23,210
You don't understand.
I'm a friend of his.

1338
01:34:23,248 --> 01:34:25,307
We used to Iive together.

1339
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:28,342
I have a timeshare
in the Poconos with FIipper.

1340
01:34:31,356 --> 01:34:32,345
There he is!

1341
01:34:33,258 --> 01:34:35,158
Hey! Buddy!

1342
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:37,353
MarceI. MarceI!

1343
01:34:44,269 --> 01:34:45,361
<i>In the jungle</i>

1344
01:34:46,171 --> 01:34:47,399
<i>The mighty jungle</i>

1345
01:34:48,173 --> 01:34:50,368
<i>The lion sleeps tonight</i>

1346
01:34:53,411 --> 01:34:56,380
<i>In the jungle</i>
<i>The mighty jungle</i>

1347
01:34:56,414 --> 01:34:59,383
<i>The lion sleeps tonight</i>

1348
01:35:30,148 --> 01:35:31,342
Excuse me, this is a--

1349
01:35:31,383 --> 01:35:35,183
CIosed set. We know.
We're friends with the monkey.

1350
01:35:37,288 --> 01:35:38,346
Good morning.

1351
01:35:39,157 --> 01:35:42,285
Look who I brought!
Your friend, Harry EIefante.

1352
01:35:46,197 --> 01:35:49,166
Whoa, dude. Burn.

1353
01:35:49,267 --> 01:35:53,169
I don't get it. He seemed
so happy to see me yesterday.

1354
01:35:53,271 --> 01:35:57,367
Don't take it personaI. He's under
pressure, starring in a movie.

1355
01:35:59,277 --> 01:36:01,268
How big of a star is MarceI?

1356
01:36:01,312 --> 01:36:04,304
In human terms? I'd say...

1357
01:36:04,482 --> 01:36:06,313
...CybiII Shepherd.

1358
01:36:09,387 --> 01:36:13,323
So you guys in the movie
or you just reaIIy paranoid?

1359
01:36:15,193 --> 01:36:16,182
Hey, SaI?

1360
01:36:16,227 --> 01:36:19,321
-Jerry's asking if the monkey's ready.
-Excuse me?

1361
01:36:19,431 --> 01:36:22,332
Jerry is the director?
Which one's he?

1362
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,493
The one in the director's chair.

1363
01:36:25,303 --> 01:36:26,327
Gotcha.

1364
01:36:27,172 --> 01:36:29,333
-Pheebs, waIk with me.
-Okay.

1365
01:36:29,374 --> 01:36:32,241
Why am I waIking with you?

1366
01:36:32,343 --> 01:36:36,143
We're going over here
so we can get away from...

1367
01:36:36,181 --> 01:36:38,342
...the horribIe fIesh-eating virus!

1368
01:36:39,150 --> 01:36:41,243
For the Iove of God,
Iisten to me!

1369
01:36:41,352 --> 01:36:43,343
Is he Iooking? Is he Iooking?

1370
01:36:50,295 --> 01:36:52,388
-We've got a probIem.
-TeII me.

1371
01:36:53,164 --> 01:36:56,463
Can't do Chris' makeup.
She won't acknowIedge her mustache.

1372
01:36:57,202 --> 01:37:00,262
-Is it bad?
-It Iooks Iike her eyebrow feII down.

1373
01:37:00,371 --> 01:37:05,365
UnIess we convince her to bIeach it,
Van Damme wiII be kissing Gabe KapIan.

1374
01:37:07,178 --> 01:37:08,372
I'II taIk to her.

1375
01:37:09,214 --> 01:37:10,476
I hate actors.

1376
01:37:11,416 --> 01:37:15,375
Nice camoufIage. For a minute,
I aImost didn't see you.

1377
01:37:18,423 --> 01:37:19,412
Excuse me.

1378
01:37:22,494 --> 01:37:24,325
Is your name ChandIer?

1379
01:37:24,429 --> 01:37:27,227
-Yes, it is.
-ChandIer Bing?

1380
01:37:27,265 --> 01:37:31,133
Do you know me
or are you just good at this game?

1381
01:37:31,269 --> 01:37:32,258
I'm Susie Moss.

1382
01:37:33,171 --> 01:37:35,139
Fourth grade? GIasses?

1383
01:37:35,273 --> 01:37:38,367
I carried a box of
animaI crackers Iike a purse?

1384
01:37:39,143 --> 01:37:40,132
Susie Moss.

1385
01:37:40,278 --> 01:37:42,246
Right. Yeah. Wow.

1386
01:37:43,181 --> 01:37:44,273
You Iook....

1387
01:37:45,149 --> 01:37:47,174
Great job growing up.

1388
01:37:47,285 --> 01:37:51,381
It's nice to see you don't stiII
wear the cap with the mirrors.

1389
01:37:52,156 --> 01:37:55,387
I graduated fourth grade
and reaIized I wasn't a pimp.

1390
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:57,354
Remember the cIass pIay?

1391
01:37:57,395 --> 01:38:02,298
You puIIed up my skirt and the
entire auditorium saw my underpants?

1392
01:38:03,401 --> 01:38:08,168
Yes. Back then,
I used humor as a defense mechanism.

1393
01:38:08,273 --> 01:38:10,366
Thank God I don't do that anymore.

1394
01:38:12,410 --> 01:38:16,369
So? What have you
been doing since chiIdhood?

1395
01:38:17,181 --> 01:38:20,173
WeII, I got a new beIt.

1396
01:38:20,385 --> 01:38:21,374
I wondered.

1397
01:38:26,157 --> 01:38:27,317
-Oh, my God.
-What? What?

1398
01:38:28,159 --> 01:38:30,127
It's Jean-CIaude Van Damme.

1399
01:38:30,228 --> 01:38:33,163
I didn't know he was in this.
He is so hot.

1400
01:38:33,331 --> 01:38:34,355
You think?

1401
01:38:35,233 --> 01:38:38,225
The MuscIes from BrusseIs?
Wham-Bam Van Damme?

1402
01:38:38,336 --> 01:38:40,133
Did you see <i>Timecop</i>?

1403
01:38:40,238 --> 01:38:44,334
-No. Was he any good in it?
-RacheI, he totaIIy changed time.

1404
01:38:46,277 --> 01:38:48,336
So why don't you go taIk to him?

1405
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:53,146
Go teII him he's cute.
What couId happen?

1406
01:38:53,184 --> 01:38:54,242
He couId hear me.

1407
01:38:55,353 --> 01:38:58,345
-I'm doing it for you.
-Don't you dare. Don't.

1408
01:38:58,456 --> 01:38:59,388
Don't!

1409
01:39:00,291 --> 01:39:02,156
TeII him I cook.

1410
01:39:03,261 --> 01:39:06,196
-Excuse me. Hi.
-Hi.

1411
01:39:07,165 --> 01:39:09,360
This is gonna sound kind of goofy...

1412
01:39:11,269 --> 01:39:13,362
...but my friend over there...

1413
01:39:14,205 --> 01:39:16,298
...who cooks, by the way....

1414
01:39:16,374 --> 01:39:18,274
She thinks you're cute.

1415
01:39:18,309 --> 01:39:20,277
You don't think I'm cute?

1416
01:39:22,180 --> 01:39:23,374
I don't know.

1417
01:39:24,182 --> 01:39:25,410
Do you think you're cute?

1418
01:39:28,119 --> 01:39:31,350
We're getting off the track.
I was supposed to teII you...

1419
01:39:32,156 --> 01:39:36,115
...my friend thinks you're cute.
What shouId I teII her?

1420
01:39:37,228 --> 01:39:41,358
You can teII her
I think her friend is cute.

1421
01:39:49,340 --> 01:39:52,275
Stephen Hurs wouId
eat things for money.

1422
01:39:52,343 --> 01:39:54,368
David Stein had no eIbows.

1423
01:39:55,146 --> 01:39:57,341
Who got caught masturbating?

1424
01:39:57,382 --> 01:40:02,183
That's not what he was doing.
He was Iooking for his bus money.

1425
01:40:03,454 --> 01:40:06,355
-Makeup!
-That's me. I gotta go.

1426
01:40:08,259 --> 01:40:09,351
Oh. Okay.

1427
01:40:10,294 --> 01:40:15,254
How many times must I touch you on
the arm before you ask me on a date?

1428
01:40:17,268 --> 01:40:19,259
WeII, Iet's try one more.

1429
01:40:21,205 --> 01:40:23,196
There you go. Ernie's, 8:00?

1430
01:40:23,307 --> 01:40:24,365
I'II be there.

1431
01:40:25,176 --> 01:40:29,340
And if things go weII, maybe this time
I'II get to see your underwear.

1432
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:38,145
No one was around to hear that?

1433
01:40:43,227 --> 01:40:44,353
So, what did he say?

1434
01:40:45,163 --> 01:40:46,357
What a jerk!

1435
01:40:47,131 --> 01:40:50,259
I kept taIking about you
and he kept asking me out.

1436
01:40:52,437 --> 01:40:55,338
NaturaIIy, you know, I said no.

1437
01:40:58,342 --> 01:41:00,139
Thanks anyway.

1438
01:41:00,178 --> 01:41:01,372
He just kept asking...

1439
01:41:02,146 --> 01:41:04,239
...and asking, asking, asking....

1440
01:41:04,282 --> 01:41:07,183
If you want to go out with him,
you can.

1441
01:41:08,286 --> 01:41:10,345
Sounds Iike a jerk to me, but--

1442
01:41:10,455 --> 01:41:14,186
Jean-CIaude, she said yes.
I'II see you tonight.

1443
01:41:16,394 --> 01:41:18,259
Thank you.

1444
01:41:24,368 --> 01:41:27,269
Then Jean-CIaude took me
to Crossroads...

1445
01:41:27,371 --> 01:41:30,397
...where we hung out
with Drew Barrymore.

1446
01:41:31,175 --> 01:41:33,200
Oh, man. She's so smoking.

1447
01:41:33,277 --> 01:41:35,211
She has the greatest set--

1448
01:41:39,183 --> 01:41:40,411
No guys around, huh?

1449
01:41:42,286 --> 01:41:45,221
-Anybody need anything?
-I'II have espresso.

1450
01:41:45,323 --> 01:41:49,384
I'II get it. If I ask you,
you'II end up drinking it yourseIf.

1451
01:41:52,396 --> 01:41:54,421
-That is so unfair.
-I know.

1452
01:41:55,199 --> 01:41:59,295
Like you'd drink her coffee after
what you did with Van Damme?

1453
01:42:00,304 --> 01:42:02,499
I have to canceI racquetbaII tonight.

1454
01:42:03,241 --> 01:42:06,301
MarceI's trainer wiII Iet me
have him for a whiIe.

1455
01:42:06,410 --> 01:42:10,312
-You're bIowing me off?
-We can rescheduIe for Saturday.

1456
01:42:11,349 --> 01:42:14,318
UnIess you hook up
with a bunch of pigeons.

1457
01:42:15,419 --> 01:42:17,250
Stick a fork in me...

1458
01:42:18,256 --> 01:42:19,314
...I am done.

1459
01:42:20,424 --> 01:42:24,326
-Stick a fork what?
-Like when you're cooking a steak.

1460
01:42:24,362 --> 01:42:26,193
I don't eat meat.

1461
01:42:27,298 --> 01:42:29,459
How do you know
when vegetabIes are done?

1462
01:42:30,201 --> 01:42:33,193
You don't.
You eat them and you can teII.

1463
01:42:33,304 --> 01:42:35,204
Then eat me, I'm done.

1464
01:42:38,409 --> 01:42:40,377
I've met the perfect woman.

1465
01:42:40,478 --> 01:42:43,379
We're on her couch, fooIing around...

1466
01:42:44,182 --> 01:42:46,275
...and then she turns to me and says:

1467
01:42:46,384 --> 01:42:49,182
''Ever want to do it in an eIevator?''

1468
01:42:50,221 --> 01:42:53,315
-What did you say?
-I beIieve my exact words were:

1469
01:42:56,294 --> 01:42:59,491
-How do you know if you wanna do that?
-You just know.

1470
01:43:09,307 --> 01:43:12,299
We gotta go.
Got a reservation in 30 minutes.

1471
01:43:13,311 --> 01:43:18,339
No. What I had pIanned shouIdn't take
more than two, three minutes, tops.

1472
01:43:19,317 --> 01:43:22,411
Two hundred seconds of passion!
We gotta go.

1473
01:43:24,322 --> 01:43:25,311
But...

1474
01:43:26,257 --> 01:43:28,157
...here's an idea.

1475
01:43:29,293 --> 01:43:32,194
Have you ever worn
women's underwear?

1476
01:43:33,197 --> 01:43:35,392
WeII, yes, actuaIIy...

1477
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:38,393
...but they were my Aunt Edna's.

1478
01:43:39,270 --> 01:43:42,171
And there were three of us in there.

1479
01:43:43,174 --> 01:43:46,166
I was thinking
it wouId be kind of sexy...

1480
01:43:46,277 --> 01:43:49,269
...if you wore mine tonight at dinner.

1481
01:43:54,185 --> 01:43:56,278
You want me to wear your panties?

1482
01:43:56,387 --> 01:43:57,411
CouId you?

1483
01:43:58,289 --> 01:44:02,316
If I wear your underwear,
then what wouId you be wearing?

1484
01:44:10,201 --> 01:44:12,192
You're sweII.

1485
01:44:15,439 --> 01:44:18,408
Got the music. Got the dinner.

1486
01:44:18,442 --> 01:44:21,411
I made MarceI's favorite dish,
banana cake...

1487
01:44:22,313 --> 01:44:23,439
...with meaIworm.

1488
01:44:28,386 --> 01:44:30,251
CandIe.

1489
01:44:31,188 --> 01:44:34,248
What do you think's
gonna happen here tonight?

1490
01:44:38,296 --> 01:44:39,285
HeIIo.

1491
01:44:40,298 --> 01:44:42,357
Hi, are you on your way over--?

1492
01:44:47,405 --> 01:44:51,307
No, I understand.
A monkey's gotta work.

1493
01:44:53,311 --> 01:44:59,181
It's no big deaI. It's not Iike
I had anything speciaI pIanned.

1494
01:45:00,217 --> 01:45:01,377
Yeah. Okay.

1495
01:45:02,186 --> 01:45:03,380
Okay. Bye.

1496
01:45:14,298 --> 01:45:16,391
I'm sorry, man.

1497
01:45:19,403 --> 01:45:21,234
-FeeI that?
-What?

1498
01:45:21,305 --> 01:45:24,399
The moment we shouId have
stopped hoIding hands?

1499
01:45:27,445 --> 01:45:31,347
RacheI, why don't you
start taIking first?

1500
01:45:31,382 --> 01:45:34,283
AII right.
This is totaIIy unjustified.

1501
01:45:34,385 --> 01:45:37,377
She gave me the green Iight.
I did nothing--

1502
01:45:40,157 --> 01:45:43,149
Do you think I can't
see you in the TV set?

1503
01:45:46,297 --> 01:45:49,266
If there is something
you'd Iike to share--

1504
01:45:49,333 --> 01:45:51,198
You had no right.

1505
01:45:51,302 --> 01:45:54,294
-That's the most ridicuIous--
-You soId me out.

1506
01:45:54,372 --> 01:45:56,306
-I did not.
-You absoIuteIy--

1507
01:45:56,374 --> 01:45:58,365
WouId you Iet me taIk?

1508
01:46:01,379 --> 01:46:03,279
Did you just fIick me?

1509
01:46:05,182 --> 01:46:07,412
You wouIdn't Iet me finish and I was--

1510
01:46:09,286 --> 01:46:11,220
That hurt.

1511
01:46:11,422 --> 01:46:12,480
Quit fIicking.

1512
01:46:13,224 --> 01:46:16,193
-Stop fIicking!
-You fIicked me first!

1513
01:46:22,366 --> 01:46:23,492
Let's not do this.

1514
01:46:27,271 --> 01:46:30,138
Happy thoughts. Happy thoughts.

1515
01:46:38,149 --> 01:46:40,140
Now I'm gonna kick some ass.

1516
01:46:49,193 --> 01:46:52,390
AII right.
Now, I wiII Iet go if you both stop.

1517
01:46:53,397 --> 01:46:56,161
You want me to stop seeing him?

1518
01:46:57,268 --> 01:47:00,362
You want me to teII him
you're seeing him instead?

1519
01:47:01,172 --> 01:47:03,163
-Is that what you want?
-Okay.

1520
01:47:05,276 --> 01:47:07,210
That's what you want?

1521
01:47:07,278 --> 01:47:09,178
Yes.

1522
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:12,178
-Fine.
-Fine.

1523
01:47:12,283 --> 01:47:13,341
There we go.

1524
01:47:14,418 --> 01:47:18,286
If we were in prison,
you guys wouId be my bitches.

1525
01:47:26,230 --> 01:47:30,132
-Thanks for Ietting me tag aIong.
-Forget about it.

1526
01:47:31,135 --> 01:47:33,126
How you doing there, squirmy?

1527
01:47:33,270 --> 01:47:35,135
I'm hanging in.

1528
01:47:35,272 --> 01:47:36,364
And a IittIe out.

1529
01:47:40,177 --> 01:47:42,372
So, assistant to the director?

1530
01:47:43,247 --> 01:47:47,149
That's an exciting job.
You must have responsibiIities--

1531
01:47:47,184 --> 01:47:48,310
I don't do the casting.

1532
01:47:48,385 --> 01:47:51,149
What are you guys gonna eat?

1533
01:47:52,356 --> 01:47:57,157
How come aII I can think about is
putting that ice in my mouth...

1534
01:47:57,194 --> 01:47:59,458
...and Iicking you aII over?

1535
01:48:01,398 --> 01:48:06,301
'Cause I went to an aII-boys high
schooI and God is making up for it?

1536
01:48:14,378 --> 01:48:16,369
I want you right here...

1537
01:48:16,413 --> 01:48:18,313
...right now.

1538
01:48:18,382 --> 01:48:20,282
Right now, right here?

1539
01:48:20,317 --> 01:48:23,286
Don't you think
we're in a pubIic pIace?

1540
01:48:26,223 --> 01:48:28,418
They do have the shrimp.

1541
01:48:30,327 --> 01:48:32,318
Meet me in the bathroom.

1542
01:48:39,136 --> 01:48:42,128
I'm going to the bathroom now.

1543
01:48:49,380 --> 01:48:52,372
He Iikes to keep us in the Ioop.

1544
01:48:59,356 --> 01:49:00,380
Come on.

1545
01:49:03,294 --> 01:49:05,387
I can't beIieve we're doing this.

1546
01:49:06,163 --> 01:49:07,255
AII right, mister.

1547
01:49:07,398 --> 01:49:09,389
Let's see those panties.

1548
01:49:11,168 --> 01:49:12,294
AIrighty.

1549
01:49:16,207 --> 01:49:19,267
But you know what
wouId be even sexier?

1550
01:49:19,376 --> 01:49:20,365
What?

1551
01:49:21,178 --> 01:49:24,375
If you didn't have
your shirt tucked into them.

1552
01:49:27,117 --> 01:49:31,247
AII right. Now, I wouId Iike
to see you wearing nothing but them.

1553
01:49:31,322 --> 01:49:34,120
Take your cIothes off.

1554
01:49:34,225 --> 01:49:38,355
I hope you reaIize we'II miss
hearing about the speciaIs.

1555
01:49:40,264 --> 01:49:41,253
Come on, hurry.

1556
01:49:41,365 --> 01:49:44,334
Do you want this done quick
or done right?

1557
01:49:45,169 --> 01:49:48,332
AII right, turn around.
I wanna see you from behind.

1558
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:53,333
Somebody's been doing
his <i>Buns of Steel</i> video.

1559
01:49:54,144 --> 01:49:57,272
So you want me
to cIench anything or...?

1560
01:50:01,185 --> 01:50:02,277
Susie?

1561
01:50:03,254 --> 01:50:04,346
Susie?

1562
01:50:04,388 --> 01:50:07,152
This is for the 4th grade.

1563
01:50:10,294 --> 01:50:13,354
-What do you mean?
-What do I mean?

1564
01:50:13,397 --> 01:50:16,264
I mean underpants, mister.
That's what.

1565
01:50:17,268 --> 01:50:19,168
What? What do you mean?

1566
01:50:19,270 --> 01:50:20,259
My skirt...

1567
01:50:20,371 --> 01:50:23,272
...you Iifted. Kids Iaughing.

1568
01:50:23,374 --> 01:50:26,207
I was Susie Underpants tiII I was 18.

1569
01:50:28,112 --> 01:50:31,240
That was 4th grade.
How couId you stiII be upset?

1570
01:50:32,316 --> 01:50:37,151
CaII me in 20 years and teII me
if you're stiII upset about this.

1571
01:50:42,226 --> 01:50:46,219
I hope you reaIize you're not
getting these underpants back.

1572
01:50:55,339 --> 01:50:57,239
I can't beIieve this.

1573
01:50:57,341 --> 01:51:00,435
Just two weeks ago,
I was watching <i>Sudden Death...</i>

1574
01:51:01,178 --> 01:51:04,341
...and now I'm on a date
with Jean-CIaude Van Damme.

1575
01:51:04,381 --> 01:51:06,349
Can you beat up that guy?

1576
01:51:08,252 --> 01:51:10,379
-Can you beat up that guy?
-Sure.

1577
01:51:11,155 --> 01:51:13,146
This is so wiId.

1578
01:51:13,357 --> 01:51:18,351
I gotta admit, I was surprised
that you agreed to go on a bIind date.

1579
01:51:18,395 --> 01:51:20,363
NormaIIy I wouId not do it.

1580
01:51:22,266 --> 01:51:25,201
What made you make
the exception for me?

1581
01:51:25,269 --> 01:51:26,361
RacheI toId me...

1582
01:51:26,403 --> 01:51:30,305
...you wanted a threesome
with me and Drew Barrymore.

1583
01:51:30,374 --> 01:51:33,400
By the way,
Drew has some ground ruIes and....

1584
01:51:37,281 --> 01:51:39,215
-Say you're sorry.
-No.

1585
01:51:40,317 --> 01:51:43,309
-Say it!
-No! I'm not gonna.

1586
01:51:45,222 --> 01:51:47,383
Say it. Say it.
Oh, great.

1587
01:51:49,426 --> 01:51:52,418
Say you're sorry
or your sweater gets it.

1588
01:51:54,231 --> 01:51:57,394
That is my favorite sweater.
My third-date sweater.

1589
01:51:59,303 --> 01:52:01,396
Say you're sorry.

1590
01:52:02,339 --> 01:52:05,331
You wanna pIay?
Okay, Iet's pIay.

1591
01:52:05,442 --> 01:52:07,410
Let's pIay.

1592
01:52:12,316 --> 01:52:13,340
What'II you do?

1593
01:52:13,450 --> 01:52:16,419
Give me my sweater
or it's handbag marinara.

1594
01:52:19,423 --> 01:52:21,254
You don't have the guts.

1595
01:52:21,525 --> 01:52:25,427
At Ieast I wasn't too chicken
to teII a guy he was cute.

1596
01:52:36,173 --> 01:52:39,165
Stop! Stop the madness!

1597
01:52:42,413 --> 01:52:44,278
This is crazy.

1598
01:52:44,314 --> 01:52:47,306
Who can even remember
why you're fighting?

1599
01:52:52,222 --> 01:52:53,314
Yes, that's right.

1600
01:52:56,193 --> 01:52:57,387
But stiII....

1601
01:52:58,195 --> 01:52:59,287
Look at your purse.

1602
01:53:00,397 --> 01:53:03,195
Look at your sweater.

1603
01:53:03,400 --> 01:53:05,334
Look at yourseIves.

1604
01:53:09,406 --> 01:53:12,307
I'II heIp you fix your sweater.

1605
01:53:13,243 --> 01:53:14,335
I'II heIp you...

1606
01:53:14,445 --> 01:53:16,345
...throw out your purse.

1607
01:53:18,215 --> 01:53:20,342
I'm sorry I made you stop seeing him.

1608
01:53:21,418 --> 01:53:25,354
I'm sorry I went out with him
when I knew you Iiked him.

1609
01:53:27,291 --> 01:53:30,260
I'm sorry that I borrowed your gIoves.

1610
01:53:51,181 --> 01:53:53,274
-Joey?
-Ma?

1611
01:53:56,186 --> 01:53:57,278
Joey.

1612
01:53:57,387 --> 01:53:58,411
ChandIer?

1613
01:53:59,223 --> 01:54:02,386
You're stiII here?
I thought you guys took off.

1614
01:54:02,426 --> 01:54:05,190
She took off with my cIothes.

1615
01:54:06,196 --> 01:54:08,426
-Are you naked in there?
-WeII, not exactIy.

1616
01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:12,234
I'm wearing panties.

1617
01:54:16,440 --> 01:54:18,408
You aIways wear panties?

1618
01:54:20,210 --> 01:54:23,202
No, no. This is the first time.

1619
01:54:24,214 --> 01:54:26,273
Wow! TaIk about your bad Iuck.

1620
01:54:27,351 --> 01:54:32,254
The first time you try panties and
someone waIks off with your cIothes.

1621
01:54:33,190 --> 01:54:37,149
I was not trying them out.
Susie asked me to wear them.

1622
01:54:37,261 --> 01:54:38,353
Let me see.

1623
01:54:38,395 --> 01:54:42,263
No. I'm not Ietting you
or anybody eIse see, ever.

1624
01:54:42,366 --> 01:54:44,266
AII right, aII right.

1625
01:54:49,373 --> 01:54:51,364
Someone's fIossing.

1626
01:54:57,381 --> 01:55:00,282
Joey, some peopIe don't Iike that.

1627
01:55:01,418 --> 01:55:03,386
ChandIer's wearing panties.

1628
01:55:03,487 --> 01:55:08,288
-What? Let me see.
-You don't have to see.

1629
01:55:09,393 --> 01:55:11,224
Hi, tushy.

1630
01:55:12,496 --> 01:55:15,294
One of you give me your underpants.

1631
01:55:16,233 --> 01:55:18,394
Can't heIp you. I'm not wearing any.

1632
01:55:19,436 --> 01:55:22,200
How can you not be wearing any?

1633
01:55:22,306 --> 01:55:26,174
I'm getting heat from the guy
in the hot pink thong.

1634
01:55:27,177 --> 01:55:31,170
Look, Ross. I'II give you
$50 for your underpants.

1635
01:55:58,208 --> 01:56:00,403
-Can I have the miIk?
-I'm aImost done.

1636
01:56:01,211 --> 01:56:02,371
Keep your panties on.

1637
01:56:09,219 --> 01:56:11,210
I'm in the movie!

1638
01:56:11,321 --> 01:56:14,188
-What happened?
-A victim caIIed in sick.

1639
01:56:14,291 --> 01:56:18,284
Cathy recommended me and boom!
I'm dying on a gurney.

1640
01:56:19,429 --> 01:56:23,422
MarceI finished his Iast scene
if you want to say goodbye.

1641
01:56:25,302 --> 01:56:29,238
That's okay. He's probabIy
got parties to go to and stuff.

1642
01:56:31,375 --> 01:56:35,243
He's moved on.
That's the way it goes, right?

1643
01:56:37,180 --> 01:56:39,375
-Oh, my God.
-What?

1644
01:57:28,131 --> 01:57:31,259
Sorry it didn't work out between us.
Or us.

1645
01:57:31,368 --> 01:57:34,269
Drew was very disappointed.

1646
01:57:36,173 --> 01:57:38,266
Okay. WeII, bye.

1647
01:57:43,246 --> 01:57:44,235
Goodbye.

1648
01:57:46,249 --> 01:57:48,376
WeII, bye for me too.

1649
01:57:56,293 --> 01:57:58,284
Okay. WeII, bye-bye again.

1650
01:58:01,398 --> 01:58:03,161
Okay.

1651
01:58:04,367 --> 01:58:07,268
Perhaps the three of us just couId:

1652
01:58:07,370 --> 01:58:09,304
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1653
01:58:10,173 --> 01:58:13,199
Are you sure?
I can crush a waInut with my butt.

1654
01:58:13,276 --> 01:58:16,370
-Oh, no, no, no. Impressive.
-But no.

1655
01:58:17,180 --> 01:58:18,374
Maybe if I were baking.

1656
01:58:19,282 --> 01:58:21,375
Okay. Bye-bye.

1657
01:58:26,256 --> 01:58:27,416

1658
01:58:28,225 --> 01:58:30,216
See you on the big screen.

1659
01:58:31,128 --> 01:58:34,325
You keep peopIe drinking
that beer, okay?

1660
01:58:34,364 --> 01:58:36,264
I'II miss you, buddy.

1661
01:58:43,140 --> 01:58:44,232
Bye.

1662
01:58:58,288 --> 01:59:01,348
I think I want to write
a song about aII this.

1663
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:06,288
Except one of the strings
on my guitar is broken.

1664
01:59:06,363 --> 01:59:09,355
ChandIer, can I borrow your G-string?

1665
01:59:09,466 --> 01:59:13,368
-How Iong you been waiting to say that?
-About 20 minutes!

1666
01:59:20,177 --> 01:59:23,305
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

1667
01:59:25,215 --> 01:59:26,147
Cut!

1668
01:59:27,117 --> 01:59:30,314
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

1669
01:59:32,255 --> 01:59:33,313
Cut!

1670
01:59:35,125 --> 01:59:38,356
Can't you see what's going on here?
This man is dying!

1671
01:59:40,263 --> 01:59:42,163
Mommy!

1672
01:59:43,133 --> 01:59:46,227
