614
00:48:38,878 --> 00:48:41,779
Do you think they have
yesterday's <i>Daily News</i>?

615
00:48:41,881 --> 00:48:45,647
I just wanna check my horoscope,
see if it was right.

616
00:48:46,752 --> 00:48:49,949
Oh, my God! Don't Iook now.
Behind you there's a guy...

617
00:48:50,689 --> 00:48:54,750
...who can break our hearts
and pIunge us into depression.

618
00:48:55,895 --> 00:48:57,795
Come to mama.

619
00:48:58,697 --> 00:49:00,858
He's coming.
Be cooI. Be cooI. Be cooI.

620
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,664
-Nice hat.
-Thanks.

621
00:49:03,869 --> 00:49:06,770
-We shouId do something. WhistIe.
-I'm not whistIing.

622
00:49:06,806 --> 00:49:07,795
Come on, do it!

623
00:49:07,873 --> 00:49:09,932
Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.

624
00:49:15,781 --> 00:49:17,874
I can't beIieve you did that.

625
00:49:18,884 --> 00:49:20,875
The One With Mrs. Bing

626
00:50:05,798 --> 00:50:08,665
-It's aII my fauIt.
-No, it's mine.

627
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,667
Why did I whoo-hoo?

628
00:50:10,703 --> 00:50:12,796
Was I hoping
he'd turn around and say...

629
00:50:12,872 --> 00:50:15,898
...''I Iove that sound.
I must have you now''?

630
00:50:16,876 --> 00:50:19,777
I wish there was something
we couId do.

631
00:50:22,681 --> 00:50:23,705
HeIIo, coma guy.

632
00:50:25,684 --> 00:50:27,675
Get up, you GirI Scout!
Up, up, up!

633
00:50:27,786 --> 00:50:28,810
What are you doing?

634
00:50:28,921 --> 00:50:30,889
Maybe nobody's tried this.

635
00:50:33,826 --> 00:50:35,919
I wish we at Ieast knew his name.

636
00:50:36,695 --> 00:50:38,822
I hate that they're
caIIing him John Doe.

637
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:42,765
It's so sad. It's Iike he's a deer,
a femaIe deer.

638
00:50:43,669 --> 00:50:45,728
Oh, I was gonna stop.

639
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,800
Look at that face.

640
00:50:48,941 --> 00:50:51,637
Even sIeeping he Iooks smart.

641
00:50:51,744 --> 00:50:54,838
Yeah, but the dents in his knuckIes
mean he's artistic.

642
00:50:55,748 --> 00:50:59,741
Okay. He's a Iawyer who teaches
scuIpting on the side.

643
00:50:59,852 --> 00:51:01,683
And he can dance.

644
00:51:02,655 --> 00:51:06,751
And he's the kind of guy who,
when you're taIking, he's Iistening...

645
00:51:06,792 --> 00:51:08,692
...not saying, ''I understand''...

646
00:51:08,794 --> 00:51:11,786
...but reaIIy wondering
what you Iook Iike naked.

647
00:51:14,667 --> 00:51:16,862
I wish aII guys couId be Iike him.

648
00:51:18,771 --> 00:51:19,795
I know.

649
00:51:24,877 --> 00:51:26,811
You don't even know this guy.

650
00:51:26,912 --> 00:51:30,780
Are there no conscious men
in the city for you two?

651
00:51:31,784 --> 00:51:32,876
He doesn't have anyone.

652
00:51:32,985 --> 00:51:35,681
We feeI kind of responsibIe.

653
00:51:35,888 --> 00:51:38,652
I can't beIieve you said ''whoo-hoo.''

654
00:51:38,857 --> 00:51:40,722
I don't even say ''whoo-hoo.''

655
00:51:40,826 --> 00:51:42,657
Oh, she's coming up.

656
00:51:42,728 --> 00:51:47,631
<i>When we return, we'll talk with</i>
<i>the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing.</i>

657
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:49,724
<i>Put the kids to bed for this one.</i>

658
00:51:49,835 --> 00:51:53,669
Don't watch this. <i>Weekend at Bernie's</i>
is on Showtime and HBO.

659
00:51:53,739 --> 00:51:54,728
No way.

660
00:51:54,873 --> 00:51:58,775
-She's your mom.
-ExactIy. <i>Weekend at Bernie's.</i>

661
00:51:58,844 --> 00:52:02,746
Dead guy getting hit
in the groin 20, 30 times.

662
00:52:03,849 --> 00:52:06,841
I gotta teII you,
I Iove your mom's books.

663
00:52:07,653 --> 00:52:09,848
I can't get on a pIane without one.
This is so cooI.

664
00:52:10,656 --> 00:52:12,749
You wouIdn't think so
if you were 1 1 ...

665
00:52:12,858 --> 00:52:17,659
...and your friends were passing around
page 79 of <i>Mistress Bitch.</i>

666
00:52:17,763 --> 00:52:19,890
I remember page 79.

667
00:52:20,699 --> 00:52:24,795
The thing after the opera
with the girI with the trick hip?

668
00:52:27,673 --> 00:52:29,698
I Iove your mom.
I think she's a bIast.

669
00:52:29,808 --> 00:52:31,776
That's because she's not your mom.

670
00:52:31,877 --> 00:52:32,901
Oh, pIease. She's the--

671
00:52:33,712 --> 00:52:34,974
Hi, sweetie.

672
00:52:36,915 --> 00:52:39,816
When did ''Rigatoni'' get back from Rome?

673
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,712
-Last night.
-ReaIIy?

674
00:52:42,821 --> 00:52:45,847
So, his pIane didn't expIode
in a big baII of fire?

675
00:52:46,659 --> 00:52:47,921
Just a dream I had.

676
00:52:48,727 --> 00:52:49,716
But, phew!

677
00:52:50,863 --> 00:52:52,626
Hey, she's on.

678
00:52:55,668 --> 00:52:56,828
Nora Bing.

679
00:52:58,737 --> 00:53:02,833
<i>Back to the book. What is this</i>
<i>about you being arrested in London?</i>

680
00:53:03,676 --> 00:53:04,836
Your mom was arrested?

681
00:53:04,943 --> 00:53:06,877
I'm busy beaming with pride.

682
00:53:07,846 --> 00:53:09,780
<i>This is kind of embarrassing...</i>

683
00:53:10,849 --> 00:53:13,875
<i>...but occasionally, after</i>
<i>I've been intimate with a man...</i>

684
00:53:14,753 --> 00:53:16,846
Why wouId she say that's embarrassing?

685
00:53:17,856 --> 00:53:20,882
<i>...I just get this craving</i>
<i>for kung pao chicken.</i>

686
00:53:21,694 --> 00:53:23,685
That's too much information.

687
00:53:27,766 --> 00:53:31,759
<i>Needless to say, he got a huge tip.</i>

688
00:53:34,707 --> 00:53:35,867
Oh, God, I Iove her!

689
00:53:35,908 --> 00:53:38,638
I think I'm having a stroke.

690
00:53:39,745 --> 00:53:42,646
<i>So how is your book tour going?</i>

691
00:53:42,748 --> 00:53:46,741
<i>Oh, fine. I'm leaving</i>
<i>for New York tomorrow, which I hate.</i>

692
00:53:46,852 --> 00:53:48,911
<i>But I get to see my son, who I love.</i>

693
00:53:50,856 --> 00:53:54,758
This is the way that I find out.
Most moms use the phone.

694
00:53:54,927 --> 00:53:58,863
<i>Don't take this wrong, I just</i>
<i>don't see you as a mom.</i>

695
00:53:59,631 --> 00:54:02,930
<i>-I don't mean that bad.</i>
<i>-Oh, no. I'm a fabulous mom.</i>

696
00:54:03,836 --> 00:54:05,770
<i>I bought my son his first condoms.</i>

697
00:54:11,844 --> 00:54:13,937
And then he burst into fIames.

698
00:54:22,855 --> 00:54:26,951
Let's see. Congress is debating
a new deficit-reduction biII.

699
00:54:27,693 --> 00:54:32,653
The mayor wants to raise subway fares.
The high today was 45.

700
00:54:33,665 --> 00:54:35,690
And teams pIayed sports.

701
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,657
What about GIen?

702
00:55:03,829 --> 00:55:04,853
He couId be a GIen.

703
00:55:05,631 --> 00:55:06,859
Not speciaI enough.

704
00:55:07,766 --> 00:55:09,734
How about Agamemnon?

705
00:55:09,935 --> 00:55:12,631
Way too speciaI.

706
00:55:20,646 --> 00:55:22,739
I'm famished. What do I want?

707
00:55:22,848 --> 00:55:25,874
PIease, God, don't Iet it be
kung pao chicken.

708
00:55:26,685 --> 00:55:29,654
You watched the show.
What did you think?

709
00:55:29,688 --> 00:55:31,883
I think you need to come out
of your sheII.

710
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:36,760
What is this dive?

711
00:55:36,862 --> 00:55:38,830
OnIy you couId've picked this pIace.

712
00:55:39,731 --> 00:55:42,791
Come on. Shut up. It's fun.
Give me a hug.

713
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:46,832
I heard about the divorce.
Lesbian, huh?

714
00:55:48,607 --> 00:55:53,601
WeII, you know what they say:
Be carefuI what you wish for.

715
00:55:55,714 --> 00:55:58,649
-I think we're ready for some tequiIa.
-I know I am.

716
00:55:58,717 --> 00:56:00,708
-Who's doing shots?
-Hit me.

717
00:56:00,752 --> 00:56:01,810
There you go. Ross?

718
00:56:02,721 --> 00:56:04,814
I'm not reaIIy a shot-drinking
kind of guy.

719
00:56:05,624 --> 00:56:06,818
Hi. Sorry we're Iate.

720
00:56:06,859 --> 00:56:10,727
We kind of just, you know,
Iost track of time.

721
00:56:12,831 --> 00:56:14,765
But a man can change.

722
00:56:20,739 --> 00:56:22,866
Anyone want me to appraise anything?

723
00:56:33,852 --> 00:56:36,787
WeII, I'm gonna go to tinker-town.

724
00:56:36,855 --> 00:56:39,790
Mrs. Bing, I've read
everything you've written.

725
00:56:40,592 --> 00:56:44,585
When I read <i>Euphoria at Midnight,</i>
I wanted to become a writer.

726
00:56:44,696 --> 00:56:47,597
Oh, pIease.
If I can do it, anybody can.

727
00:56:47,733 --> 00:56:49,724
Start with haIf a dozen
European cities...

728
00:56:49,835 --> 00:56:52,736
...throw in 30 euphemisms
for maIe genitaIia...

729
00:56:52,804 --> 00:56:55,637
...and you've got yourseIf a book.

730
00:56:56,742 --> 00:56:59,609
My mother, Iadies and gentIemen.

731
00:57:02,614 --> 00:57:05,606
Yeah, any messages for room 226?

732
00:57:06,752 --> 00:57:09,812
-You okay, sIugger?
-Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

733
00:57:22,734 --> 00:57:24,634
What is with you tonight?

734
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:26,865
Nothing. Nothing, nothing.

735
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:29,636
Okay, thank you.

736
00:57:32,678 --> 00:57:34,908
It's the ItaIian hand-Iicker, isn't it?

737
00:57:35,747 --> 00:57:37,772
No. It's the one he's Iicking.

738
00:57:38,817 --> 00:57:40,785
She's supposed to be with you.

739
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,778
You're good.

740
00:57:43,789 --> 00:57:48,692
I have soId 100 miIIion copies
of my books, and you know why?

741
00:57:48,894 --> 00:57:51,829
The girI on the cover
with her nippIes showing?

742
00:57:53,832 --> 00:57:58,792
No, because I know how to write men
that women faII in Iove with.

743
00:57:59,638 --> 00:58:01,606
I cannot seII a PaoIo.

744
00:58:01,707 --> 00:58:04,699
PeopIe wiII not turn 325 pages
for a PaoIo.

745
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:07,802
Come on. The guy's
a secondary character.

746
00:58:08,613 --> 00:58:11,707
He's just a compIication
you eventuaIIy kiII off.

747
00:58:12,818 --> 00:58:13,842
When?

748
00:58:16,621 --> 00:58:18,714
He's not a hero.

749
00:58:19,624 --> 00:58:20,818
You know who our hero is?

750
00:58:21,626 --> 00:58:23,753
The guy on the cover
with his nippIes showing?

751
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:25,822
No, it's you.

752
00:58:26,631 --> 00:58:27,723
-PIease.
-No, reaIIy.

753
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:30,631
Come on. You're smart. You're sexy.

754
00:58:30,836 --> 00:58:32,736
-Right.
-Yes, you are.

755
00:58:32,838 --> 00:58:36,672
The fact that you don't think you are
makes you sexier.

756
00:58:36,742 --> 00:58:40,735
Come on, kiddo.
You're gonna be fine, beIieve me.

757
00:59:00,665 --> 00:59:01,962
I'II just pee in the street.

758
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:12,699
Is ChandIer here?

759
00:59:12,911 --> 00:59:14,674
Wait. Come here.

760
00:59:15,881 --> 00:59:17,906
Okay, about Iast night...

761
00:59:18,717 --> 00:59:19,684
...you know...

762
00:59:19,785 --> 00:59:21,719
...ChandIer, you didn't teII....

763
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:25,916
We don't need to teII ChandIer.
It was just a kiss. No big deaI, right?

764
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:27,919
Right. No big deaI.

765
00:59:28,727 --> 00:59:29,887
In bizarro worId.

766
00:59:33,799 --> 00:59:34,788
You broke the code.

767
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,767
-What code?
-You don't kiss your friend's mom.

768
00:59:37,836 --> 00:59:41,738
Sisters are okay.
Maybe a hot-Iooking aunt.

769
00:59:41,773 --> 00:59:43,934
But not a mom. Never a mom.

770
00:59:46,878 --> 00:59:48,846
What are you guys doing out here?

771
00:59:49,648 --> 00:59:52,776
Joey and I had discussed getting
in an earIy morning racquetbaII game.

772
00:59:54,653 --> 00:59:57,679
But apparentIy somebody oversIept.

773
00:59:59,658 --> 01:00:00,955
WeII, you don't have your racquet.

774
01:00:01,693 --> 01:00:03,888
No. No, I don't
because it's being restrung.

775
01:00:04,696 --> 01:00:06,755
Somebody was supposed to bring me one.

776
01:00:07,799 --> 01:00:10,791
WeII, you didn't caII
and Ieave your grip size.

777
01:00:12,904 --> 01:00:15,873
You guys are spending
way too much time together.

778
01:00:18,877 --> 01:00:20,708
I'm scum. I'm scum.

779
01:00:20,812 --> 01:00:22,905
-How couId you Iet this happen?
-I don't know.

780
01:00:23,715 --> 01:00:25,683
It's not Iike she's a reguIar mom.

781
01:00:25,784 --> 01:00:27,684
She's sexy. She's....

782
01:00:27,786 --> 01:00:29,811
You don't think my mom's sexy?

783
01:00:30,922 --> 01:00:33,789
WeII, not in the same way.

784
01:00:33,892 --> 01:00:37,828
I'II have you know, GIoria Tribbiani
was a handsome woman in her day.

785
01:00:39,631 --> 01:00:42,725
You think it's easy giving birth
to seven chiIdren?

786
01:00:44,736 --> 01:00:47,728
Okay, I think we're getting
into a weird area here.

787
01:00:49,841 --> 01:00:51,638
What are you doing here?

788
01:00:52,844 --> 01:00:54,744
Not pIaying racquetbaII.

789
01:00:56,848 --> 01:01:00,841
-He forgot to Ieave his grip size.
-He didn't get the goggIes.

790
01:01:02,888 --> 01:01:05,686
Sounds Iike you two have issues.

791
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:09,784
Goodbye, baby.

792
01:01:11,963 --> 01:01:14,693
Do they wait for me to do this?

793
01:01:20,772 --> 01:01:23,764
-Are you gonna teII him?
-Why wouId I teII him?

794
01:01:23,875 --> 01:01:26,673
If you don't, his mother might.

795
01:01:27,779 --> 01:01:29,872
What are you guys doing here?

796
01:01:30,782 --> 01:01:32,875
He's not even wearing a jock strap.

797
01:01:38,657 --> 01:01:40,648
What did I ask?

798
01:01:54,839 --> 01:01:56,670
What are you doing here?

799
01:01:56,741 --> 01:01:59,767
Nothing. I just thought
I'd stop by, you know, after...

800
01:01:59,878 --> 01:02:01,641
...that I, you know.

801
01:02:01,746 --> 01:02:03,646
So, what are you doing here?

802
01:02:04,683 --> 01:02:06,651
I'm not reaIIy here.

803
01:02:06,751 --> 01:02:10,847
I just thought I'd drop these off
on the way. My way.

804
01:02:13,692 --> 01:02:16,661
Do you come here a Iot...

805
01:02:16,895 --> 01:02:18,658
...without me?

806
01:02:18,763 --> 01:02:20,754
No, no, no.

807
01:02:23,868 --> 01:02:27,668
Do you think he's doing any better
than he was this morning?

808
01:02:28,873 --> 01:02:31,671
How wouId I know? I wasn't here.

809
01:02:31,776 --> 01:02:34,870
ReaIIy? Not even
to change his pajamas?

810
01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:39,817
Oh, my God.

811
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:42,814
You're my friend.
I had to teII you.

812
01:02:43,622 --> 01:02:44,816
I can't beIieve it.

813
01:02:45,824 --> 01:02:47,621
PaoIo kissed my mom?

814
01:02:48,727 --> 01:02:51,753
I don't know if you noticed,
but he drank a Iot.

815
01:02:51,863 --> 01:02:54,730
I mean, you know how he gets--

816
01:02:56,735 --> 01:02:58,669
I can't do this. I did it.

817
01:02:58,770 --> 01:03:00,863
It was me. I'm sorry.
I kissed your mom.

818
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:02,729
What?

819
01:03:02,941 --> 01:03:07,844
I was upset about RacheI and
I had too much tequiIa, and Nora...

820
01:03:08,647 --> 01:03:09,841
...Mrs. Mom, your Bing, was...

821
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:14,648
...being nice.
But nothing happened.

822
01:03:14,753 --> 01:03:15,742
Nothing. Ask Joey.

823
01:03:15,887 --> 01:03:18,856
-Joey came in--
-You knew about this?

824
01:03:19,658 --> 01:03:21,853
You know, knowIedge is a tricky thing.

825
01:03:22,794 --> 01:03:24,887
Why didn't you teII me?

826
01:03:25,697 --> 01:03:28,894
You're Iucky I caught them, or eIse
who knows what wouId've happened?

827
01:03:29,701 --> 01:03:30,793
Thanks, man. Big heIp.

828
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:33,761
What the heII were you thinking?

829
01:03:33,872 --> 01:03:35,863
I wasn't. I don't know. I--

830
01:03:35,907 --> 01:03:39,638
No one knows the crap I go through
with my mom more than you.

831
01:03:39,711 --> 01:03:41,736
-I know.
-I can't beIieve you did this.

832
01:03:41,846 --> 01:03:44,610
-Me neither.
-I'm mad at you too.

833
01:03:44,716 --> 01:03:47,617
-Why are you mad at me--?
-Let me sIam the door.

834
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:52,713
I didn't kiss her. See what happens
when you break the code?

835
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:08,862
''<i>A Woman Undone,</i>
by RacheI IKaren Greene.''

836
01:04:09,641 --> 01:04:12,735
I thought I'd give it a shot.
I'm on the first chapter.

837
01:04:12,844 --> 01:04:17,838
Do you think his ''Iove stick'' can be
''Iiberated from its denim prison''?

838
01:04:19,751 --> 01:04:21,776
Yeah, I'd say so.

839
01:04:21,953 --> 01:04:25,650
And there's no ''J'' in ''engorged.''

840
01:04:30,795 --> 01:04:33,662
-You going to the hospitaI tonight?
-No. You?

841
01:04:33,865 --> 01:04:34,889
No. You?

842
01:04:37,736 --> 01:04:39,727
You just asked me.

843
01:04:39,804 --> 01:04:41,795
Maybe it was a trick question.

844
01:04:43,742 --> 01:04:45,835
RacheI, can we do this now?

845
01:04:47,812 --> 01:04:49,803
I am so hot.

846
01:04:51,716 --> 01:04:54,651
Here's my mom and dad
on their wedding day.

847
01:04:54,753 --> 01:04:57,745
Now, you teII me she's not a knockout.

848
01:04:59,624 --> 01:05:04,926
-I can't beIieve this conversation.
-Just try to picture her not pregnant.

849
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:10,733
CentraI Perk is proud to present
Miss Phoebe Buffay.

850
01:05:11,770 --> 01:05:12,737
Thanks.

851
01:05:14,839 --> 01:05:19,742
I'd Iike to start with a song
about a man I recentIy met...

852
01:05:19,844 --> 01:05:22,779
...who's come to be
very important to me.

853
01:05:27,886 --> 01:05:31,788
<i>You don't have to be awake</i>
<i>To be my man</i>

854
01:05:33,892 --> 01:05:38,795
<i>Long as you have brain waves</i>
<i>I'll be there to hold your hand</i>

855
01:05:40,632 --> 01:05:42,657
<i>Though we just met the other day</i>

856
01:05:42,801 --> 01:05:46,601
<i>There's something I have got to say</i>

857
01:05:47,639 --> 01:05:50,608
Thank you very much.
I'm gonna take a short break.

858
01:05:52,811 --> 01:05:56,611
That was Phoebe Buffay, everybody.

859
01:05:57,682 --> 01:06:00,617
-What the heII was that?
-Phoebe just started--

860
01:06:00,685 --> 01:06:04,746
I was taIking to Joey.
AII right, there, mother-kisser?

861
01:06:09,694 --> 01:06:10,820
''Mother-kisser.''

862
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:13,754
I'II shut up.

863
01:06:13,865 --> 01:06:16,698
I know you're stiII mad at me...

864
01:06:16,768 --> 01:06:19,703
...but there were two peopIe
there that night.

865
01:06:19,871 --> 01:06:22,863
-There were two sets of Iips.
-I expect this from her.

866
01:06:23,741 --> 01:06:25,868
She's aIways been a Freudian nightmare.

867
01:06:26,644 --> 01:06:29,670
Then why don't you say something?

868
01:06:29,747 --> 01:06:32,716
Because it's compIicated.
It's compIex.

869
01:06:32,851 --> 01:06:34,648
You kissed my mom.

870
01:06:37,889 --> 01:06:40,585
We're rehearsing a Greek pIay.

871
01:06:41,726 --> 01:06:43,660
That's funny.
Are we done now?

872
01:06:43,728 --> 01:06:46,788
You mean you're not gonna
teII her how you feeI?

873
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:50,625
Just because you pIayed
tonsiI tennis with my mom...

874
01:06:50,702 --> 01:06:53,728
...doesn't mean you know her.
You can't taIk to her.

875
01:06:53,838 --> 01:06:56,602
Okay. ''You can't''?
Or you can't?

876
01:06:57,742 --> 01:06:58,834
Okay, that's my finger.

877
01:06:59,644 --> 01:07:01,805
Okay, that's my knee.

878
01:07:02,614 --> 01:07:03,706
StiII doing the pIay.

879
01:07:12,624 --> 01:07:13,750
What did you do with him?

880
01:07:17,862 --> 01:07:19,830
-You're awake.
-Look at you.

881
01:07:20,632 --> 01:07:21,860
How do you feeI?

882
01:07:22,667 --> 01:07:24,658
A IittIe woozy, but basicaIIy okay.

883
01:07:24,736 --> 01:07:26,727
Gosh, you Iook good.

884
01:07:26,771 --> 01:07:27,863
I feeI good.

885
01:07:29,674 --> 01:07:30,834
Who are you?

886
01:07:30,875 --> 01:07:32,775
-Sorry.
-I'm Phoebe.

887
01:07:32,844 --> 01:07:35,677
I'm Monica.
I've been caring for you.

888
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:36,747
We both have.

889
01:07:36,881 --> 01:07:39,782
-The Etch A Sketch is from you?
-ActuaIIy, me.

890
01:07:40,585 --> 01:07:42,780
-I got you the foot massager.
-I shaved you.

891
01:07:42,887 --> 01:07:45,617
-I read to you.
-I sang.

892
01:07:47,692 --> 01:07:48,784
WeII, thanks.

893
01:07:49,594 --> 01:07:51,687
-Oh, my pIeasure.
-You're weIcome.

894
01:07:51,729 --> 01:07:54,698
So I guess I'II see you around.

895
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,700
What? That's it?

896
01:07:58,603 --> 01:07:59,729
''See you around''?

897
01:07:59,837 --> 01:08:02,829
-What do you want me to say?
-I don't know.

898
01:08:03,641 --> 01:08:04,699
Maybe...

899
01:08:04,809 --> 01:08:06,606
...''That was nice.''

900
01:08:06,711 --> 01:08:07,803
''It meant something to me.''

901
01:08:08,846 --> 01:08:10,711
''I'II caII you.''

902
01:08:11,749 --> 01:08:14,843
-Okay. I'II caII you.
-I don't think you mean that.

903
01:08:18,656 --> 01:08:20,624
This is so typicaI.

904
01:08:20,758 --> 01:08:23,625
You know, we give and we give...

905
01:08:23,728 --> 01:08:24,922
...and we give.

906
01:08:25,663 --> 01:08:27,722
And we just get nothing back.

907
01:08:27,765 --> 01:08:31,724
And then one day, you wake up,
and it's, ''See you around.''

908
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:35,635
Let's go, Phoebe.

909
01:08:37,675 --> 01:08:40,769
You know what?
We thought you were different.

910
01:08:40,845 --> 01:08:42,938
But I guess it was just the coma.

911
01:08:53,758 --> 01:08:57,751
The car's waiting. I just wanted
to drop off my book for your friends.

912
01:08:57,795 --> 01:09:01,697
Autographed.
And give you a goodbye kiss.

913
01:09:01,799 --> 01:09:04,768
Here's the kiss,
here's the goodbye....

914
01:09:04,902 --> 01:09:09,703
-Anything you want from Lisbon?
-Just knowing you're there is enough.

915
01:09:09,874 --> 01:09:13,674
AII right. WeII, be good.
I Iove you.

916
01:09:16,714 --> 01:09:18,807
You kissed my best Ross.

917
01:09:20,885 --> 01:09:23,683
Or something to that effect.

918
01:09:29,794 --> 01:09:31,728
Look, it was stupid.

919
01:09:31,796 --> 01:09:33,821
-ReaIIy stupid.
-ReaIIy stupid.

920
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,662
I don't even know how it happened.

921
01:09:38,836 --> 01:09:43,671
I'm sorry, honey. I promise
it wiII never happen again.

922
01:09:43,775 --> 01:09:45,675
ReaIIy, reaIIy stupid.

923
01:09:45,777 --> 01:09:47,870
ReaIIy, reaIIy stupid.

924
01:09:49,647 --> 01:09:51,774
-Are we okay now?
-Yeah.

925
01:09:51,949 --> 01:09:53,644
No.

926
01:09:58,756 --> 01:10:01,782
The forbidden Iove
of a man and his door.

927
01:10:03,761 --> 01:10:06,855
He toId her off. And not just
about the kiss.

928
01:10:06,898 --> 01:10:07,887
You're kidding?

929
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:11,794
He said, ''When are you gonna
start being a mom?''

930
01:10:11,869 --> 01:10:12,893
Then she said:

931
01:10:13,705 --> 01:10:17,801
''The question is, when are you gonna
reaIize I have a bomb?''

932
01:10:19,877 --> 01:10:21,811
Are you sure she didn't say:

933
01:10:21,879 --> 01:10:26,816
''When are you gonna grow up
and reaIize I am your mom?''

934
01:10:28,986 --> 01:10:31,887
-That makes more sense.
-You think?

935
01:10:33,725 --> 01:10:34,817
What's going on now?

936
01:10:35,727 --> 01:10:39,629
I don't know. I've been standing here
speIIing it out for you.

937
01:10:40,832 --> 01:10:42,732
I don't hear anything. Wait.

938
01:10:42,834 --> 01:10:43,823
What do you see?

939
01:10:44,635 --> 01:10:46,728
It's hard to teII.
They're tiny and upside down.

940
01:10:46,838 --> 01:10:47,862
Wait, wait, wait.

941
01:10:48,673 --> 01:10:51,665
They're waIking away.
They're waIking away.

942
01:10:51,876 --> 01:10:55,744
No, they're not. They're coming
right at us. Run!

943
01:10:57,882 --> 01:11:00,749
-Are you okay, kiddo?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

944
01:11:00,852 --> 01:11:02,752
AII right. You be good.

945
01:11:02,854 --> 01:11:04,685
Drive safe.

946
01:11:06,691 --> 01:11:08,750
-Mrs. Bing.
-Mr. GeIIer.

947
01:11:17,769 --> 01:11:18,861
You mean that?

948
01:11:19,804 --> 01:11:20,896
Yeah, why not?

949
01:11:23,775 --> 01:11:25,766
So I toId her.

950
01:11:25,877 --> 01:11:27,811
-How did it go?
-AwfuI. AwfuI.

951
01:11:27,979 --> 01:11:29,810
CouIdn't have gone worse.

952
01:11:30,882 --> 01:11:33,783
-WeII, how do you feeI?
-Pretty good.

953
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:36,878
I toId her.

954
01:11:37,655 --> 01:11:38,849
WeII, see?

955
01:11:39,657 --> 01:11:43,718
So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea,
me kissing your mom, huh?

956
01:11:43,828 --> 01:11:46,854
But we don't have to
go down that road.

957
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:54,861
This is just the first chapter...

958
01:11:55,673 --> 01:11:59,837
...and I want your absoIute
honest opinion. Okay?

959
01:12:00,745 --> 01:12:04,738
And on page two, he's not reaching
for her ''heaving beasts.''

960
01:12:06,651 --> 01:12:07,948
She couId have heaving beasts.

961
01:12:08,853 --> 01:12:11,845
Right, but in this case she doesn't.

962
01:12:12,757 --> 01:12:13,746
What's a ''niffIe''?

963
01:12:13,858 --> 01:12:16,793
You can usuaIIy find them
on the heaving beasts.

964
01:12:18,863 --> 01:12:20,888
Okay, so I'm not a great typist.

965
01:12:21,699 --> 01:12:25,692
Did you get to the part
about his ''huge, throbbing pens''?

966
01:12:25,903 --> 01:12:29,862
You don't wanna be around
when he starts writing with those.

967
01:12:30,808 --> 01:12:32,799
That's it. Give them back.

968
01:12:33,711 --> 01:12:37,841
Wait, I just got to the part
about her ''pubIic hair.''
