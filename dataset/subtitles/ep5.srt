1
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,438
Man, I sure miss JuIie.

2
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:11,305
Spanish midgets.

3
00:00:11,348 --> 00:00:15,216
Spanish midgets wrestIing...

4
00:00:15,318 --> 00:00:18,310
...JuIie!
Okay, I see how you got there.

5
00:00:24,227 --> 00:00:26,525
You ever figure out
what that thing's for?

6
00:00:27,263 --> 00:00:28,525
I'm trying to screen.

7
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:33,224
If I answer the phone,
peopIe wiII think I have no Iife.

8
00:00:33,336 --> 00:00:35,327
My God!
Rodrigo is never pinned!

9
00:00:35,438 --> 00:00:38,271
<i>After the beep,</i>
<i>you know what to do.</i>

10
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:40,275
<i>Hello. I'm looking for Bob.</i>

11
00:00:40,377 --> 00:00:43,346
<i>It's Jade.</i>
<i>If this is still your number....</i>

12
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:48,374
<i>I was thinking about how great it was.</i>
<i>I know it's been three years...</i>

13
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:52,478
<i>...but I was hoping</i>
<i>we could hook up again.</i>

14
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:55,280
<i>I barely had the nerve</i>
<i>to call...</i>

15
00:00:55,392 --> 00:00:57,451
<i>-...so you know what I did?</i>.
-What?

16
00:00:57,494 --> 00:00:59,485
<i>I got a little drunk...</i>

17
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,197
<i>...and naked.</i>

18
00:01:01,297 --> 00:01:03,231
Bob here!

19
00:01:05,201 --> 00:01:07,192
The One With Five Steaks And An EggpIant

20
00:01:52,382 --> 00:01:55,374
So, what have you been up to?

21
00:01:55,452 --> 00:01:57,386
<i>Oh, you know, the usual.</i>

22
00:01:57,454 --> 00:01:59,251
<i>Teaching aerobics...</i>

23
00:01:59,556 --> 00:02:02,286
<i>...partying way too much.</i>

24
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:04,190
<i>And in case you wondered...</i>

25
00:02:04,294 --> 00:02:08,355
<i>...those are my legs on</i>
<i>the new</i> James Bond <i>poster.</i>

26
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:13,394
Can you hoId on?
I have another caII.

27
00:02:14,204 --> 00:02:15,364
-I Iove her!
-I know.

28
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:19,437
-I'm back.
<i>-So are we gonna get together?</i>

29
00:02:20,243 --> 00:02:23,337
AbsoIuteIy.
How about tomorrow afternoon?

30
00:02:23,446 --> 00:02:26,313
Do you know CentraI Perk?
5-ish?

31
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:31,218
<i>-Great. I'll see you then.</i>
-Okay.

32
00:02:31,254 --> 00:02:32,448
Okay.

33
00:02:33,256 --> 00:02:36,419
Having a phone has finaIIy paid off.

34
00:02:37,427 --> 00:02:40,225
You do a good Bob impression...

35
00:02:40,263 --> 00:02:41,457
...but when she sees you...

36
00:02:42,265 --> 00:02:45,325
...she may reaIize that,
hey, you're not Bob.

37
00:02:45,435 --> 00:02:48,268
You see Tattoo....

38
00:02:48,471 --> 00:02:52,373
Jade's fantasy is to rekindIe
the Iove she had with Bob.

39
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:56,468
My fantasy is that you
taIk Iike a normaI person.

40
00:02:57,247 --> 00:02:58,475
I hope when
he doesn't show...

41
00:02:59,249 --> 00:03:04,209
...she'II seek comfort in the open arms
of the wry stranger at the next tabIe.

42
00:03:04,287 --> 00:03:07,381
Oh, my God.
You are pure eviI.

43
00:03:08,324 --> 00:03:10,383
Okay, pure eviI...

44
00:03:11,194 --> 00:03:13,185
...horny and aIone.

45
00:03:15,331 --> 00:03:17,322
I've done this.

46
00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:26,207
Yeah, everybody's here.

47
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:28,402
Say hi to JuIie in New Mexico!

48
00:03:28,444 --> 00:03:29,433
Hi, JuIie!

49
00:03:30,246 --> 00:03:33,306
Hi, JuIie. So what.

50
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,316
WhiIe Ross is on the phone...

51
00:03:35,418 --> 00:03:38,353
...everybody owes me
62 bucks for his birthday.

52
00:03:38,421 --> 00:03:42,448
Is there any chance that
you're rounding up from...

53
00:03:44,227 --> 00:03:47,253
...you know, from Iike 20?

54
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,422
We got the gift,
the concert and the cake.

55
00:03:50,466 --> 00:03:53,264
Do we need a cake?

56
00:03:54,337 --> 00:03:57,272
I know it's a IittIe steep.

57
00:03:59,242 --> 00:04:01,267
But it's Ross.

58
00:04:02,212 --> 00:04:03,201
-It's Ross.
-Right.

59
00:04:03,313 --> 00:04:04,371
-I know.
-AII right.

60
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,416
I'II see you guys Iater.
I gotta go do a thing.

61
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:11,319
Okay, I'II caII you Iater.

62
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:14,390
You're not going through with this,
are you?

63
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:17,421
You know, I think I might just.

64
00:04:19,429 --> 00:04:23,331
So, what are you guys
doing for dinner tonight?

65
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:27,335
WeII, I gotta start
saving up for Ross' birthday.

66
00:04:27,403 --> 00:04:30,395
I guess I'II stay home
and eat dust bunnies.

67
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:33,300
You beIieve how much this costs?

68
00:04:33,343 --> 00:04:36,437
Do you guys ever
get the feeIing that...

69
00:04:37,213 --> 00:04:41,411
...ChandIer and those guys don't get
that we don't make that much money?

70
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:43,242
-Yes.
-ReaIIy?

71
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:46,254
They say,
Iet's go here, Iet's go there.

72
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:49,348
Like we can afford to go
here and there.

73
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:55,261
Yes, and we aIways have to go
somepIace nice, you know? God.

74
00:04:55,365 --> 00:05:00,302
And we can't say anything about it,
because this is a birthday for Ross.

75
00:05:00,403 --> 00:05:02,268
-For Ross.
-For Ross.

76
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:07,301
-Oh, my God!
-Hi.

77
00:05:07,377 --> 00:05:09,277
Okay, I'm at work...

78
00:05:09,379 --> 00:05:13,315
...just an ordinary day,
chop, chop, sauté, sauté.

79
00:05:14,183 --> 00:05:16,413
The manager caIIs me into his office.

80
00:05:17,186 --> 00:05:20,178
They fired the Iunch chef.
Guess who got it?

81
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,282
If it's not you,
this is a horribIe story.

82
00:05:24,394 --> 00:05:26,328
FortunateIy, it is me.

83
00:05:26,396 --> 00:05:29,229
And they made me head of purchasing!

84
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:31,199
That's so cooI!

85
00:05:31,234 --> 00:05:34,294
Anyway, I think we
shouId go out and ceIebrate.

86
00:05:34,404 --> 00:05:37,202
You know, somepIace nice.

87
00:05:42,312 --> 00:05:43,438
SomepIace nice.

88
00:05:44,247 --> 00:05:47,216
How much you think
I can get for my kidney?

89
00:05:53,256 --> 00:05:55,451
-You can't do this.
-Come on.

90
00:05:56,225 --> 00:05:59,319
I can't get a girI Iike her with
conventionaI methods.

91
00:05:59,362 --> 00:06:02,263
It doesn't matter.
She wanted to caII Bob.

92
00:06:02,365 --> 00:06:05,300
Bob couId be
who she was meant to be with.

93
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:08,394
You may be destroying
a chance for happiness.

94
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:11,265
We don't know Bob.

95
00:06:11,374 --> 00:06:15,310
Okay, we know me. We Iike me.
PIease Iet me be happy.

96
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:20,181
Go over there
and teII that woman the truth.

97
00:06:20,316 --> 00:06:22,307
AII right.

98
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:24,379
Go.

99
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:34,387
-Hi.
-Hi.

100
00:06:35,231 --> 00:06:36,391
Listen, I have to....

101
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,327
I have to confess something.

102
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:41,300
Yes?

103
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:46,299
Whoever stood you up is a jerk.

104
00:06:47,243 --> 00:06:49,234
-How did you--?
-I don't know.

105
00:06:50,413 --> 00:06:56,318
I just had this weird sense. But
that's me, I'm weird and sensitive.

106
00:06:58,254 --> 00:06:59,346
Tissue?

107
00:07:00,256 --> 00:07:01,382
Thanks.

108
00:07:02,392 --> 00:07:05,259
No, you keep the pack.

109
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:08,195
I'm aII cried out today.

110
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:26,270
Here is to my sister,
the newIy appointed head Iunch chef.

111
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:28,306
AIso in charge of purchasing.

112
00:07:28,384 --> 00:07:31,319
Head Iunch chef,
in charge of purchasing--

113
00:07:31,421 --> 00:07:35,289
Who has her own IittIe desk
when RoIand's not there.

114
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:39,384
Lunch chef, purchasing, own desk
when RoIand's not there...

115
00:07:39,429 --> 00:07:43,195
-...here's to my--
-Wait! And I got a beeper!

116
00:07:43,232 --> 00:07:45,427
-CooI.
-Let's see.

117
00:07:46,335 --> 00:07:48,326
That's fine, I'II just wait.

118
00:07:48,404 --> 00:07:51,339
Sorry.

119
00:07:51,407 --> 00:07:53,307
Monica!

120
00:07:55,411 --> 00:07:58,437
Are we ready to order?
We haven't even Iooked.

121
00:07:59,215 --> 00:08:00,375
When you do, Iet me know.

122
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,142
I'II be over there
on the edge of my seat.

123
00:08:09,192 --> 00:08:10,352
Look at these prices!

124
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,288
Yeah, these are pretty cha-ching.

125
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:18,163
I know. What are these,
famous chickens?

126
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:21,363
-Sorry I'm Iate. CongratuIations.
-Thanks.

127
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:25,407
I'm not sorry. How incredibIe
was my afternoon with Jade?

128
00:08:26,175 --> 00:08:30,168
Pretty incredibIe, according to
the message on my machine.

129
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:34,306
Why is this woman Ieaving a message
for you on my machine?

130
00:08:34,383 --> 00:08:38,376
I toId her my number was yours.
I couIdn't say it was mine...

131
00:08:39,188 --> 00:08:42,282
...because she thinks
my number is Bob's number.

132
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:46,386
TeII me again.
What do I do when Mr. Roper caIIs?

133
00:08:48,331 --> 00:08:49,320
Do I dare ask?

134
00:08:49,432 --> 00:08:53,232
I'II start with carpaccio,
then the griIIed prawns.

135
00:08:53,336 --> 00:08:55,236
Sounds great, same for me.

136
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:58,398
-And for the gentIeman?
-I'II have the Thai pizza.

137
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:03,372
But if I get it without the nuts
and Ieeks and stuff, is it cheaper?

138
00:09:04,247 --> 00:09:06,374
You'd think, wouIdn't you?

139
00:09:07,183 --> 00:09:12,143
-Miss.
-Okay, I wiII have the side saIad.

140
00:09:12,388 --> 00:09:15,357
And what wouId that
be on the side of?

141
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:20,395
I don't know. Why don't you just put
it right here next to my water.

142
00:09:22,398 --> 00:09:24,366
And for you?

143
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:30,406
I'm gonna have a cup
of the cucumber soup and....

144
00:09:32,275 --> 00:09:34,266
Take care.

145
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:39,371
-I wiII have the Cajun catfish.
-Anything eIse?

146
00:09:40,182 --> 00:09:43,310
Yes, how about a verse of
''KiIIing Me SoftIy''?

147
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,412
You're gonna sneeze
in my fish, aren't you?

148
00:09:52,228 --> 00:09:56,392
Does anybody eIse feeI Iike
they just gave birth to an aIien?

149
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,392
No!

150
00:09:58,434 --> 00:10:02,302
PIus tip, divided by six....

151
00:10:02,338 --> 00:10:06,206
And everyone owes 28 bucks.

152
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:07,435
Everyone?

153
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:10,404
You're right, I'm sorry.

154
00:10:11,213 --> 00:10:12,202
Thank you.

155
00:10:12,248 --> 00:10:16,241
-Monica's night. She shouIdn't pay.
-Thank you.

156
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:20,415
So five of us is $33.50 apiece.

157
00:10:21,223 --> 00:10:23,316
No. No way.
Sorry, not gonna happen.

158
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:26,428
Prom night fIashback.

159
00:10:28,431 --> 00:10:31,229
Sorry, I'm happy you got promoted...

160
00:10:31,334 --> 00:10:37,330
...but coId cucumber mush
for 30-something bucks? No!

161
00:10:37,373 --> 00:10:44,245
RacheI just had that IittIe saIad and
Joey with a teeny pizza! It's just....

162
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,248
Okay, Pheebs.

163
00:10:46,349 --> 00:10:50,342
How about we'II each pay for
what we had? It's no big deaI.

164
00:10:50,453 --> 00:10:52,478
Not for you.

165
00:10:56,258 --> 00:10:58,385
AII right, what's going on?

166
00:10:58,461 --> 00:11:04,297
I don't wanna get into this right now.
It'II make everybody uncomfortabIe.

167
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:06,390
You can teII us.

168
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:09,403
Yeah, heIIo? It's us. We'II be fine.

169
00:11:10,206 --> 00:11:11,298
Yeah.

170
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,337
Okay, we three...

171
00:11:18,447 --> 00:11:25,216
...feeI Iike that sometimes
you guys don't get that....

172
00:11:32,228 --> 00:11:34,458
We don't have
as much money as you.

173
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,426
-Okay.
-I hear you.

174
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,429
We can taIk about that.

175
00:11:44,373 --> 00:11:46,341
WeII, then...

176
00:11:47,376 --> 00:11:49,537
-...Iet's.
-Fine.

177
00:11:50,346 --> 00:11:55,443
I guess I just never think
of money as an issue.

178
00:11:55,551 --> 00:11:58,281
-Because you have it.
-Good point.

179
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:04,225
So how come you guys
haven't taIked about this before?

180
00:12:04,293 --> 00:12:07,387
It's aIways something.
Like Monica's new job...

181
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,423
...or the whoIe Ross' birthday hoopIa.

182
00:12:12,234 --> 00:12:17,501
I don't want my birthday to be
the source of any kind of negative....

183
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,333
There's gonna be a hoopIa?

184
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:27,246
BasicaIIy there's the thing,
and then the stuff after the thing--

185
00:12:27,349 --> 00:12:32,343
If you feeI better, we'II forget
the thing and we'II just do the gift.

186
00:12:32,455 --> 00:12:38,451
-Gift? The thing's not the gift?
-We wouId see Hootie and the BIowfish.

187
00:12:39,261 --> 00:12:40,228
Hootie and the--

188
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:44,231
I can catch them on the radio.

189
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:47,359
No. Now I feeI bad.
You wanna go to the concert.

190
00:12:47,436 --> 00:12:50,234
No, Iook. It's my birthday...

191
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:53,365
...and the important thing
is that we're together.

192
00:12:53,476 --> 00:12:57,435
-AII of us.
-Not at the concert.

193
00:12:58,447 --> 00:13:00,278
-Okay.
-Thank you.

194
00:13:00,382 --> 00:13:02,373
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

195
00:13:08,224 --> 00:13:12,217
So the EboIa virus.
That's gotta suck, huh?

196
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:21,397
Monica, what's in the bag?
I don't know. Let's take a Iook.

197
00:13:21,437 --> 00:13:24,304
It's Iike a skit.

198
00:13:25,307 --> 00:13:31,303
Why, it's dinner for six. Five steaks
and an eggpIant for Phoebe.

199
00:13:32,314 --> 00:13:36,410
We switched meat suppIiers.
They gave me steaks as a thank-you.

200
00:13:36,452 --> 00:13:41,355
But wait, there's more.
ChandIer, what is in that enveIope?

201
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:47,252
By the way, this didn't
seem so dorky out in the haII.

202
00:13:47,329 --> 00:13:51,265
Why, it's six tickets to
Hootie and the BIowfish!

203
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:55,428
The BIowfish!

204
00:13:56,472 --> 00:14:00,374
It's on us. So don't worry.
This is our treat.

205
00:14:01,277 --> 00:14:04,212
So, thank you.

206
00:14:06,282 --> 00:14:08,216
CouId you be Iess enthused?

207
00:14:08,284 --> 00:14:12,414
Look, it's a nice gesture. It is.
But it just feeIs Iike....

208
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:14,381
Like?

209
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,191
-Charity.
-Charity?

210
00:14:17,293 --> 00:14:19,420
We're just trying to do a nice thing.

211
00:14:20,196 --> 00:14:24,292
You have to understand, your
nice thing makes us feeI this big.

212
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,234
ActuaIIy, it makes us feeI that big.

213
00:14:30,306 --> 00:14:33,298
I don't understand.
We can't win.

214
00:14:33,342 --> 00:14:39,406
If you aII feeI this big, maybe that's
not our fauIt, it's just how you feeI.

215
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:44,215
Now you're teIIing us how we feeI.

216
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,311
We shouIdn't taIk about this.

217
00:14:46,355 --> 00:14:51,452
I'm gonna pass on the concert.
Just not in a Hootie pIace right now.

218
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:56,431
-Me neither!
-Me too!

219
00:14:56,532 --> 00:14:59,262
Guys, we bought the tickets.

220
00:14:59,335 --> 00:15:04,170
Then you'II have extra seats
for aII your tiaras and stuff.

221
00:15:04,273 --> 00:15:07,208
Why did you Iook at me
when you said that?

222
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:12,380
So I guess now we can't go.

223
00:15:12,481 --> 00:15:18,181
Do what you want. Do we aIways
have to do everything together?

224
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,211
You know what? You're right.

225
00:15:20,322 --> 00:15:22,290
Fine!

226
00:15:25,294 --> 00:15:27,194
AII right.

227
00:15:27,296 --> 00:15:29,389
We're gonna go.

228
00:15:34,336 --> 00:15:38,397
It's not for another six hours.
We're gonna go then.

229
00:15:45,447 --> 00:15:47,244
-ChandIer.
-Yeah.

230
00:15:47,316 --> 00:15:50,410
-Jesus! Are you ready?
-Yes.

231
00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:54,411
Just Iet me grab my jacket
and teII you I had sex today.

232
00:15:56,325 --> 00:15:58,316
What? You had sex today?

233
00:15:59,228 --> 00:16:02,254
It sounds even cooIer
when somebody eIse says it.

234
00:16:03,265 --> 00:16:07,361
I was awesome. She was biting her Iip
to stop from screaming.

235
00:16:07,469 --> 00:16:08,401
Wow.

236
00:16:09,204 --> 00:16:13,163
I know it's been a whiIe,
but I took that as a good sign.

237
00:16:17,413 --> 00:16:22,180
-StiII doing the screening?
-I had sex today.

238
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:25,287
I never have to
answer that phone again.

239
00:16:25,387 --> 00:16:28,220
<i>After the beep,</i>
<i>you know what to do.</i>

240
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:29,416
<i>Bob, it's Jade.</i>

241
00:16:30,192 --> 00:16:33,491
<i>I wanted to tell you I was hurt</i>
<i>when you didn't show up.</i>

242
00:16:34,229 --> 00:16:38,325
<i>And just so you know,</i>
<i>I ended up meeting a guy.</i>

243
00:16:39,301 --> 00:16:42,293
-Bob here.
-Oh, hi.

244
00:16:42,404 --> 00:16:44,395
So you met someone, huh?

245
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,305
<i>Yes, I did.</i>

246
00:16:46,408 --> 00:16:50,401
<i>In fact, I had sex</i>
<i>with him two hours ago.</i>

247
00:16:52,448 --> 00:16:55,417
So how was he?

248
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:57,314
<i>Eh.</i>

249
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:05,385
Eh?

250
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:09,392
<i>Bob, he was nothing compared to you.</i>

251
00:17:12,301 --> 00:17:15,395
<i>I bit my lip to keep from</i>
<i>screaming your name.</i>

252
00:17:18,207 --> 00:17:21,199
WeII, that makes me feeI so good.

253
00:17:21,377 --> 00:17:25,313
<i>It was just so awkward and bumpy.</i>

254
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:31,175
Maybe he had some kind of new,
cooI styIe you're not famiIiar with.

255
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,380
Maybe get used to it.

256
00:17:33,188 --> 00:17:37,284
<i>There wasn't much time to get</i>
<i>used to it, if you know what I mean.</i>

257
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:50,305
I'm not gonna be abIe to enjoy this.

258
00:17:50,406 --> 00:17:54,342
Yeah, I know. It's my birthday.
We aII shouId be here.

259
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,344
So Iet's go.

260
00:18:02,351 --> 00:18:05,149
Maybe we shouId stay for one song.

261
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,155
It wouId be rude to them
for us to Ieave.

262
00:18:08,223 --> 00:18:11,249
The guys are probabIy
having a great time.

263
00:18:14,363 --> 00:18:18,299
-Come on, you guys. One more time.
-Okay.

264
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:21,359
-One.
-No.

265
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:32,213
-That was amazing!
-ExceIIent!

266
00:18:32,281 --> 00:18:35,478
-I can't beIieve the guys missed it!
-What guys? Yeah.

267
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:40,388
Excuse me.
Aren't you Monica GeIIer?

268
00:18:40,422 --> 00:18:43,186
-Do I know you?
-You babysat me!

269
00:18:44,193 --> 00:18:48,186
Oh, my God! LittIe Stevie Fisher?
How have you been?

270
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,424
Good. I'm a Iawyer now.

271
00:18:50,332 --> 00:18:52,425
You can't be a Iawyer.
You're 8.

272
00:18:53,202 --> 00:18:55,397
Nice to see you.
I gotta run backstage.

273
00:18:55,504 --> 00:18:58,439
-Backstage?
-My firm represents the band.

274
00:18:59,241 --> 00:19:01,232
-Ross.
-ChandIer.

275
00:19:02,377 --> 00:19:05,141
-You wanna meet the group?
-Yeah!

276
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:06,236
Come on.

277
00:19:06,281 --> 00:19:10,183
Are you one of the ones
that fooIed around with my dad?

278
00:19:15,257 --> 00:19:16,246
Hey, you guys!

279
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:20,352
-Happy birthday!
-Thank you.

280
00:19:22,264 --> 00:19:24,255
How was your night Iast night?

281
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:28,166
It pretty much sucked.
How was yours?

282
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:32,366
Ours sucked too. But I ran into
Stevie Fisher. Remember him?

283
00:19:33,175 --> 00:19:37,407
Oh, yeah! I used to babysit him.
How's his dad?

284
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:40,273
Good.

285
00:19:40,382 --> 00:19:43,408
Aside from that,
the evening was a bust.

286
00:19:44,219 --> 00:19:46,380
Yeah, we reaIIy missed you guys.

287
00:19:47,189 --> 00:19:51,182
Yeah, we were just saying,
this whoIe thing is so stupid.

288
00:19:51,226 --> 00:19:56,391
We just have to reaIIy not Iet stuff
Iike this about money, get Iike--

289
00:19:56,431 --> 00:19:59,229
Is that a hickey?

290
00:20:00,202 --> 00:20:01,499
No, I just....

291
00:20:02,237 --> 00:20:04,296
I feII down.

292
00:20:05,507 --> 00:20:08,305
On someone's Iips?

293
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:12,305
-Where'd you get the hickey?
-You know, a party or--

294
00:20:12,347 --> 00:20:16,215
-What party?
-It wasn't a party so much as...

295
00:20:16,318 --> 00:20:19,219
...a gathering of peopIe.

296
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:24,358
With food and music and the band.

297
00:20:24,426 --> 00:20:27,361
You partied with
Hootie and the BIowfish?

298
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:31,365
Yes. ApparentIy,
Stevie and Hootie are Iike this:

299
00:20:31,466 --> 00:20:34,230
Who gave you that hickey?

300
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:37,238
That wouId be the work of a BIowfish.

301
00:20:39,441 --> 00:20:42,433
I can't beIieve it!
I can't beIieve this!

302
00:20:42,544 --> 00:20:48,449
We're just sitting at home,
trying to guess Joey's fingers...

303
00:20:48,483 --> 00:20:52,385
...and you guys are out Iike partying
and having fun and aII:

304
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:55,479
''Hey, BIowfish, suck on my neck!''

305
00:20:58,293 --> 00:21:01,194
Don't bIame us.
You couId've been there.

306
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:05,326
What? As part of your
poor friends outreach program?

307
00:21:06,201 --> 00:21:07,293
Great, it's work.

308
00:21:07,336 --> 00:21:11,238
I don't know what to say.
Sorry we make more than you.

309
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,332
We're not gonna feeI guiIty.
We work hard.

310
00:21:14,443 --> 00:21:16,308
And we don't work hard?

311
00:21:16,411 --> 00:21:18,311
It's Monica. You paged?

312
00:21:18,347 --> 00:21:22,408
It's just that we Iike doing stuff
that costs a IittIe more.

313
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:25,420
-And you feeI Iike we hoId you back.
-Yes!

314
00:21:26,221 --> 00:21:27,313
No!

315
00:21:30,325 --> 00:21:33,317
Leon, wait. Guys!

316
00:21:33,428 --> 00:21:38,229
I don't understand. The steaks were
a gift from the meat vendor.

317
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:41,361
That was not a kickback.
I'II just repIace them...

318
00:21:41,436 --> 00:21:44,337
...and we can forget the whoIe thing.

319
00:21:46,275 --> 00:21:48,368
What corporate poIicy?

320
00:21:49,278 --> 00:21:50,336
No--

321
00:21:53,348 --> 00:21:54,372
Yeah.

322
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,342
Okay.

323
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,415
I just got fired.

324
00:22:09,231 --> 00:22:13,327
-Here's your check. That'II be $4.1 2.
-Let me get that.

325
00:22:16,505 --> 00:22:19,303
You got 5 bucks?

326
00:22:27,516 --> 00:22:31,213
<i>Here comes the beep.</i>
<i>You know what to do.</i>

327
00:22:31,253 --> 00:22:33,414
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

328
00:22:36,325 --> 00:22:39,351
<i>Listen, Bob.</i>
<i>I'm probably way out of line here.</i>

329
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:43,420
<i>It's been three years,</i>
<i>and you're probably seeing someone...</i>

330
00:22:43,532 --> 00:22:47,434
<i>...but if we could have one night,</i>
<i>for old times' sake....</i>

331
00:22:47,469 --> 00:22:52,429
<i>One hot, steamy, wild night....</i>
