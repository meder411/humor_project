1
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:09,538
HoId on a second.

2
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,337
Nice. Nice.

3
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:18,246
-Something for you.
-What's this?

4
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,251
81 2 bucks.

5
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:25,484
Didn't Big Leon teII you? It's a
thousand if you want me for the night.

6
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:29,353
-What is this for?
-WeII, I'm making money now.

7
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:35,392
I'm paying you back for headshots,
eIectric biIIs, pizza-- Love you, man.

8
00:00:35,468 --> 00:00:39,495
WeII, thanks, man.
Now I can get my pony.

9
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:44,470
This is a IittIe extra something
for aIways being there for me.

10
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,573
Wow! I don't know what to say.

11
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:56,478
Wow! I don't know what to say.

12
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,520
-What do you say?
-I don't know.

13
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,353
It's a braceIet.

14
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:05,454
Isn't it? It's engraved too.
Check it out.

15
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:08,232
''To my best bud.''

16
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,330
Thanks, best bud.

17
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:18,343
-Put it on!
-Now?

18
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:23,338
It shouId be saved
for a speciaI occasion.

19
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:26,546
That's the beauty part.
It goes with everything.

20
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,448
You put this on,
you're good to go.

21
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:36,394
I've never been ''good to go,''
so why not try some jeweIry, huh?

22
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:40,491
Oh, man!

23
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:44,302
You are so wearing that braceIet.

24
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,471
I so am.

25
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,367
Any idea what this wiII
do for your sex Iife?

26
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,378
It might sIow down at first...

27
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:55,506
...but once I'm used to the weight,
I'II be back on track.

28
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,474
The One With the Prom Video

29
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:45,387
-This aII Iooks good.
-Great.

30
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,558
If I want to caII for a job reference?

31
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:52,362
That's right there.
The manager, ChandIer Bing.

32
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:53,497
AII right.

33
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:58,266
Let's see if you're as good in person.
Make me a saIad.

34
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,404
A saIad? I couId do
something more compIicated.

35
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:04,416
No, just the saIad wiII be fine.

36
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,309
You got it.

37
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:11,516
Now, I want you to teII me what
you're doing whiIe you're doing it.

38
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:15,523
AII right.
WeII, I'm tearing the Iettuce.

39
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:18,457
-Is it dirty?
-Don't worry, I'II wash it.

40
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,427
Don't. I Iike it dirty.

41
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:25,431
It's your caII.

42
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,463
So, what are you going to do next?

43
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:31,436
I thought I'd cut up the tomatoes.

44
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:34,275
Are they firm?

45
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,338
They're okay.

46
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,351
You sure they're not bad?

47
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,353
You sure they're not very, very bad?

48
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,452
No, they're okay.

49
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,256
You gonna sIice them reaI nice?

50
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:52,297
I was gonna do them juIienne.

51
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:56,359
I'm out of here.

52
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:06,303
HeIIo?

53
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,347
RacheI's not here.
Can I take a message?

54
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,314
How do we speII Casey?

55
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:15,412
Is it Iike ''at the Bat''
or ''and the Sunshine Band''?

56
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,224
Hey, who's this Casey?

57
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,455
A guy she met at a movie.

58
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:24,457
What does he want with her?

59
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,256
ProbabIy ''do a IittIe dance.''

60
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,533
You know, ''make a IittIe Iove.''

61
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,243
WeII, pretty much ''get down tonight.''

62
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,442
I don't know. I don't--

63
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:47,383
I don't get it. Two months ago,
RacheI and I were cIose.

64
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:51,253
Now I take messages from guys
she meets at movies?

65
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:55,350
This Casey shouId be
taking down my messages, you know?

66
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,396
Or RacheI and I shouId be together...

67
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,433
...and we shouId get
a message service.

68
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,293
Hang in there, it'II happen.

69
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,201
How do you know that?

70
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:09,204
Because she's your Iobster.

71
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,437
She's going somewhere.

72
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:19,310
It's a known fact that Iobsters
faII in Iove and mate for Iife.

73
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:23,412
You know what? You can actuaIIy
see oId Iobster coupIes...

74
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:27,420
...waIking around their tank
hoIding cIaws, Iike....

75
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:32,424
You have to picture Iobsters.

76
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,429
You feeIing better?

77
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,270
I think the fifth shower
got the interview off me.

78
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:43,534
Do you have other possibiIities?

79
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,337
There is the possibiIity
that I won't make rent.

80
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:49,438
I can Iend you some money.

81
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:55,346
If I couIdn't pay you back right away,
I'd feeI guiIty and tense around you.

82
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,348
Why not borrow it from Mom and Dad?

83
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,325
You feeI guiIty and tense around them.

84
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:04,227
Might as weII make money off of them.

85
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,398
The man's got a point.

86
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,192
What is that sparkIy thing?

87
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,233
That thing?

88
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,199
Yeah, it's a IittIe fIashy.

89
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:19,243
No, no.

90
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:23,213
No, no. It's not fIashy.
Not for a GoodfeIIa.

91
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:29,416
That is sharp! That must've
cost you a few doubIoons.

92
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:35,320
It's fun. It's Iike knowing
one of the Gabor sisters.

93
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:42,234
-Hi.
-Hi, darIing.

94
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,324
What's this?

95
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,234
Some of your oId stuff.

96
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,364
WeII, sweetie,
we have a surprise for you.

97
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:52,241
We're turning your room into a gym.

98
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:54,537
Wow, that is a surprise!

99
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,374
Just one question.
Why not Ross' room?

100
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,280
We taIked about that...

101
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:04,186
...but he had so many science
trophies, pIaques, merit badges.

102
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,281
We didn't wanna disturb them.

103
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:07,417
God forbid.

104
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,228
What's new? What can you teII us?
How's your job?

105
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:15,233
My job? WeII....

106
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:19,201
Did I mention I stiII
don't have a boyfriend?

107
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,330
Oh weII. I just assumed.

108
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:28,209
-Oh, hi, RacheI!
-Hi.

109
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:31,442
We're sorry to hear
about your parents spIitting up.

110
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:35,449
WeII, they're just separated.
You never know. We'II see.

111
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:38,247
I can't say we were surprised.

112
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:43,352
They've been unhappy
since we've known them.

113
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,330
EspeciaIIy after
the incident in Hawaii.

114
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,259
What? What incident?

115
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:53,429
No, no. I must be
thinking of someone eIse.

116
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,370
Maybe me.

117
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,466
Don't you have foIding to do?

118
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,437
FoId, dear. You foId.

119
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,285
-Want a refiII?
-I'm aII right, thanks.

120
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:12,180
Give me a second.
I want to get this right.

121
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,492
EIeven o'cIock,
totaIIy hot babe checking you out.

122
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:27,202
That was reaIIy good.
I think I'm ready for my penis now.

123
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:38,315
I know what you're thinking.
Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's.

124
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,318
-I'm GaiI.
-ChandIer.

125
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,258
I have to go.
It was nice meeting you.

126
00:08:55,434 --> 00:09:00,201
ExceIIent. He couId have
gotten me a VCR or goIf cIubs.

127
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,366
But he got me the ''woman repeIIer.''

128
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,368
The eyesore from
the Liberace House of Crap.

129
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:09,176
-It's not bad.
-Easy for you to say.

130
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:13,378
You're not sporting a reject
from the Mr. T CoIIection.

131
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,383
''I pity the fooI that puts on
my jeweIry. I do.''

132
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,414
''I pity the fooI that--''
Hi.

133
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,420
Hey, man. We were just
doing some impressions.

134
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:26,323
Do your MarceI Marceau.

135
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,226
That's actuaIIy good.

136
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,439
WouId you Iook at that guy?

137
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:44,307
-How Iong have they been taIking?
-A coupIe minutes.

138
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,214
Try doubIing that.

139
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,413
It's Iike, ''Back off, buddy.
She's a waitress, not a geisha.''

140
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,222
I think she's okay.

141
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:59,230
Look at that. She pushes him away
and he won't budge.

142
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,266
I'm gonna do something.

143
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:07,331
We'II get a condo on the
mountain. Ski in, ski out. Great.

144
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:10,332
Excuse me? Are you RacheI?

145
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:11,538
What?

146
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,343
Ross GeIIer.

147
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:18,478
God, in your ad you said
you were pretty, but wow!

148
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,344
What are you doing?

149
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,356
Oh, my God, is this the wrong day?

150
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:30,260
I don't beIieve it. If it works out,
we'II have something to teII the kids.

151
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,387
You sure wiII.

152
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,397
I've gotta go.

153
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
Take care.

154
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,368
See you Iater.
Nice meeting you.

155
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,497
You're weIcome.

156
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,274
-What?
-I was saving you.

157
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,509
Saving me from a pIeasant
conversation with a man?

158
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:51,374
From where I was--

159
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,282
Ross, Iisten to me.

160
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,514
I am not yours to save.

161
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,481
But you are.

162
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:58,585
What?

163
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,260
You're my Iobster.

164
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,266
Are you being
the bIind-date guy again?

165
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:12,337
No, you're my Iobster.

166
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,229
Lobsters....

167
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,369
In the tank, when they're oId...

168
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:23,439
...they get with the--
They waIk around hoIding the cIaws.

169
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,477
In the tank!

170
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,482
With the hoIding and....

171
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:33,258
Pheebs, wanna heIp
with the Iobster thing?

172
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,260
Do the cIaws again.

173
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,287
Forget the Iobsters, okay?

174
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,356
Let's taIk--
What about us?

175
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,460
Ross, there is no ''us.'' Okay?

176
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,364
-No, but--
-No. Listen to me!

177
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:49,498
I feII for you and get cIobbered.

178
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:53,268
You faII for me
and I again get cIobbered.

179
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:56,509
I'm tired of being cIobbered,
you know?

180
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,477
It's just not worth it.

181
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:02,247
-WeII, but--
-No ''but,'' Ross.

182
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:05,449
We are never gonna happen, okay?
Accept that.

183
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,417
''Except that'' what?

184
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,421
No. No.

185
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:17,427
Accept that.

186
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,236
Oh.

187
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,337
I gotta go.

188
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:42,257
Hey, man. Look, it's my best bud!
How you doing?

189
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,459
You're getting good at that
MarceI Marceau thing.

190
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:52,294
What do you say we pIay some baII?
You and me?

191
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,467
Okay, that's my bad.

192
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,336
If you hated the braceIet,
you shouId have just said so.

193
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:05,406
Doesn't the fact that I wore it say
how much our friendship means to me?

194
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:10,211
But you insuIted the braceIet
and you made fun of me.

195
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:13,257
WeII, that's the part
where I'm a wank.

196
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,326
I hoped we wouIdn't focus on that.

197
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:19,454
Oh, yeah? WeII, focus on this.

198
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:25,269
Hard to argue with that.

199
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,441
Come on! I said I was
sorry a hundred times.

200
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,369
I promise to never take it off my...

201
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:34,334
...wrist.

202
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:40,352
If you want to stay in there
and be mad...

203
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:42,443
...you just stay in there.

204
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:44,381
You know what the--

205
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,348
I am here, on my knees...

206
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,361
...hoIding up these couch cushions...

207
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:54,366
...as a symboI
of my sorrow and regret.

208
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,461
Much Iike they did in bibIicaI times.

209
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:01,205
You may haveth anger now....

210
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:06,310
You're gonna grab yourseIf again,
aren't you?

211
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,509
You know, that Steffi Graf
has quite a tush.

212
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,313
I'm just saying!
Right there.

213
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,419
-Hey, guys.
-Hi, darIing.

214
00:14:22,261 --> 00:14:24,252
You didn't bring my grandson?

215
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:29,427
-He's at CaroI's and Susan's today.
-A woman in my office is a Iesbian.

216
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,428
I'm just saying.

217
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:38,341
Jack, Iook. There's that house
paint commerciaI that cracks you up.

218
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,375
-Where have you been?
-EmotionaI heII.

219
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:49,352
-Did they Iend you the money?
-I haven't asked them yet.

220
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,355
Come on, Monica, do it.

221
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,550
Hey, you guys.

222
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,359
Monica has some news.

223
00:14:56,462 --> 00:15:01,331
Listen, I'm sorry I didn't
teII you this before but...

224
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:05,335
...I'm no Ionger at my job.
I had to Ieave it.

225
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:09,203
-Why?
-Because they made me.

226
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:14,245
You were fired?
What are you gonna do?

227
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:18,409
Judy, reIax. This is our IittIe
''har-Monica'' we're taIking about.

228
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,213
We taught her weII.

229
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:24,346
-10 percent of your paycheck goes...?
-In the bank.

230
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:28,257
So she dips into her savings.
That's why it's there.

231
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:31,421
She's gonna be fine.
Aren't you, sweetie?

232
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,260
In the bank.

233
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:37,359
If you need a IittIe extra,
you know where to find it.

234
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,269
Anything Iarger back there?

235
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,237
I can't beIieve it.

236
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,468
WouId you stop aIready?

237
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,246
Get out of the bitter barn
and pIay in the hay.

238
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:50,474
You're right.
I shouId pIay in the hay.

239
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,346
I just dropped $400 to repIace
a braceIet I hated to begin with.

240
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,287
Bring on the hay.

241
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,251
Hey!

242
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:03,395
I've got something
that'II make you happy.

243
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,397
Guess what Gunther found?

244
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,392
Now you have two!

245
00:16:11,503 --> 00:16:13,232
Oh, you have two.

246
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,434
What am I gonna do?

247
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:19,311
Hey.

248
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,302
Hey.

249
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,314
How come you have two?

250
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,247
This one's for you.

251
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:30,312
Get out!

252
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:32,219
No, I can't.

253
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,263
I know how much this means to you
and it's about more than jeweIry.

254
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,528
It's about you and me
and that we're ''best buds.''

255
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:48,235
Is this friendship?
I think so.

256
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:52,342
Check it out.
We're braceIet buddies!

257
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:54,469
That's what they'II caII us.

258
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:00,218
Here you go.
Pay me back whenever you Iike.

259
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:03,184
You have dinosaur checks?

260
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,382
You get your money
and you Iearn something.

261
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,290
What's wrong with that?

262
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,418
Nothing.

263
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,390
Hey, you're a cheap-osaurus!

264
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:18,233
I'm kidding.
Thank you, I'm very gratefuI.

265
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,237
Hey, Mon, what is this?

266
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:27,211
My bathing suit from high schooI.
I was a IittIe bigger then.

267
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:31,509
That's what they use to cover
Connecticut when it rains.

268
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,318
What's on this videotape?

269
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,320
I don't know. Put it in.

270
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,424
<i>Over here, Jack. Okay.</i>

271
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,230
<i>Rachel's coming up the path.</i>

272
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:55,432
<i>Doesn't she look pretty?</i>
<i>Jack? Can you get this?</i>

273
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:59,340
Oh, my God.

274
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,372
What is with your nose?

275
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:08,185
They had to reduce it
because of my deviated septum.

276
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:12,383
I was wrong. That's what they use
to cover Connecticut.

277
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:16,319
This is us getting ready for prom.

278
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,228
-We don't have to watch.
-Yeah, we do.

279
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,423
-Come on.
-It's fun!

280
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,326
<i>Get a shot of Monica.</i>

281
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:25,495
-<i>Where's Monica?</i>
<i>-Over here, Dad.</i>

282
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,399
<i>Wait. How do you zoom out?</i>

283
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:32,200
<i>There she is.</i>

284
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,439
Some girI ate Monica!

285
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,353
Shut up.
The camera adds ten pounds.

286
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,321
How many cameras are actuaIIy on you?

287
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:50,361
<i>Oh, you look so great!</i>

288
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:53,364
<i>So do you! You look beautiful.</i>

289
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,322
<i>-Oops.</i>
<i>-What?</i>

290
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,334
<i>I got mayonnaise on you.</i>

291
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,269
<i>It's just the shoulder,</i>
<i>not my dress.</i>

292
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:04,267
<i>Everybody, smile.</i>

293
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,368
-<i>Oh, Dad, turn it off!</i>
<i>-It is off.</i>

294
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:11,405
<i>-It is not! What's with the red light?</i>
<i>-It's the off light.</i>

295
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,377
<i>Right, Ross?</i>

296
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,384
Looking good, Mr. Kotter.

297
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,395
<i>-You look pretty tonight.</i>
<i>-Oh, thanks.</i>

298
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:39,241
<i>-What are you doing this summer?</i>
<i>-I'm gonna hang out, work on my music.</i>

299
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:46,316
<i>Is my hook unhooked?</i>
<i>These things keep falling down.</i>

300
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,216
<i>Let me see. I don't know.</i>

301
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,521
<i>What are you gonna do...</i>

302
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,456
<i>The guys are here!</i>

303
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:00,322
<i>...this summer?</i>

304
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:02,366
Work on your music?

305
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,373
Oh, my God, Roy GubIik!

306
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:14,234
You know,
Roy saw <i>Star Wars</i> 31 7 times.

307
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,337
He made the paper.

308
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:20,284
<i>Where's Chip?</i>
<i>Why isn't he here yet?</i>

309
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:23,286
<i>He'll be here, okay?</i>
<i>Take a chill pill.</i>

310
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:25,480
<i>There.</i>

311
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,460
I just toId RacheI
that Roy touched my boob.

312
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:42,269
<i>I can't go to my prom without a date.</i>
<i>I can't. It's too late.</i>

313
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:45,309
<i>If you're not going,</i>
<i>I don't want to go.</i>

314
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,277
<i>Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass!</i>

315
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,506
<i>I have a wonderful idea.</i>

316
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,479
<i>You should take Rachel to the prom.</i>

317
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:56,511
<i>Doubtful.</i>

318
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:00,258
<i>Jack, give me that.</i>
<i>Talk to your son.</i>

319
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,419
<i>All right, go on.</i>
<i>This is heavy.</i>

320
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:07,357
<i>Your mother's right.</i>
<i>Take her. You can wear my tux.</i>

321
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,332
<i>She won't go with me.</i>

322
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:12,337
<i>Of course she would.</i>
<i>You're a college man.</i>

323
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,462
<i>-I don't know.</i>
<i>-Well, come on.</i>

324
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,468
<i>Don't you wanna find out?</i>

325
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:20,438
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>I can't go to the prom.</i>

326
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,344
<i>This is so harsh!</i>

327
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:30,278
<i>-Okay. Hold my board.</i>
<i>-Attaboy. Attaboy.</i>

328
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:33,358
I think we've seen enough.
Let's turn it off.

329
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,359
WeII, I'm not gonna watch.

330
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:39,262
<i>Come on, kid. Let's go.</i>

331
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:44,563
<i>-My! Are you handsome!</i>
<i>-Let's show them.</i>

332
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,498
<i>Just a sec, Dad.</i>

333
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:50,373
<i>Okay, be cool. Just be cool.</i>

334
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,219
<i>Okay, Dad.</i>

335
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:05,246
<i>Rachel, ready or not,</i>
<i>here comes your knight in shining--</i>

336
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,416
<i>Oh, no!</i>

337
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,419
