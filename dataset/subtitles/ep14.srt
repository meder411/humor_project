318
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,327
Ross, she wants you.

319
00:23:44,138 --> 00:23:46,299
We just Iive in the same buiIding.

320
00:23:47,141 --> 00:23:49,234
-Any contact?
-She Ient me an egg.

321
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:53,246
-You're in!
-Right.

322
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:55,307
Hey, Ross.

323
00:24:01,322 --> 00:24:04,223
Come on. Get back in the game.

324
00:24:04,325 --> 00:24:09,228
The RacheI thing isn't happening,
your ex-wife's a Iesbian....

325
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,321
I don't think we need a third.

326
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:15,125
CouId we get an egg,
stiII in the sheII?

327
00:24:15,236 --> 00:24:16,225
An egg?

328
00:24:16,271 --> 00:24:21,231
Go up to her and say,
''I'm returning your egg.''

329
00:24:22,143 --> 00:24:24,236
I think it's winning.

330
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:27,339
-It's insane.
-She'II Iove it.

331
00:24:28,182 --> 00:24:32,175
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Here.

332
00:24:34,155 --> 00:24:37,147
Go with the egg, my friend.

333
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:40,284
Go, go, go!

334
00:24:42,297 --> 00:24:45,323
-Think it'II work?
-No way. It's suicide.

335
00:24:46,301 --> 00:24:48,292
The One With The Candy Hearts

336
00:25:36,184 --> 00:25:38,175
-You can't do this.
-Do what?

337
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:43,189
-Roger wants to take her out.
-No! Remember why you dumped him?

338
00:25:43,324 --> 00:25:46,122
Because he was creepy.

339
00:25:46,227 --> 00:25:48,195
And mean. And frightening.

340
00:25:48,229 --> 00:25:53,098
StiII, it's nice to have
a date on VaIentine's Day!

341
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:56,134
You can go out with a creep any night.

342
00:25:57,105 --> 00:25:58,299
I know I do.

343
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:06,337
-What are you doing tomorrow night?
-That depends on how tonight goes.

344
00:26:07,115 --> 00:26:10,141
-About tonight--
-Don't you baiI on me!

345
00:26:10,218 --> 00:26:14,120
I said I'd bring a friend
for her friend.

346
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:18,216
-But her friend sounds Iike a--
-Pathetic mess. I know, but....

347
00:26:19,127 --> 00:26:21,322
Come on. She's needy, vuInerabIe.

348
00:26:21,362 --> 00:26:24,331
I'm thinking....

349
00:26:28,236 --> 00:26:30,170
Thanks.

350
00:26:30,238 --> 00:26:34,334
You haven't been out with a woman
since Janice. You're doing this.

351
00:26:37,245 --> 00:26:41,272
-She said yes.
-Way to go, man!

352
00:26:42,116 --> 00:26:44,209
StiII got the egg, huh?

353
00:26:57,298 --> 00:26:59,289
How do I Iook?

354
00:27:00,134 --> 00:27:02,295
I don't care.

355
00:27:05,306 --> 00:27:07,297
There's Lorraine.

356
00:27:07,341 --> 00:27:11,141
No trading. You get the pretty one,
I get the mess.

357
00:27:11,312 --> 00:27:13,303
Hi, Joey.

358
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:19,210
WeII, weII!
Look what you brought!

359
00:27:19,353 --> 00:27:22,117
Very nice.

360
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,249
And what did you bring?

361
00:27:25,426 --> 00:27:27,326
She's checking her coat.

362
00:27:28,129 --> 00:27:31,223
I'm gonna wash the cab smeII
off of my hands.

363
00:27:31,265 --> 00:27:35,361
Get me a white zinfandeI,
and a gIass of red for Janice.

364
00:27:40,108 --> 00:27:42,167
Janice?

365
00:27:43,111 --> 00:27:45,170
Janice!?

366
00:27:45,313 --> 00:27:47,076
Oh...

367
00:27:47,115 --> 00:27:48,275
...my...

368
00:27:48,316 --> 00:27:50,216
...God!

369
00:27:54,088 --> 00:27:56,318
Hey, it's Janice!

370
00:28:02,196 --> 00:28:04,323
Okay, I'm making a break for it!

371
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:09,297
I've been waiting for, Iike, forever
to go out with Lorraine.

372
00:28:10,104 --> 00:28:12,129
-Just caIm down.
-CaIm down?

373
00:28:12,206 --> 00:28:16,336
You set me up with a woman I've
dumped twice in the Iast five months!

374
00:28:17,345 --> 00:28:21,406
Can you stop yeIIing?
You're making me nervous and....

375
00:28:24,252 --> 00:28:27,119
I can't go when I'm nervous.

376
00:28:27,221 --> 00:28:29,348
I'm sorry, you're right.

377
00:28:33,227 --> 00:28:36,219
Come on! Do it, do it!

378
00:28:38,232 --> 00:28:42,066
Roger was creepy, but he was nothing
compared to Pete.

379
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,104
-Who?
-Pete the Weeper.

380
00:28:44,205 --> 00:28:48,164
The guy that used to cry
every time we had sex?

381
00:28:48,209 --> 00:28:52,111
''Was it good for you?''

382
00:28:53,114 --> 00:28:57,175
I'd take crying any day
over Howard, the ''I win'' guy!

383
00:28:57,285 --> 00:29:00,277
''I win! I win!''

384
00:29:01,122 --> 00:29:05,081
We went out for two months.
I didn't win once.

385
00:29:05,126 --> 00:29:08,289
How do we end up with these jerks?

386
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:11,298
We're some kind of magnets.

387
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:15,325
I know I am. That's why I can't
wear a digitaI watch.

388
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:21,106
There's more beer, right?

389
00:29:23,244 --> 00:29:26,145
You know my friend who shaves her head?

390
00:29:26,314 --> 00:29:27,303
No.

391
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:31,114
I have this friend
who shaves her head.

392
00:29:31,219 --> 00:29:34,154
She says to break the
bad boyfriend cycIe...

393
00:29:34,222 --> 00:29:37,248
...you can do a cIeansing rituaI.

394
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,256
Pheebs, this woman
is voIuntariIy baId.

395
00:29:44,165 --> 00:29:45,291
Yeah.

396
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:48,294
We can do it tomorrow night.

397
00:29:49,103 --> 00:29:51,162
It's VaIentine's Day.
It's perfect.

398
00:29:51,272 --> 00:29:53,297
Okay, what kind of rituaI?

399
00:29:54,075 --> 00:29:58,205
We can burn the stuff they gave us.

400
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,172
Or...?

401
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:06,277
Or we can chant and dance
around naked with sticks.

402
00:30:08,322 --> 00:30:11,291
Burning's good.

403
00:30:20,201 --> 00:30:21,327
You know...

404
00:30:22,103 --> 00:30:26,233
...I can pick up quarters with my toes.

405
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,242
Yeah?
Good for you.

406
00:30:32,213 --> 00:30:35,239
Quarters or roIIs of quarters?

407
00:30:40,354 --> 00:30:44,290
By the way, I cut you out of
aII of my pictures.

408
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:49,359
So if you want, I have a bag
with just your heads.

409
00:30:50,097 --> 00:30:51,291
That's okay.

410
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:55,363
You couId make IittIe puppets
out of them.

411
00:30:56,103 --> 00:31:00,267
And you couId use them in your
Theater of CrueIty!

412
00:31:02,209 --> 00:31:07,112
-We can't do that!
-What? What can't you do?

413
00:31:10,217 --> 00:31:14,085
Can I taIk to you for a second?
Over there?

414
00:31:20,127 --> 00:31:22,322
We might be Ieaving now.

415
00:31:23,097 --> 00:31:26,089
TeII me it's you and me ''we.''

416
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:30,126
She wants to sIather my body
with stuff and Iick it off.

417
00:31:30,237 --> 00:31:33,229
I'm not even sure what sIathering is!

418
00:31:33,307 --> 00:31:37,141
But I definiteIy want
to be a part of it!

419
00:31:37,311 --> 00:31:41,145
Okay, you cannot do this to me.

420
00:31:41,282 --> 00:31:44,046
You're right. I'm sorry.

421
00:31:44,151 --> 00:31:48,349
Can we have three
chocoIate mousses to go?

422
00:31:49,156 --> 00:31:51,283
I'm out of here.

423
00:31:52,259 --> 00:31:56,093
Here's my credit card.
Dinner's on me.

424
00:31:56,197 --> 00:31:59,098
I hope she throws up on you.

425
00:32:01,068 --> 00:32:03,059
Thanks.

426
00:32:04,205 --> 00:32:07,174
-So....
-Just us.

427
00:32:07,274 --> 00:32:10,072
What a crappy night!

428
00:32:10,177 --> 00:32:12,304
I have enjoyed the fact...

429
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:17,176
...that your shirt's been
sticking out of your zipper.

430
00:32:22,289 --> 00:32:25,122
Excuse me.

431
00:32:27,194 --> 00:32:30,186
How you doing?

432
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:37,235
So do we have the best friends,
or what?

433
00:32:37,304 --> 00:32:41,240
Joey's not a friend.
He's...

434
00:32:42,042 --> 00:32:46,138
...a stupid man who Ieft us
his credit card.

435
00:32:46,247 --> 00:32:50,149
Another drink? Dessert?
A big-screen TV?

436
00:32:50,251 --> 00:32:53,243
-I'II have a drink.
-Got it. Good woman!

437
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:02,354
-A bottIe of overpriced champagne.
-Each.

438
00:33:03,097 --> 00:33:06,362
That's right, each.
And a rob roy.

439
00:33:07,101 --> 00:33:09,069
I've aIways wanted to know.

440
00:33:27,087 --> 00:33:32,218
Happy VaIentine's Day!

441
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:42,292
Oh, I miss you aIready.

442
00:33:42,336 --> 00:33:45,328
-Can you beIieve this happened?
-No, no!

443
00:33:47,308 --> 00:33:49,401
And yet it did.

444
00:33:50,144 --> 00:33:53,136
-Goodbye, Janice.
-IKiss me!

445
00:33:55,149 --> 00:33:57,208
Oh, ChandIer. Sorry.

446
00:33:57,318 --> 00:34:00,412
Oh, ChandIer. Sorry!

447
00:34:02,156 --> 00:34:04,215
-Hey, Janice.
-Hi, Monica.

448
00:34:04,325 --> 00:34:08,318
WeII, this was very speciaI.

449
00:34:08,362 --> 00:34:11,422
Rach, come see who's out here!

450
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:15,135
What's going on? Oh, my God!

451
00:34:15,236 --> 00:34:17,329
Janice! Hi!

452
00:34:17,438 --> 00:34:21,374
Janice is gonna go away now!

453
00:34:22,343 --> 00:34:25,278
I'II be right back.

454
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:28,371
Joey! Look who it is!

455
00:34:32,152 --> 00:34:33,278
Good. Joey's home.

456
00:34:33,354 --> 00:34:36,187
This is so much fun!

457
00:34:36,257 --> 00:34:40,125
This is Iike a reunion in the haII!

458
00:34:41,228 --> 00:34:45,221
Ross, there's someone
I want you to say hi to.

459
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,197
He happened to caII.

460
00:34:48,235 --> 00:34:53,195
Hi, Ross. That's right, it's me!
How did you know?

461
00:35:08,322 --> 00:35:12,224
So, if dogs experience jet Iag...

462
00:35:12,326 --> 00:35:16,353
...because of the seven dog years
to one human year thing...

463
00:35:17,164 --> 00:35:20,224
...when a dog fIies
from New York to Los AngeIes...

464
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:25,328
...he doesn't just Iose three hours,
he Ioses a week and a haIf.

465
00:35:28,175 --> 00:35:31,167
That's funny!

466
00:35:38,285 --> 00:35:41,118
They shouId be cooking the food soon.

467
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:42,381
Oh, good.

468
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,192
Who are they?

469
00:35:54,234 --> 00:36:00,104
The bIond is my ex-wife.
The woman touching her is her...

470
00:36:00,207 --> 00:36:03,233
...cIose, personaI friend.

471
00:36:05,112 --> 00:36:10,106
-They're Iovers?
-If you want to put a IabeI on it.

472
00:36:12,252 --> 00:36:16,154
-Anything eIse I shouId know?
-Nope. That's it.

473
00:36:16,357 --> 00:36:20,316
Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby.

474
00:36:23,163 --> 00:36:27,156
I aIways forget that part.

475
00:36:27,234 --> 00:36:29,361
HeIIo!

476
00:36:35,142 --> 00:36:41,081
Now we need sage branches
and the sacramentaI wine.

477
00:36:42,082 --> 00:36:45,108
AII I had is oregano and a Fresca.

478
00:36:45,185 --> 00:36:47,278
That's okay!

479
00:36:51,225 --> 00:36:56,185
Now we need the semen
of a righteous man.

480
00:37:01,101 --> 00:37:06,232
If we had that, we wouIdn't be doing
the rituaI in the first pIace.

481
00:37:06,306 --> 00:37:11,141
-Can we start throwing things in?
-Yeah, okay!

482
00:37:14,114 --> 00:37:16,309
Okay.
Barry's Ietters.

483
00:37:16,417 --> 00:37:19,250
Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.

484
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:25,121
And I have the receipt
from my dinner with....

485
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:31,229
-A picture of Scotty Jared naked!
-Let me see!

486
00:37:31,331 --> 00:37:35,131
-He's wearing a sweater.
-No.

487
00:37:39,306 --> 00:37:42,275
-Whose MCI card is that?
-Mine. Shoot!

488
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:47,275
Remember this number:
Nine, seven, four....

489
00:37:49,083 --> 00:37:52,314
Okay, and here we have
the Iast of PaoIo's grappa.

490
00:37:53,087 --> 00:37:55,282
Wait, isn't it aImost pure--

491
00:37:59,393 --> 00:38:03,295
How can I dump this woman
on VaIentine's Day?

492
00:38:03,397 --> 00:38:07,231
I don't know.
You dumped her on New Year's.

493
00:38:08,102 --> 00:38:12,198
In my next Iife,
I'm coming back as a toiIet brush.

494
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:17,140
HeIIo, funny vaIentine!

495
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,338
Hi, just Janice.

496
00:38:20,147 --> 00:38:23,116
HeIIo, Joey, our IittIe matchmaker.

497
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:26,244
I couId just kiss you aII over,
and I'm gonna.

498
00:38:31,258 --> 00:38:35,217
If you don't do it, I wiII.

499
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:59,212
-So are you actuaIIy from New York?
-Not originaIIy. I'm from--

500
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:03,312
-You said they'd shoot it without you.
-I thought they couId.

501
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:10,087
The maxi-pads were a piece of cake.
Mini-pads shouId be that much easier.

502
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:14,123
-It's VaIentine's Day.
-I know, but it's my job.

503
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:17,227
I'II try to get back
as soon as I can.

504
00:39:17,337 --> 00:39:20,329
I'm spending most of my time
teaching science...

505
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:25,340
...which is funny because
that wasn't even my major.

506
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:40,059
Now, that is funny!

507
00:39:42,095 --> 00:39:47,192
Do you think it wouId be too weird
if I invited CaroI over to join us?

508
00:39:47,267 --> 00:39:53,172
Because she's aIone now.
And pregnant. And sad.

509
00:39:53,207 --> 00:39:57,166
-I guess.
-Are you sure? CaroI!

510
00:39:57,277 --> 00:40:00,212
-Wanna join us?
-No, I'm fine.

511
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,374
Come on.
These peopIe wiII scooch down.

512
00:40:05,085 --> 00:40:10,216
You guys wiII scooch, won't you?
Let's try scooching! Come on!

513
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:13,316
-Come on.
-Thank you.

514
00:40:15,095 --> 00:40:19,122
IKristen Riggs, this is CaroI WiIIick.
CaroI, IKristen.

515
00:40:19,233 --> 00:40:23,135
-How do you do?
-CaroI teaches sixth grade.

516
00:40:23,303 --> 00:40:26,136
And IKristen....

517
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:32,303
IKristen does something...

518
00:40:33,146 --> 00:40:36,206
...that, funniIy enough...

519
00:40:36,316 --> 00:40:40,082
...wasn't even her major!

520
00:40:42,089 --> 00:40:46,253
-Thanks for coming over.
-Not at aII. It's pretty much our job.

521
00:40:46,293 --> 00:40:49,262
That's why we get the cooI hats.

522
00:40:49,296 --> 00:40:54,131
-What do we got there?
-A piece of siIk boxer shorts.

523
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:56,294
Some greeting cards.

524
00:40:57,271 --> 00:41:00,138
A haIf-charred picture of....

525
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:03,267
That guy's hairier than the chief!

526
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,182
It's a reaIIy funny story
how this happened.

527
00:41:10,284 --> 00:41:16,086
I was taking out the trash,
and Phoebe was burning incense--

528
00:41:16,123 --> 00:41:17,215
It's aII right.

529
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:22,319
This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire
we've seen get out of controI.

530
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,323
-Third one tonight.
-ReaIIy?

531
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:30,126
VaIentine's is our
busiest night of the year.

532
00:41:32,172 --> 00:41:35,300
Next time you're burning
your ex-boyfriend's stuff:

533
00:41:35,342 --> 00:41:38,311
One, do it in a weII-ventiIated area.

534
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:44,044
Two, if you wanna burn his cIothing,
stay away from synthetic fabrics.

535
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:49,283
Three, try to Iet go of the anger,
and Iearn to Iove yourseIf.

536
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:55,290
-I brought you something.
-Is it Ioaded?

537
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:05,162
Oh, IittIe candy hearts.
''Chan and Jan Forever.''

538
00:42:06,073 --> 00:42:08,268
I had them made speciaI.

539
00:42:11,311 --> 00:42:14,280
Okay, Janice.

540
00:42:16,316 --> 00:42:19,217
Hey, Janice.

541
00:42:21,188 --> 00:42:23,281
There's no way to teII you this.

542
00:42:23,323 --> 00:42:26,190
At Ieast, there's no new way.

543
00:42:29,196 --> 00:42:33,223
I just don't think things
are gonna work out.

544
00:42:34,401 --> 00:42:38,235
That's fine.

545
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,268
It is?

546
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:46,342
Because I know that this
isn't the end.

547
00:42:47,247 --> 00:42:50,045
You see, actuaIIy, it is.

548
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:53,052
No, because you won't Iet that happen.

549
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,053
Don't you know it yet?

550
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:59,251
You Iove me, ChandIer Bing!

551
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:04,187
Oh, no, I don't.

552
00:43:04,264 --> 00:43:09,258
Why do we keep ending up together?
New Year's, who invited who?

553
00:43:09,369 --> 00:43:13,305
-VaIentine's, who asked who into bed?
-I did, but--

554
00:43:14,107 --> 00:43:15,267
You seek me out!

555
00:43:15,308 --> 00:43:20,302
Something deep in your souI
caIIs out to me Iike a foghorn!

556
00:43:21,114 --> 00:43:24,311
Janice! Janice!

557
00:43:25,118 --> 00:43:29,111
You push me away,
you puII me back!

558
00:43:29,289 --> 00:43:32,122
You want me. You need me.

559
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:37,186
You can't Iive without me.
And you know it.

560
00:43:37,297 --> 00:43:43,133
You just don't know you know it.

561
00:43:46,139 --> 00:43:48,198
See?

562
00:43:54,114 --> 00:43:56,309
CaII me!

563
00:44:03,423 --> 00:44:07,416
It's not true.
I never caIIed your mother a woIverine.

564
00:44:08,161 --> 00:44:11,255
You did so, I swear to--

565
00:44:14,267 --> 00:44:17,327
How Iong has she been in the bathroom?

566
00:44:17,437 --> 00:44:21,168
She isn't in the bathroom.
Her coat's gone.

567
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:25,143
WeII, maybe it's coId in there.

568
00:44:25,378 --> 00:44:29,144
I screwed up my first date
in nine years.

569
00:44:29,182 --> 00:44:32,379
-That couId be it.
-Oh, God.

570
00:44:33,153 --> 00:44:36,452
You know, this is stiII pretty hot.

571
00:44:40,093 --> 00:44:42,186
Mushroom.

572
00:44:42,295 --> 00:44:44,286
SmiIe.

573
00:44:44,397 --> 00:44:49,198
They won't aII be Iike this.
Some might stay through dinner.

574
00:44:49,302 --> 00:44:52,328
-I'm sorry. That's not funny.
-It's just....

575
00:44:53,106 --> 00:44:56,303
You know the whoIe
''get on with your Iife'' thing?

576
00:44:56,343 --> 00:44:59,141
WeII, do I have to?

577
00:44:59,212 --> 00:45:04,149
I'm sitting here
with this cute woman...

578
00:45:04,217 --> 00:45:07,243
...and she's perfectIy nice, but that...

579
00:45:09,356 --> 00:45:11,347
...that's it.

580
00:45:12,125 --> 00:45:17,119
Then I'm here taIking to you,
and it's easy and it's fun.

581
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:19,323
And I don't have to....

582
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:22,260
-I know.
-You know?

583
00:45:25,372 --> 00:45:28,364
Here's a wacky thought.

584
00:45:29,176 --> 00:45:32,373
Let's say you and I give it
another shot.

585
00:45:33,146 --> 00:45:36,274
I know what you're gonna say.
You're a Iesbian.

586
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:42,185
But what do you say we just
put that aside for now.

587
00:45:42,289 --> 00:45:45,190
Let's just stick a pin in it.

588
00:45:45,225 --> 00:45:51,186
Because we're great together.
You can't deny it.

589
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:55,290
I've got a ring at home
that fits you.

590
00:45:55,402 --> 00:46:00,305
I've got Iots of pictures
with both of us in them.

591
00:46:01,107 --> 00:46:05,134
And best of aII,
you're carrying my baby.

592
00:46:05,212 --> 00:46:08,113
-I mean, how perfect is that?
-Ross--

593
00:46:08,215 --> 00:46:13,346
You keep saying that, but there's
something right here. I Iove you.

594
00:46:20,327 --> 00:46:23,319
I Iove you too.

595
00:46:24,164 --> 00:46:26,257
-But--
-No ''but.''

596
00:46:27,334 --> 00:46:32,328
You know that thing we
put over here with the pin in it?

597
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:38,236
It's time to take the pin out.

598
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:46,314
You'II find someone.
The right woman is waiting for you.

599
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:51,284
It's easy for you to say.
You found one aIready.

600
00:46:52,225 --> 00:46:56,218
AII you need is a woman who Iikes men,
and you'II be set.

601
00:46:59,299 --> 00:47:02,234
Not her.

602
00:47:13,246 --> 00:47:17,239
So, you guys reaIIy sIide down a poIe?

603
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:24,113
-AbsoIuteIy.
-That's so cooI.

604
00:47:24,324 --> 00:47:27,157
How do you get back up?

605
00:47:29,162 --> 00:47:33,360
WeII, we rareIy have to return
from a fire as quickIy.

606
00:47:36,369 --> 00:47:39,167
So, wouId you guys....

607
00:47:39,272 --> 00:47:44,209
WouId you Iike to, sometime, maybe....

608
00:47:44,277 --> 00:47:46,268
Go for a drink sometime?

609
00:47:46,313 --> 00:47:48,110
Sure, sounds good.

610
00:47:48,181 --> 00:47:51,275
We get off at midnight.
We'II pick you up then.

611
00:47:52,085 --> 00:47:53,279
Okay. Great!

612
00:47:54,287 --> 00:47:58,189
So wiII you bring the truck?

613
00:47:59,292 --> 00:48:02,193
I'II even Iet you ring the beII.

614
00:48:02,228 --> 00:48:06,187
-We'II see you Iater.
-Bye! See you Iater!

615
00:48:07,233 --> 00:48:08,291
Oh, my God!

616
00:48:10,103 --> 00:48:12,298
See? There you go.
The cIeansing worked.

617
00:48:12,405 --> 00:48:15,397
You're right. They're nice guys!

618
00:48:16,142 --> 00:48:20,101
They're firemen guys!

619
00:48:20,146 --> 00:48:24,242
-TeII them you're married?
-No. My girIfriend doesn't even know.
