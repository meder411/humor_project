1
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:04,369
This is pretty much
what's happened so far.

2
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:07,438
<i>Ross was in love</i>
<i>with Rachel forever.</i>

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:13,240
<i>When he tried to tell her, things got</i>
<i>in the way. Like cats, Italian guys.</i>

4
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,339
<i>Finally, Chandler said,</i>
<i>''Forget about her. ''</i>

5
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:21,284
<i>When Ross was in China, Chandler</i>
<i>let it slip that Ross loved Rachel.</i>

6
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,288
<i>She said, ''Oh, my God!''</i>

7
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:26,291
<i>So she went to the airport</i>
<i>to meet him.</i>

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:30,261
<i>She didn't know Ross</i>
<i>was with another woman.</i>

9
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,491
That's everything you need to know.

10
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,360
Enough about us.
How've you been?

11
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,460
The One With Ross' New GirIfriend

12
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,342
<i>Flight number 257</i>
<i>from Beijing now arriving.</i>

13
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,447
Oh, my God.

14
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:34,451
Oh, my God.

15
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:35,556
Excuse me.

16
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,457
Move, move, move!
Emergency, pIease!

17
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,357
Excuse me.

18
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:50,467
There you are.

19
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:56,277
So, so....

20
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:59,283
How was China?
You!

21
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,454
It was great. What happened?

22
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:04,416
-You're bIeeding.
-I am?

23
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,425
Oh, Iook at that! Yes, I am.

24
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,326
Enough of me,
Mr. Back-from-the-Orient.

25
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:13,331
Come on, I wanna hear everything!
Everything!

26
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,334
WeII, where do I start?

27
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:20,372
This is JuIie.
JuIie, this is RacheI.

28
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,470
These are....
These are...

29
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,340
...aren't for you.

30
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,343
These are for you.

31
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,386
WeIcome to our country.

32
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:40,483
Thank you. I'm from New York!

33
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:47,262
No probIem. We'II use them
to stop the bIeeding.

34
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,567
-Baggage cIaim?
-Okay.

35
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,344
She went to the airport.
She's going for it with Ross.

36
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:05,316
Oh, my God! This is huge!

37
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,210
This is bigger than huge.
This is....

38
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:11,313
AII right, what's bigger than huge?

39
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:13,357
-This?
-Yes.

40
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:16,421
You got new haircuts.

41
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:19,454
Yes, we did.
Thanks to VidaI Buffay.

42
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:24,431
Because, ''If you don't Iook good,
we don't Iook good.''

43
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,461
I Iove that voice.

44
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:32,240
Here. And the winner is Ava Gardner.

45
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,369
You guys.

46
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:39,274
Airport. Airport. Ross. Not aIone.

47
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,478
JuIie. Arm around her.

48
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,358
Cramp! Cramp! Cramp!

49
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,293
I think she's trying to say something.

50
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,353
Quick, get the verbs.

51
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,459
You! You!

52
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:57,293
You said he Iiked me! You!

53
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,496
You sIowpokes!

54
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,401
That's aII right.
We got the bags.

55
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:06,210
-Hi. HeIIo.
-Hi, honey.

56
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:08,212
This is my sister, Monica.

57
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,315
This is ChandIer. Phoebe, hi.

58
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,317
-Joey, what up?
-HeIIo.

59
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:16,211
Everyone, this is JuIie.

60
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,449
JuIie.

61
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,331
I'm not here.
We haven't met.

62
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:29,367
I make a better impression
without 20 hours of pIane on me.

63
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,233
-And bus.
-Oh, my God!

64
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:34,329
-The screaming guy--
-The spitting.

65
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,237
You gotta hear this.

66
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:38,435
We're on this 200-year-oId bus.

67
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:40,269
At Ieast 200.

68
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,349
And the chicken poops in her Iap.

69
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,357
I'm so sorry.

70
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,382
I just gave away the ending.

71
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,360
I just heard this story in the cab...

72
00:04:56,462 --> 00:05:00,228
...and it is aII I can think about.

73
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,427
This is amazing.

74
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:08,332
-How did this happen?
-We were in grad schooI together.

75
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:11,502
Haven't seen each other since.
I Iand in China.

76
00:05:12,245 --> 00:05:14,213
Guess who's in charge?

77
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,248
JuIie!

78
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,308
Isn't that great?

79
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:23,348
Isn't it just kick-you-in-the-crotch,
spit-on-your-neck fantastic?

80
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,416
It's an expression.

81
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,453
We just wanted to say a quick hi.

82
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,425
-Then we'II see the baby.
-Then get sIeep.

83
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,530
It's 6:00 tomorrow, our time.

84
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:39,363
Don't teII us what wiII happen.
I Iike surprises.

85
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,436
Bye!

86
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,548
-Can I get some coffee?
-Sure.

87
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,290
-You taIk to him yet?
-No.

88
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,418
Then, no.

89
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,400
What happened to you in China?

90
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:21,213
When Iast we Ieft,
you were in Iove with....

91
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,210
I know I was.

92
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,251
But there was this voice
that kept saying...

93
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:31,221
...''It'II never happen. Move on.''
You know whose voice it was?

94
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,348
God?

95
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,224
It was you, paI.

96
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,229
Maybe it was God doing me.

97
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:43,531
Aside from being aImighty,
he's a wiz at doing voices.

98
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:48,239
You were right. She Iooks
at me as a friend. That's aII.

99
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,235
Then I met JuIie, and we're
having a great time.

100
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:57,476
I never wouId've gone for it with her,
if not for you.

101
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,311
WeII, you owe me one, big guy.

102
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,210
Your Iemonade.

103
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,313
Didn't order it.

104
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:09,284
Then go take that back.
They'II charge you.

105
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:12,193
Go, go, go. Come on, come on.

106
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,291
So, what'd you find out?

107
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:18,294
He said....

108
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,235
He said....

109
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:27,302
He said they're having
a great time. I'm sorry.

110
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,214
The siIver Iining,
if you wanna see it...

111
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:34,343
...is that he made this decision
by himseIf...

112
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,412
...without any outside heIp
whatsoever.

113
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,517
How is that a siIver Iining?

114
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,421
You have to reaIIy wanna see it.

115
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:53,270
IronicaIIy, these guys
were picked Iast in gym.

116
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:54,464
Hey, Pheebs.

117
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:58,243
-You know what I'm thinking?
-Oh, okay.

118
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,279
How...

119
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,215
...it's been so Iong
since you've had sex...

120
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,413
...you're wondering
if they've changed it?

121
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,383
Not even cIose.

122
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:17,192
No. AIthough now
that's what I'm thinking.

123
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,296
What were you thinking?

124
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,392
You gave the guys great haircuts.
I thought you couId do mine.

125
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:27,338
Oh. No.

126
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:29,196
Why not?

127
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,208
Because I'm just....

128
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,404
I'm incredibIy anaI,
an unbeIievabIe controI freak.

129
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:38,315
-No, you're not.
-I know I'm not, but you are.

130
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,345
I was trying to spare your feeIings.

131
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,419
HoId on.
Ross, JuIie for you.

132
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:57,334
Excuse me.
Who gave her our phone number?

133
00:08:57,436 --> 00:09:01,270
Okay, weII....
Who had the motive?

134
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,400
Was it the actor?

135
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,372
The chef? The masseuse?

136
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,172
Or was it the guy who's dating her?

137
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,319
Guy who's dating her.

138
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,385
Hey.
Anybody know a good taiIor?

139
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:22,223
Need cIothes aItered?

140
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:26,288
No, I'm Iooking for a man
to draw on me with chaIk.

141
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,425
See Frankie. My famiIy's been
going to him forever.

142
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:34,298
He did my first suit when I was 1 5.
No, wait, 1 6.

143
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:38,241
No, excuse me, 1 5.

144
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,404
AII right, when was 1 990?

145
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,445
Stop the Q-Tip
when there's resistance.

146
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,328
Okay. Okay.
Sweetheart, I'II see you Iater.

147
00:09:58,364 --> 00:09:59,422
Okay, bye.

148
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,327
That is so sweet.

149
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,231
Okay. No, you hang up.

150
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,367
No, you--

151
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,246
One, two, three.

152
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,440
You didn't either.

153
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,480
She didn't hang up.

154
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,384
No, you hang up.

155
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,258
You. You.

156
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:43,264
Sorry, I thought
you were taIking to me.

157
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,466
RacheI.

158
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,313
I'II just caII her back.

159
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,507
I'm sorry. We got disconnected.

160
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,478
No, you hang up.

161
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:56,321
How did this happen to me?

162
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,324
A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine.

163
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:02,223
Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.

164
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,525
Now aII of a sudden, he's Ross...

165
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:10,358
...this reaIIy great guy
that I can't have.

166
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:13,336
Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too.

167
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,236
I know you did.

168
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,467
Hey, you wanna hit ChandIer again?

169
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:22,278
I'm just gonna deaI with it.

170
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,444
I gotta get out of here.

171
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:34,452
I don't care what you say.
Something's bothering her.

172
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:41,493
You know, I think I was 1 6.

173
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:47,472
You know, I think I don't care.

174
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,474
PIease, just a IittIe bit
off the back?

175
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,306
I'm stiII on ''no.''

176
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:55,402
Morning.

177
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,473
CouId you cIose your eyes?

178
00:11:58,584 --> 00:12:02,213
No, no, no.
I'm not faIIing for that again.

179
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:07,419
-What's going on?
-I did a stupid thing Iast night.

180
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,428
What stupid thing?

181
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:21,262
PaoIo, now you've seen everybody
and they've aII seen you.

182
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:25,469
How did this happen?

183
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:28,337
I kind of ran into him Iast night.

184
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,372
-Where?
-His apartment. Is this juice?

185
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:35,549
Whoa, the fact that you dumped him
because he hit on Phoebe?

186
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:39,451
Oh, God, I know.
I'm pathetic, I'm a Ioser.

187
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,453
You're not pathetic.
You're just sad.

188
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:45,293
Upset peopIe do stupid things.

189
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:49,494
If I had a nickeI
for every guy I wish I hadn't--

190
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:56,273
But this is
about your horribIe mistake.

191
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,345
Sorry we're Iate.
We were....

192
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,405
WeII, there was touching.

193
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:12,356
-Hey, Ross.
-Hey, PaoIo.

194
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,351
What, uh...?

195
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,219
What are you doing here?

196
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:20,230
I do RaqueI.

197
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:28,272
So he's back?

198
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:31,241
Yeah, he's back.
Is that a probIem?

199
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:32,435
No, not a probIem.

200
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,236
Good. GIad it's not a probIem.

201
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,449
You're gonna have to not touch my ass.

202
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:46,288
WeII, despite the yummy bageIs
and paIpabIe tension...

203
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,360
...my pants need to be aItered.

204
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:52,353
When you see Frankie,
teII him Joey Tribbiani says heIIo.

205
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,389
He'II know what it means.

206
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:59,368
You sure he'II crack that code?

207
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:04,436
It's funny. The Iast time PaoIo
was here, my hair was so much cuter.

208
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,336
AII right.

209
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,442
You have to promise that you
wiII not be controI-y and bossy...

210
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:14,209
...and aII Monica about it.

211
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:18,323
-I promise.
-AII right, Iet's see.

212
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:22,418
Now, some of you are gonna get cut
and some of you aren't.

213
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:27,355
But I promise
none of you wiII feeI a thing.

214
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:43,345
-That's it. I quit.
-What? I didn't say anything.

215
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:47,250
This isn't the face
of a person who trusts a person.

216
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:50,288
This is the face of a person who...

217
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,381
...doesn't trust a person.

218
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,290
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

219
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:59,296
It's just a IittIe shorter
than what we had discussed.

220
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,425
WouId you reIax?
I know what I am doing.

221
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,397
This is how he wears it.

222
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,239
-How who wears it?
-Demi Moore.

223
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:13,311
Demi Moore is not a ''he.''

224
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:16,246
WeII, he was a ''he''
in <i>Arthur</i> and in <i>10.</i>

225
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:19,443
That's DudIey Moore.

226
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:22,447
I said I wanted it Iike Demi Moore.

227
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,412
Oh, my God.

228
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,414
Oh, God.

229
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,321
Oh, my God! I'm sorry!

230
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,228
Which is Demi Moore?

231
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:38,235
She's the actress that was in
<i>Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost.</i>

232
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:39,463
She's got gorgeous hair.

233
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,228
I know.

234
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:44,275
I wanted to Iook Iike her.

235
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:50,474
-You know, my mom's dead.
-Oh, my God.

236
00:15:57,489 --> 00:16:01,482
WeII, this is what my butt
must Iook Iike to a fIy.

237
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:08,289
-How Iong do you want the cuffs?
-At Ieast as Iong as I have the pants.

238
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,203
I just got that.

239
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:20,207
Now we'II do your inseam.

240
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:37,225
-How is she?
-It's too soon to teII.

241
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,458
She's resting, which is a good sign.

242
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:43,223
How's the hair?

243
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:46,429
I'm not gonna Iie to you.
It doesn't Iook good.

244
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:56,246
-There's nothing you can do?
-At this point, it's a waiting game.

245
00:16:56,382 --> 00:17:00,375
I put a cIip on one side,
which seems to stop the curIing.

246
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,378
Can we see her?

247
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:06,289
Your hair Iooks too good.
It wouId upset her.

248
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:09,259
Ross, why don't you come on in?

249
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:18,267
-WeII, how you doing?
-I'm okay.

250
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:20,498
-That bad, huh?
-What?

251
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,437
I can sense when women
are depressed and vuInerabIe.

252
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,405
It's one of my gifts.

253
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:35,319
Joey, when I saw him
get off that pIane with her...

254
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:38,356
...I reaIIy thought
I hit rock bottom.

255
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,318
But today, it's Iike
there's rock bottom...

256
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,419
...50 feet of crap...

257
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,260
...then me.

258
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,264
TeII Ross how you feeI.

259
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,360
How can I just teII him?
What about JuIie?

260
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,430
What about her?
It's onIy been two weeks.

261
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,233
Ross has been in Iove
with you for 10 years.

262
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,275
I don't know. I don't know.

263
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,179
I've been with my share of women.

264
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,378
I've been with a Iot
of peopIe's share of women.

265
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,219
But the point is...

266
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:16,386
...I've never feIt about anyone
the way Ross feIt about you.

267
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,193
ReaIIy?

268
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,304
Yo, <i>paesan.</i>

269
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:32,210
Can I taIk to you for a sec?

270
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,245
Your taiIor...

271
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:39,409
...is a very bad man.

272
00:18:41,353 --> 00:18:43,321
What are you taIking about?

273
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,356
Hey, what's going on?

274
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,421
Joey's taiIor...

275
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,527
...took advantage of me.

276
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,268
-What?
-No way.

277
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:05,207
-I've been going to him for years.
-He said he was doing my inseam.

278
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:09,179
Then he ran his hand up my Ieg
and there was definite--

279
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,270
What?

280
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,376
Cupping.

281
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,287
That's how they do pants.

282
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:22,316
First, they go up one side,
they move it over.

283
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:27,421
Then, up the other side,
move it back. Then they do the rear.

284
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,395
Isn't that how a taiIor
measures pants?

285
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:36,231
Yes, yes, it is.
In prison.

286
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,215
What's the matter with you?

287
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:45,305
What?

288
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:50,444
That's not?

289
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:57,353
Oh, my God.

290
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,428
I'II put on a pot of coffee.

291
00:20:10,342 --> 00:20:13,277
Even Mary TyIer Moore
wouId've been better.

292
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,372
Come on. It's not that bad.
You never know.

293
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,350
BeII-bottoms came back.

294
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,479
I Iike it.

295
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:25,448
I do. I think it's a 10.

296
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,350
Thank you.

297
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,293
My hair is amused.

298
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:34,457
Come on, things couId be worse.

299
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:38,458
You couId ''get caught between
the moon and New York City.''

300
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:43,407
''It's crazy, but it's true.''

301
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,503
Thank you.

302
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,372
WeII, I gotta go. Bye.

303
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,383
-Bye, Rach.
-Wait, are you Ieaving?

304
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,317
That's what I meant by ''bye.''

305
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:59,323
-Can I taIk to you for a sec?
-Okay.

306
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:04,318
When the doctor does
that hernia test....

307
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,424
That's okay.

308
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:13,333
If your mechanic does it....

309
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,273
What's going on?

310
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:23,439
WeII, okay, first of aII...

311
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,478
...PaoIo and I are not back together.

312
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,243
That was a stupid thing I did.

313
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,346
If I couId go back in time
and do it again...

314
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,448
...weII, I wouIdn't.

315
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,259
Second of aII....

316
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:40,487
What?

317
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:47,461
Is this one of those things
where you break up with a guy...

318
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:52,305
...I teII you what I think,
you get back together with him...

319
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:55,312
-...and I Iook Iike a compIete idiot?
-No.

320
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:59,507
WeII, then, I think the guy's scum.

321
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,413
I hate him. I actuaIIy--
I physicaIIy hate him.

322
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:06,315
I aIways have.

323
00:22:06,358 --> 00:22:10,317
And you are way too good
to be with a guy Iike that.

324
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,321
ReaIIy?

325
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,461
You deserve someone
who appreciates you...

326
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:20,432
...and who gets how funny
and sweet and amazing...

327
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:24,231
...and adorabIe and sexy you are.

328
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,471
You know? Someone who wakes up
every morning thinking...

329
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,475
...''Oh, my God. I'm with RacheI.''

330
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,451
You know?
Someone who makes you feeI good.

331
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,278
Like the way I do with JuIie.

332
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,359
Was there a ''second of aII''?

333
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:54,370
No, I think that was the whoIe ''aII.''

334
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,469
I gotta go. Okay. Okay.

335
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:02,506
-Okay.
-Okay.

336
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,314
No, I swear to God, Dad.
That's not how they measure pants.

337
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:23,265
I was thinking shorter,
Iike Andie MacDoweII's haircut.

338
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:25,462
-Yeah, I couId do that.
-ReaIIy?

339
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:27,533
-You wanna do it now?
-Great!

340
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:31,434
See you.

341
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:35,378
I just wanna make
reaIIy sure this time.

342
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:40,350
Andie MacDoweII is the girI from
