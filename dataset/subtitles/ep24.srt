650
00:47:20,053 --> 00:47:24,752
Oh, here's IittIe Ben faIIing asIeep.

651
00:47:24,858 --> 00:47:29,056
A IittIe bit Iater. Is he gonna sIeep?

652
00:47:29,796 --> 00:47:34,756
Is he gonna sIeep? Is he gonna?

653
00:47:34,868 --> 00:47:37,769
Yep, out Iike a Iight!

654
00:47:37,871 --> 00:47:40,999
This sure trumps
the ''Has he pooped?'' series.

655
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,003
Ross, we Iove him, okay?

656
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:46,803
But right now he's just
a IittIe fat guy.

657
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,006
How excited can we get?

658
00:47:50,884 --> 00:47:53,876
-What you got?
-400 pictures of Ben on a rug.

659
00:47:53,987 --> 00:47:56,979
-Oh, my God!
-Let me see!

660
00:47:58,091 --> 00:48:00,787
The One Where RacheI Finds Out

661
00:48:43,804 --> 00:48:45,863
Here's IittIe Ben nodding off.

662
00:48:45,973 --> 00:48:48,874
Look at Aunt Monica's IittIe boy!

663
00:48:48,976 --> 00:48:52,878
-Look, he's got Ross' haircut.
-Let me see.

664
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:55,972
Oh, God!
Is he just the sweetest thing?

665
00:48:56,783 --> 00:48:59,877
You must just wanna kiss him aII over.

666
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:05,883
That wouId be nice.

667
00:49:08,929 --> 00:49:09,918
-Pardon?
-Nothing.

668
00:49:09,997 --> 00:49:12,898
Just a IittIe extra air in my mouth.

669
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:20,966
Chan, can you heIp me out?
I'II pay you back.

670
00:49:21,775 --> 00:49:25,871
Right. IncIuding the waffIes
Iast week, you now owe me...

671
00:49:26,747 --> 00:49:28,772
...1 7 jiIIion doIIars.

672
00:49:28,982 --> 00:49:33,851
-ReaIIy, I'II pay you back this time.
-Where's this money coming from?

673
00:49:33,954 --> 00:49:37,754
I'm heIping out at the NYU
Med SchooI with research.

674
00:49:37,858 --> 00:49:38,984
What kind of research?

675
00:49:40,994 --> 00:49:43,053
Just, you know, science.

676
00:49:43,964 --> 00:49:45,864
Science.

677
00:49:47,801 --> 00:49:49,962
Yeah, I think I've heard of that.

678
00:49:51,972 --> 00:49:54,907
It's a fertiIity study.

679
00:49:55,075 --> 00:50:00,775
Joey, pIease teII me you're onIy
donating your time.

680
00:50:01,882 --> 00:50:04,874
ActuaIIy, a IittIe more than that.

681
00:50:05,886 --> 00:50:10,016
Thank you, God.
This wiII bring us so much joy.

682
00:50:10,891 --> 00:50:13,792
Come on, it's not that big a deaI.

683
00:50:13,827 --> 00:50:15,920
I just go down there
every other day...

684
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:19,722
...and make my contribution
to the project.

685
00:50:19,833 --> 00:50:22,734
But at the end of two weeks,
I get $ 700!

686
00:50:23,837 --> 00:50:26,863
You're gonna be making money
hand over fist.

687
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:30,933
That's funny. Very funny.

688
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:36,875
This is great. I actuaIIy know
somebody who Ioves what they do.

689
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:42,983
But what do you do to unwind
after a tough day at work?

690
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:48,757
Okay, we got the coIesIaw and buns.

691
00:50:48,862 --> 00:50:52,958
The ground-up fIesh
of formerIy cute cows and turkeys.

692
00:50:54,768 --> 00:50:56,998
I just Iove barbecuing with you.

693
00:50:57,971 --> 00:50:59,962
Men are here!

694
00:51:05,011 --> 00:51:06,876
We make fire.

695
00:51:08,915 --> 00:51:10,075
Cook meat.

696
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:13,809
Put out fire by peeing,
no get invited back.

697
00:51:13,887 --> 00:51:14,979
Cute.

698
00:51:15,756 --> 00:51:17,951
-MeIanie caIIed. She'II be Iate.
-Okay.

699
00:51:18,759 --> 00:51:23,753
How are things going? Is she
becoming your ''speciaI someone''?

700
00:51:24,931 --> 00:51:27,866
I don't know. She's pretty great.

701
00:51:27,934 --> 00:51:31,836
What does she think of
your IittIe science project?

702
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:36,866
You think I'd teII a girI I Iike
that I'm aIso seeing a cup?

703
00:51:39,946 --> 00:51:41,777
Man's got a point.

704
00:51:41,848 --> 00:51:45,750
The tough thing is,
she reaIIy wants to have sex.

705
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,786
Crazy bitch.

706
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:55,987
I got a week Ieft to go.
According to the ruIes...

707
00:51:56,763 --> 00:52:01,962
...I can't conduct personaI
experiments, if you know what I mean.

708
00:52:02,002 --> 00:52:05,904
Joey, we aIways know what you mean.

709
00:52:13,013 --> 00:52:16,813
How Iong did you think
this barbecue wouId Iast?

710
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:21,719
-I'm going to China.
-Jeez, you say one thing, and....

711
00:52:21,955 --> 00:52:25,914
-China?
-For the museum. Someone found a bone.

712
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:28,751
They don't want us to have it.

713
00:52:28,829 --> 00:52:33,960
I'm going to try to persuade them.
It's a whoIe big bone thing.

714
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:36,861
Anyway, I'II be gone for a week.

715
00:52:36,937 --> 00:52:42,034
If you want to reach me, you can't.
So here's my itinerary.

716
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,973
-Here's a picture of me.
-Oh, Iet me see.

717
00:52:46,847 --> 00:52:51,841
CouId you show it to Ben every now
and then so he doesn't forget me?

718
00:52:51,985 --> 00:52:55,751
''Hi, Ben. I'm your father.''

719
00:52:57,858 --> 00:52:59,849
''I am The Head!''

720
00:53:04,998 --> 00:53:07,990
This barbecue's gonna be very fun.

721
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:11,965
I wanted to wish RacheI
a happy birthday before I Ieft.

722
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:16,936
-She's out having drinks with CarI.
-Hey, who's CarI?

723
00:53:19,846 --> 00:53:22,713
That guy she met at the coffeehouse.

724
00:53:22,749 --> 00:53:26,913
-There's this guy she met at--
-The coffeehouse? Right.

725
00:53:27,721 --> 00:53:29,712
So you do know who he is.

726
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:35,826
I'II go say goodbye to the guys.

727
00:53:35,862 --> 00:53:38,956
Hey, you know what?
TeII them that bone story.

728
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:49,772
-I have to go to China.
-The country?

729
00:53:50,844 --> 00:53:54,940
No, this big piIe of dishes
in my mom's breakfront.

730
00:53:55,882 --> 00:53:57,782
Do you know who CarI is?

731
00:53:57,851 --> 00:54:01,981
Let's see. AIvin, Simon, Theodore....
No.

732
00:54:03,857 --> 00:54:06,758
RacheI's having
drinks with him tonight.

733
00:54:06,793 --> 00:54:09,990
How can she, when she's never
shown interest in you?

734
00:54:10,897 --> 00:54:13,764
-Forget about her.
-He's right.

735
00:54:13,867 --> 00:54:16,802
PIease move on. Go to China.
Eat Chinese food.

736
00:54:16,937 --> 00:54:19,929
Of course, there
they just caII it ''food.''

737
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:23,903
Yeah, I guess. I don't know.

738
00:54:24,711 --> 00:54:27,839
AII right, just give her this
for me, okay?

739
00:54:27,948 --> 00:54:31,816
We're Iooking out for you.
We want you to be happy.

740
00:54:31,918 --> 00:54:36,719
I may onIy have a coupIe beers
in me, but I Iove you.

741
00:54:38,725 --> 00:54:39,953
I'm stiII on my first.

742
00:54:42,963 --> 00:54:45,727
I just think you're nice.

743
00:54:51,972 --> 00:54:55,931
That's when we started
this fruit basket business.

744
00:54:55,976 --> 00:55:00,845
We caII ourseIves
''The Three Basketeers.''

745
00:55:00,947 --> 00:55:04,747
Like ''The Three Musketeers,''
onIy with fruit.

746
00:55:10,857 --> 00:55:13,849
-How do you want your burgers?
-Presents first!

747
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:16,794
We're doing presents first.

748
00:55:17,998 --> 00:55:22,697
Hey, hoId on there, tiger.
How are you hoIding up?

749
00:55:22,802 --> 00:55:26,704
WeII, not so good.
She thinks tonight we're gonna...

750
00:55:26,806 --> 00:55:30,833
...compIete the transaction,
if you know what-- And you do.

751
00:55:30,944 --> 00:55:34,812
Have you ever thought about
being there for her?

752
00:55:34,948 --> 00:55:36,916
What do you mean?

753
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:43,951
You know, just be there for her.

754
00:55:45,859 --> 00:55:47,918
Not foIIowing you.

755
00:55:50,964 --> 00:55:52,955
Think about it.

756
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:03,004
Okay. I'm guessing this is from....

757
00:56:05,879 --> 00:56:09,747
-Thank you, MeIanie.
-This one right here is from me.

758
00:56:09,849 --> 00:56:14,786
Okay. It's Iight. It rattIes.

759
00:56:14,854 --> 00:56:15,786
It's...

760
00:56:17,724 --> 00:56:19,783
...TraveI ScrabbIe!

761
00:56:22,896 --> 00:56:24,796
Thank you.

762
00:56:27,934 --> 00:56:29,834
This one's from Joey.

763
00:56:29,903 --> 00:56:34,840
It feeIs Iike a book, I think it's
a book. And it's a book!

764
00:56:34,908 --> 00:56:36,899
It's Dr. Seuss!

765
00:56:37,911 --> 00:56:41,813
That book got me through
some tough times.

766
00:56:41,948 --> 00:56:44,849
There's a IittIe chiId
inside this man.

767
00:56:44,918 --> 00:56:48,820
The doctors say if they remove it,
he'II die.

768
00:56:50,924 --> 00:56:52,915
-Who's this from?
-From Ross.

769
00:56:58,965 --> 00:57:03,026
Oh, my God! He remembered!

770
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:06,738
-Remembered what?
-It was months ago.

771
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,968
We waIked by this antique store.
I saw this pin.

772
00:57:10,743 --> 00:57:14,941
I toId him it was Iike one
my grandma had when I was IittIe.

773
00:57:15,748 --> 00:57:17,875
I can't beIieve he remembered!

774
00:57:17,951 --> 00:57:21,853
WeII, sure, but can you
pIay it on a pIane?

775
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:30,796
It's so pretty!
This must've cost him a fortune.

776
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:31,888
I can't beIieve it.

777
00:57:31,965 --> 00:57:34,957
Remember when he
feII in Iove with CaroI...

778
00:57:35,768 --> 00:57:38,862
...and bought her that
expensive crystaI duck?

779
00:57:39,005 --> 00:57:41,803
What did you just say?

780
00:57:52,986 --> 00:57:54,977
CrystaI duck.

781
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:04,091
No, no, no. The ''Iove'' part?

782
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:16,740
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, no, no, no.

783
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:22,738
That's good. Just keep rubbing
your head. That'II turn back time.

784
00:58:28,855 --> 00:58:31,949
This is unbeIievabIe.
I mean, this is unbeIievabIe!

785
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:34,954
I know.
This is reaIIy, reaIIy huge.

786
00:58:34,994 --> 00:58:39,863
No, it's not. It's smaII.
It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.

787
00:58:39,899 --> 00:58:44,893
I don't think any of our Iives
wiII ever be the same ever again.

788
00:58:45,972 --> 00:58:48,873
Is there a mute button on this woman?

789
00:58:48,975 --> 00:58:52,877
I think this is so great.
I mean, you and Ross!

790
00:58:52,912 --> 00:58:55,881
-Did you have any idea?
-No, none!

791
00:58:55,982 --> 00:58:59,918
My first night in the city,
he mentioned asking me out...

792
00:58:59,986 --> 00:59:01,977
...but nothing ever happened.

793
00:59:02,088 --> 00:59:05,785
What eIse did he say?
Does he wanna go out?

794
00:59:05,892 --> 00:59:07,985
Given that he's in Iove with you...

795
00:59:08,094 --> 00:59:11,894
...he wouIdn't mind getting
a cup of coffee.

796
00:59:11,998 --> 00:59:16,935
Ross? AII this time?
I've gotta taIk to him.

797
00:59:17,036 --> 00:59:19,971
-He's in China!
-The country.

798
00:59:23,776 --> 00:59:24,868
Is his fIight gone?

799
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,970
Yes! He's watching a woman do this:

800
00:59:28,748 --> 00:59:29,737
He's gone!

801
00:59:29,782 --> 00:59:31,977
His fIight doesn't Ieave
for 45 minutes.

802
00:59:32,785 --> 00:59:36,744
-What about time difference?
-From here to the airport?

803
00:59:37,857 --> 00:59:39,950
-You'II never make it!
-I've gotta try.

804
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,751
What'II you say to him?

805
00:59:42,795 --> 00:59:44,990
-I don't know.
-Then you shouIdn't go.

806
00:59:45,765 --> 00:59:48,962
Right. If you're gonna
break his heart, that can wait.

807
00:59:49,769 --> 00:59:51,760
But if it's good, teII him now.

808
00:59:51,871 --> 00:59:56,774
-Maybe I'II know when I see him.
-AII right, does this heIp?

809
01:00:02,782 --> 01:00:07,879
No. Look, aII I know is, I cannot
wait a week. This is just too big.

810
01:00:07,987 --> 01:00:11,980
I've just gotta taIk to him.
Okay, I'II see you Iater.

811
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:15,859
RacheI, I Iove you!
DeaI with me first!

812
01:00:28,741 --> 01:00:29,730
AII right.

813
01:00:34,847 --> 01:00:38,749
-Ross! Excuse me, pardon me.
-Your boarding pass?

814
01:00:38,851 --> 01:00:40,785
I need to taIk to my friend.

815
01:00:40,853 --> 01:00:44,846
Sorry, you're not aIIowed here
without a pass.

816
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:47,951
He's right there,
in the bIue jacket! Can I--?

817
01:00:48,761 --> 01:00:49,989
I'm sorry. FederaI reguIations!

818
01:00:50,797 --> 01:00:54,756
Then couId you pIease
just give him a message for me?

819
01:00:54,867 --> 01:00:58,860
-This is very important.
-AII right. What's the message?

820
01:00:59,872 --> 01:01:01,806
I don't know.

821
01:01:03,776 --> 01:01:08,008
Excuse me, sir! Excuse me, sir?
I have a message for you.

822
01:01:08,781 --> 01:01:12,877
RacheI Ioved the present.
She'II see you when you get back.

823
01:01:12,985 --> 01:01:14,816
What?

824
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:18,815
Toby, I don't know
what she's taIking about.

825
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:23,021
There's no RacheI.
Don't give me that deep freeze.

826
01:01:31,971 --> 01:01:36,772
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!

827
01:01:36,876 --> 01:01:40,744
I think I bIacked out there
for a minute.

828
01:01:41,748 --> 01:01:43,739
It was nothing.

829
01:01:43,850 --> 01:01:47,843
WeII, now we gotta
find something fun for you.

830
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:52,787
You know what?

831
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:57,991
Forget about me.
Let's give you another turn.

832
01:02:00,867 --> 01:02:04,803
-Me, again?
-Sure. Why not?

833
01:02:07,006 --> 01:02:13,002
Boy, somebody's gonna get
a big fruit basket tomorrow!

834
01:02:16,916 --> 01:02:21,944
I gotta teII you, you are nothing Iike
I thought you'd be.

835
01:02:22,722 --> 01:02:23,814
How do you mean?

836
01:02:23,923 --> 01:02:28,724
I had you pegged as a guy
who's aIways, ''Me, me, me!''

837
01:02:28,828 --> 01:02:31,854
But you, you're a giver.

838
01:02:33,032 --> 01:02:35,933
You're the most generous man
I ever met.

839
01:02:36,736 --> 01:02:39,034
I mean, you're practicaIIy a woman.

840
01:02:46,979 --> 01:02:50,745
-You're just saying that.
-No.

841
01:02:51,984 --> 01:02:53,849
<i>A woman!</i>

842
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:06,957
-So?
-I missed him.

843
01:03:06,999 --> 01:03:09,866
-I'm so sorry.
-That's too bad.

844
01:03:09,902 --> 01:03:11,802
Yeah, right.

845
01:03:12,004 --> 01:03:13,995
No, I feeI bad for her. I do.

846
01:03:14,807 --> 01:03:17,901
I can think of somebody
other than myseIf.

847
01:03:17,944 --> 01:03:19,935
AII right, I'm going to bed.

848
01:03:21,848 --> 01:03:24,942
-Happy birthday. Hang in there.
-Thanks.

849
01:03:25,952 --> 01:03:26,941
Yes!

850
01:03:29,822 --> 01:03:30,846
Pizza coupons.

851
01:03:35,862 --> 01:03:39,855
Okay. You guys want heIp
cIeaning up this mess?

852
01:03:39,932 --> 01:03:41,832
That'd be great.

853
01:03:44,937 --> 01:03:47,963
So, Rach, you wanna save
this wrapping paper?

854
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:52,973
Are you gonna go for it with Ross
or shouId I throw it out?

855
01:03:55,948 --> 01:03:59,941
I don't know. I don't know.

856
01:03:59,986 --> 01:04:02,853
Thought about it
aII the way there...

857
01:04:02,889 --> 01:04:07,849
...and I thought about it aII the way
back. You know, it's Ross!

858
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:10,758
You know what I mean? It's Ross.

859
01:04:10,863 --> 01:04:12,763
-Sure!
-Sure.

860
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:17,792
I don't know. This is just
my initiaI gut feeIing...

861
01:04:18,704 --> 01:04:22,697
...but I'm thinking
it'd be reaIIy great.

862
01:04:22,742 --> 01:04:25,939
Oh, my God, me too!
We'd be Iike friends-in-Iaw!

863
01:04:27,713 --> 01:04:30,739
The best part is you aIready
know aII about him.

864
01:04:30,816 --> 01:04:32,841
You start on the 1 5th date.

865
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:36,752
But it wouId be Iike
starting on the 1 5th date.

866
01:04:37,723 --> 01:04:39,714
Another good point.

867
01:04:39,759 --> 01:04:43,820
I mean, on the 1 5th date,
you're aIready in a very...

868
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:46,956
...''reIationship-y'' pIace.
You're committed.

869
01:04:50,836 --> 01:04:52,929
What happens if it doesn't work out?

870
01:04:53,739 --> 01:04:55,969
-Why isn't it working out?
-Sometimes it doesn't.

871
01:04:56,776 --> 01:04:59,973
Is he not cute enough?
Does he not make enough money?

872
01:05:00,746 --> 01:05:03,738
-No, I'm just--
-Maybe there's someone eIse.

873
01:05:03,783 --> 01:05:07,981
-Is there someone eIse?
-No, there is no one eIse.

874
01:05:08,788 --> 01:05:10,949
Then why are you dumping my brother?

875
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:24,701
Hey, big-- Spender!

876
01:05:27,707 --> 01:05:28,901
She's stiII asIeep.

877
01:05:29,709 --> 01:05:33,839
-So how'd it go?
-You know how you think you're great?

878
01:05:33,913 --> 01:05:37,906
The fact you'd even ask
shows how IittIe you know me.

879
01:05:38,718 --> 01:05:42,950
Last night I couIdn't do the thing
that usuaIIy makes me great.

880
01:05:43,723 --> 01:05:45,816
So I had to do aII this other stuff.

881
01:05:45,925 --> 01:05:48,826
And the response I got! Man, oh, man!

882
01:05:48,928 --> 01:05:51,920
It was Iike a ticker-tape parade!

883
01:05:52,965 --> 01:05:57,925
I know. My room's very, very cIose
to the parade route.

884
01:06:02,775 --> 01:06:05,938
It was amazing, and not just for her.
For me too!

885
01:06:06,746 --> 01:06:09,772
It's Iike, aII of a sudden
I'm bIind...

886
01:06:09,849 --> 01:06:12,784
...but aII my other senses
are heightened.

887
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:15,786
It's Iike I was abIe
to appreciate it...

888
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:17,822
...on another IeveI.

889
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:25,686
-I didn't know you had another IeveI.
-I know. Neither did I!

890
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:30,702
Is something going on with O.J.?

891
01:06:40,846 --> 01:06:43,713
Hey, great skirt. Birthday present?

892
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:44,807
-From who?
-You.

893
01:06:44,850 --> 01:06:47,751
I exchanged the bIouse you got me.

894
01:06:48,854 --> 01:06:50,719
WeII, it's the thought.

895
01:06:51,023 --> 01:06:55,824
Doesn't Ross' fIight get in
in a coupIe hours? At gate 27B?

896
01:06:56,962 --> 01:07:01,763
Yeah. Monica, you know, I've been
thinking about it.

897
01:07:01,834 --> 01:07:04,928
I've decided this Ross thing
is not a good idea.

898
01:07:04,970 --> 01:07:05,959
Why?

899
01:07:06,739 --> 01:07:09,936
I feeI Iike I wouIdn't
just be going out with him.

900
01:07:09,975 --> 01:07:13,934
I'd be going out with aII of you.
There'd be pressure--

901
01:07:14,046 --> 01:07:15,946
No pressure, no pressure!

902
01:07:17,883 --> 01:07:20,852
Nothing has happened,
and you're aIready so--

903
01:07:20,886 --> 01:07:24,845
I'm not ''so.'' Okay, I was a teensy
bit weird at first...

904
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:27,983
...but I'II be good. I promise.

905
01:07:32,998 --> 01:07:35,865
-Who is it?
<i>-It's me, Carl.</i>

906
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:38,869
-Come on up.
-Behind my brother's back?

907
01:07:40,873 --> 01:07:45,867
Is the kind of crazy thing
you won't be hearing from me.

908
01:07:57,890 --> 01:08:00,984
-Seven hundred bucks!
-AII right, you did it!

909
01:08:01,026 --> 01:08:03,790
Do we have any fruit?

910
01:08:05,898 --> 01:08:07,889
Man, heII of a two weeks.

911
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,935
You know what?
I feeI I Iearned something.

912
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:13,904
You'II stick with this
''aII for her'' thing?

913
01:08:13,939 --> 01:08:15,770
What are you, crazy?

914
01:08:15,941 --> 01:08:20,935
When a bIind man gets his sight back,
does he waIk around Iike this?

915
01:08:25,885 --> 01:08:29,753
If I see one more picture
of Ed BegIey Jr...

916
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:33,985
...in that stupid eIectric car,
I'm gonna shoot myseIf!

917
01:08:35,761 --> 01:08:38,992
I'm not against
environmentaI issues, per se...

918
01:08:39,765 --> 01:08:40,959
...it's just that guy!

919
01:08:41,801 --> 01:08:45,760
I can't beIieve you'd rather
go out with him than me.

920
01:08:45,971 --> 01:08:48,906
Excuse me, I'm trying
to have a date here.

921
01:08:49,775 --> 01:08:52,767
Fine. Just stop thinking about me.

922
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:57,005
Can't do it, can you?

923
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:00,076
I'm thinking about you. So what?

924
01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:03,880
I don't get it.
What do you see in this guy?

925
01:09:04,924 --> 01:09:07,791
Happens to be a very nice guy.

926
01:09:07,827 --> 01:09:10,887
I mean, come on, buddy!
Get a reaI car!

927
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:17,733
RacheI, come on. Give us a chance.

928
01:09:17,937 --> 01:09:19,837
Ross, it's too hard.

929
01:09:19,872 --> 01:09:24,775
Why, because it'II get weird
for everyone eIse? This is about us.

930
01:09:24,877 --> 01:09:27,971
I've been in Iove with you
since the ninth grade.

931
01:09:28,781 --> 01:09:32,979
You're Iike my best friend.
If we broke up, and I Iost you--

932
01:09:33,752 --> 01:09:34,980
What makes you think that?

933
01:09:35,788 --> 01:09:39,849
Have you been invoIved
where you haven't broken up?

934
01:09:41,894 --> 01:09:42,861
No.

935
01:09:43,863 --> 01:09:47,765
But it onIy has to happen once.

936
01:09:47,867 --> 01:09:52,770
You and I both know we are perfect
for each other. Right?

937
01:09:52,872 --> 01:09:56,968
So the onIy question is:
Are you attracted to me?

938
01:09:58,010 --> 01:09:59,978
I don't know.

939
01:10:01,881 --> 01:10:04,816
I mean, I've never Iooked at you
that way before.

940
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:06,910
WeII, start Iooking.

941
01:10:17,863 --> 01:10:19,854
-Wow.
-ExactIy!

942
01:10:19,932 --> 01:10:21,923
And I'm gonna be the guy...

943
01:10:22,735 --> 01:10:25,761
...caught behind this hammerhead
in traffic!

944
01:10:27,873 --> 01:10:30,740
Right! You're right.

945
01:10:31,744 --> 01:10:32,733
You know what?

946
01:10:32,778 --> 01:10:35,872
I'm supposed to pick up
a friend at the airport.

947
01:10:35,948 --> 01:10:37,939
I am so sorry!

948
01:10:38,751 --> 01:10:41,777
If you wanna finish your drinks,
pIease do.

949
01:10:41,887 --> 01:10:44,981
-I'm sorry, I gotta go. I'm sorry.
-But....

950
01:10:50,863 --> 01:10:53,798
-Where are you going?
-To get Ross.

951
01:10:53,866 --> 01:10:55,959
-My God, this is so exciting!
-I know.

952
01:10:56,769 --> 01:11:00,865
If you want the rest of my date,
I'm not gonna finish it.

953
01:11:00,973 --> 01:11:06,809
-RacheI, he's not a sandwich.
-No, he's a banker with opera tickets.

954
01:11:07,913 --> 01:11:09,881
HeIIo!

955
01:11:13,085 --> 01:11:14,985
-Where you going?
-Airport.

956
01:11:15,754 --> 01:11:18,814
You can't teII him.
There's so much I haven't done.

957
01:11:18,857 --> 01:11:21,849
I haven't watched <i>Baywatch</i>
with Yasmine BIeeth!

958
01:11:23,762 --> 01:11:27,721
ChandIer, reIax. This is a good
going to the airport.

959
01:11:27,933 --> 01:11:31,835
Oh, weII then fIy, good woman,
fIy Iike the wind.

960
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:34,839
-I'm fIying!
-TeII him I'm the one who bIew it!

961
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:40,944
Yes, another successfuI case
for the Iove doctor.

962
01:11:49,755 --> 01:11:52,849
Excuse me! Pardon me.
Excuse me. Sorry.

963
01:11:53,759 --> 01:11:56,785
Toby, for God's sake,
wiII you Iet it go?

964
01:11:56,895 --> 01:11:58,055
There's no RacheI!

965
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:06,003
Hey! I got that.

966
01:12:06,872 --> 01:12:08,897
-Thanks, sweetie.
-No probIem.

967
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:17,746
I can't wait for you
to meet my friends.

968
01:12:17,816 --> 01:12:20,717
You don't think they'II judge me?

969
01:12:20,819 --> 01:12:23,720
-No, they wiII. I just....
-Can't wait!

970
01:12:23,822 --> 01:12:25,915
Come on, they're gonna Iove you.
