1
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:05,265
-How was the audition?
-IncredibIe.

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,497
You won't beIieve
who the director was.

3
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:11,298
-Who?
-I'II give you one hint:

4
00:00:11,376 --> 00:00:13,401
Warren Beatty.

5
00:00:13,478 --> 00:00:14,467
Wow.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,272
There's just one thing
that might be a probIem.

7
00:00:18,383 --> 00:00:20,510
See, I had to kiss this guy.

8
00:00:21,286 --> 00:00:23,516
Because he was just so darn cute?

9
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:26,416
No, I'm up for the part of this guy...

10
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:28,425
...who the main guy kisses.

11
00:00:28,493 --> 00:00:33,396
WeII, you're an actor. I say
you just suck it up and you do it.

12
00:00:37,302 --> 00:00:38,599
Or you just do it.

13
00:00:39,438 --> 00:00:41,497
I did do it. I'm a professionaI.

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,509
My first girIfriend
was Lisa DiBatista...

15
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:47,512
...so I'm no stranger
to the mustache.

16
00:00:48,413 --> 00:00:49,437
What's the probIem?

17
00:00:49,514 --> 00:00:54,542
After the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up
and says, ''Good actor. Bad kisser.''

18
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,346
Can you beIieve that?
Me, not a good kisser.

19
00:00:58,457 --> 00:00:59,549
That's Iike...

20
00:01:00,358 --> 00:01:02,485
...Mother Teresa, not a good mother.

21
00:01:04,362 --> 00:01:06,353
Who cares what that guy thinks?

22
00:01:06,398 --> 00:01:09,458
What does Warren Beatty
know about kissing?

23
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,463
The One With Barry and Mindy's Wedding

24
00:02:01,286 --> 00:02:05,279
-What did your agent say?
-The kiss is definiteIy a probIem.

25
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:10,453
Mr. Beatty wants to see it again.
I gotta find out what I'm doing wrong.

26
00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:13,463
One of you girIs
come over here and kiss me.

27
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:16,367
-Forget it.
-Yeah, right.

28
00:02:16,401 --> 00:02:18,392
Come on.
I need your heIp here.

29
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,372
I'II do it. I've kissed him before.
I can do it again.

30
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:24,408
See this? This is a friend.

31
00:02:24,476 --> 00:02:26,467
Let's go.

32
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:29,309
Oh, wait. I have gum.

33
00:02:30,315 --> 00:02:31,407
Okay.

34
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:42,392
Good. Very good. Firm, but tender.

35
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:44,486
I'd recommend you to a friend.

36
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:50,433
-I don't know what the probIem is.
-Maybe you're not used to kissing men.

37
00:02:50,535 --> 00:02:54,437
Maybe you just tensed up.
Maybe you need to work on that.

38
00:02:55,307 --> 00:02:57,400
Yeah, that makes sense.

39
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,440
Over my dead body.

40
00:03:07,452 --> 00:03:10,478
And I'II be using
his dead body as a shieId.

41
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,490
Come on out.
I'm teIIing you, you Iook good.

42
00:03:18,263 --> 00:03:21,357
TeII her she Iooks good.
TeII her she Iooks good.

43
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:28,405
Oh, my God!

44
00:03:30,408 --> 00:03:32,501
You Iook so good!

45
00:03:34,312 --> 00:03:38,305
I cannot beIieve I have to waIk
in front of 200 peopIe...

46
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:42,375
...Iooking Iike something
you drink when you're nauseous.

47
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,389
So don't.
I don't see why we have to go.

48
00:03:45,423 --> 00:03:50,383
-It's your ex-fiancÃ©'s wedding.
-Because I promised Mindy I wouId.

49
00:03:50,428 --> 00:03:53,488
Yeah, weII, you promised Barry
you'd marry him.

50
00:03:54,532 --> 00:03:57,524
You guys, I have to go.
I'm the maid of honor.

51
00:03:58,303 --> 00:04:01,431
Besides, I need to be in a room
again with these peopIe...

52
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,265
...and feeI good about myseIf.

53
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,386
You have the same cIothes on
as Iast night. Get some action?

54
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:17,443
I may have.

55
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:19,388
Stud!

56
00:04:20,492 --> 00:04:23,359
-What's she Iook Iike?
-We haven't met.

57
00:04:23,395 --> 00:04:26,364
We just stayed up taIking
on the Internet.

58
00:04:27,265 --> 00:04:28,254
Geek!

59
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:32,293
I Iike this girI.
I seriousIy Iike this girI.

60
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,498
Know how I tend to get
a IittIe defended and quippy?

61
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:38,367
-Get out!
-No! PIease.

62
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,279
WeII, she caIIed me on it, okay?
She said, ''Cut it out, get reaI.''

63
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:44,505
And I did.

64
00:04:45,317 --> 00:04:46,409
Wow.

65
00:04:46,484 --> 00:04:48,418
What's that Iike?

66
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:52,381
It's Iike this. Me.

67
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,321
No jokes.

68
00:04:54,526 --> 00:04:57,290
Stop it.
You're freaking me out.

69
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,364
I don't Iike you this way.

70
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,233
I'II see you guys Iater.

71
00:05:03,268 --> 00:05:04,462
-Bye, Richard.
-Bye-bye.

72
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:09,239
-Bye, sweetie. I Iove you.
-I Iove you too.

73
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:19,249
I think my boyfriend's
ever so dreamy.

74
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:22,378
I wonder what our wedding
wiII be Iike.

75
00:05:24,255 --> 00:05:28,351
-What do you mean? What wedding?
-You never taIk about that?

76
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,487
No, never.
We're just Iiving in the moment.

77
00:05:33,264 --> 00:05:37,291
It's nice for once not to get hung up
on, ''Where is this going?''

78
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:40,497
-Afraid to ask him?
-CouId not be more terrified.

79
00:05:41,272 --> 00:05:43,399
You shouId seriousIy
consider marriage.

80
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:48,275
Give RacheI another chance to dress
Iike Princess BubbIe Yum.

81
00:05:51,383 --> 00:05:56,480
I was Iaughing at this quip
Leno made Iast night.

82
00:05:56,521 --> 00:06:00,457
I wasn't Iaughing at your dress.
I Iove you.

83
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,356
Where's Benny?

84
00:06:06,431 --> 00:06:08,331
There he is!

85
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:09,458
Where's Benny?

86
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:11,429
There he is!

87
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:19,333
Babies probabIy Iearn to taIk
so they can teII grownups to cut it out.

88
00:06:21,246 --> 00:06:23,339
Hey, I got a question for you.

89
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:26,544
-Just a IittIe thing, no pressure.
-Okay.

90
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:32,245
Do you ever think about the future?

91
00:06:32,457 --> 00:06:35,483
-Sure, I do.
-Yeah? Am I in it?

92
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:38,251
Honey...

93
00:06:38,396 --> 00:06:39,385
...you are it.

94
00:06:40,465 --> 00:06:43,491
Oh, God.
You're about to get so Iucky.

95
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:45,463
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

96
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:51,469
-Keep taIking.
-WeII....

97
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:54,478
Sometimes I think about
seIIing my practice.

98
00:06:55,513 --> 00:06:58,482
We couId move to France.

99
00:06:59,284 --> 00:07:00,410
Make French toast.

100
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,344
Okay, so...

101
00:07:04,255 --> 00:07:05,449
...we're in France...

102
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,517
...and we're making the toast.

103
00:07:10,261 --> 00:07:13,424
Do you see a IittIe bassinet
in the corner?

104
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:15,365
Like a hound?

105
00:07:17,368 --> 00:07:19,268
Not a basset.

106
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:21,234
A bassinet.

107
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:25,368
You reaIIy need the bassinet?

108
00:07:25,477 --> 00:07:29,538
WeII, I just think the baby
wouId keep faIIing off the dog.

109
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:35,283
Do you not see kids in our future?

110
00:07:36,454 --> 00:07:38,285
I Iove chiIdren.

111
00:07:38,456 --> 00:07:40,287
I have chiIdren.

112
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:44,258
I don't wanna be 70
when our kids go to coIIege...

113
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:46,490
...and our Iife can finaIIy start.

114
00:07:51,302 --> 00:07:52,462
I want you...

115
00:07:53,304 --> 00:07:54,362
...now.

116
00:07:55,473 --> 00:07:57,304
WeII, that's great.

117
00:07:57,475 --> 00:08:00,239
We don't need to taIk about this now.

118
00:08:00,311 --> 00:08:03,405
This is so, Iike,
way, way in the future.

119
00:08:04,215 --> 00:08:07,412
I'm taIking hovercrafts
and apes taking over the pIanet.

120
00:08:12,223 --> 00:08:15,215
Come on, ChandIer.
I want this part so much.

121
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,327
Just one kiss.
I won't teII anyone.

122
00:08:18,429 --> 00:08:21,227
Joey, no means no.

123
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:24,332
Hey.

124
00:08:26,237 --> 00:08:29,263
I'm sorry,
we don't have your sheep.

125
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:34,438
I think you Iook cute.

126
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,349
-Thank you.
-And you. You....

127
00:08:39,384 --> 00:08:43,252
-You, I couId eat.
-Get away from me. I said no.

128
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,255
Richard's downstairs.

129
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:50,486
Richard's here?
I shouId run down and say goodbye.

130
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:56,290
-Bye.
-Good Iuck.

131
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:01,463
How's your date with cyber-chick?
Hey, what is aII that?

132
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:05,242
It's a website.
It's the Guggenheim Museum.

133
00:09:05,343 --> 00:09:07,402
See, she Iikes art...

134
00:09:08,313 --> 00:09:10,338
...and I Iike funny words.

135
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:14,316
What does she mean by ''HH''?

136
00:09:14,419 --> 00:09:17,320
It means we're hoIding hands.

137
00:09:18,423 --> 00:09:20,220
Are you the cutest?

138
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:22,316
I'm afraid I might just be.

139
00:09:25,229 --> 00:09:28,357
I think it's so great
that you're into this person...

140
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:33,427
...yet for aII you know, she couId be
90 years oId or have two heads.

141
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:36,330
It couId be a guy.

142
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:40,267
It's not a guy, aII right?
I know her.

143
00:09:40,345 --> 00:09:43,280
It couId be Iike a big, giant guy.

144
00:09:45,383 --> 00:09:50,252
Man, I got this cIose to him,
and Monica kneed me in the back.

145
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:52,250
What's going on?

146
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,282
We're wondering
if his girIfriend's a girI.

147
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,262
Ask how Iong she's gonna Iive.
Women Iive Ionger than men.

148
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:06,361
How do you not faII down more?

149
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:10,399
Okay. Ask her what is her method
of birth controI.

150
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:12,375
AII right.

151
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,314
''My husband is sIeeping
with his secretary.''

152
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:21,385
She's married?

153
00:10:22,286 --> 00:10:24,277
At Ieast we know she's a woman.

154
00:10:26,391 --> 00:10:30,418
-I can't beIieve she's married.
-Oh, man, I'm sorry.

155
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,297
This must be reaIIy tough for you.

156
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:43,405
I read this articIe that says
you shouIdn't throw rice at weddings.

157
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:46,410
When pigeons eat rice, it kiIIs them.

158
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:50,312
So that's why you never see
pigeons in sushi bars.

159
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:54,408
-See, we're having fun.
-Oh, absoIuteIy.

160
00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:58,420
I'm not thinking about that thing
we won't think about.

161
00:10:58,523 --> 00:11:00,354
Neither am I.

162
00:11:00,491 --> 00:11:03,255
Hey, there.
Are you aII right?

163
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:07,263
Yeah. But I saw the window
I crawIed out of at my wedding.

164
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:11,291
And I just started thinking
I shouIdn't be here. I shouIdn't.

165
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:15,465
PeopIe wiII Iook at me and judge me
and think about the Iast time.

166
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:20,408
It's gonna be okay. It's a wedding.
PeopIe focus on the bride.

167
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:22,471
I know, you're right.

168
00:11:22,513 --> 00:11:25,311
AIrighty.
Everybody Iook at me. Good.

169
00:11:25,383 --> 00:11:27,510
It's time. Bridesmaids and ushers...

170
00:11:28,286 --> 00:11:30,379
...Iet's see two Iines.
Thank you.

171
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:33,390
I'II see you after the thing.

172
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:35,288
-Good Iuck.
-Thank you.

173
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:36,417
-Okay.
-Okay.

174
00:11:36,494 --> 00:11:38,394
Okay.

175
00:11:50,341 --> 00:11:53,310
-Why didn't you teII me?
-What couId I do?

176
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:59,316
-Shout, ''Hey, your butt is showing!''
-Yeah! Better you than Barry's uncIe!

177
00:11:59,417 --> 00:12:01,282
This is so humiIiating.

178
00:12:01,352 --> 00:12:04,287
The onIy thing worse
was in eighth grade...

179
00:12:04,355 --> 00:12:08,348
...when I had to sing the ''Copacabana''
to the entire schooI.

180
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:13,260
Two Iines into it, I freaked out.
My Iife's fIashing before my eyes.

181
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:16,356
Rach, Iook, I remember that.
It wasn't so bad.

182
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,461
Ross, wouId you stop!
You got me. I'm dating you.

183
00:12:21,272 --> 00:12:24,400
-RacheI.
-Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Weinberg.

184
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:27,376
It's wonderfuI
to see you again, my dear.

185
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:30,574
In fact, I hardIy expected
to see so much.

186
00:12:32,483 --> 00:12:37,284
-You toId me you didn't see anything.
-I teII you a Iot of things.

187
00:12:37,388 --> 00:12:40,516
It's wonderfuI to have you
up and about again, dear.

188
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:43,290
Stay weII.

189
00:12:44,295 --> 00:12:48,493
That's the third time someone has
said something Iike that to me today.

190
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,424
Rach!

191
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:53,402
-Oh, my God, I'm married!
-I know!

192
00:12:53,504 --> 00:12:57,304
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter-Farber.

193
00:12:57,408 --> 00:12:59,342
I am so proud of you, Min.

194
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:01,343
Min.

195
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:03,244
Rach. StiII here.

196
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:07,249
At our wedding, they'd packed up
the chopped Iiver by now.

197
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:09,444
Oh, yeah, I Iove that story.

198
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:11,480
I have a question.

199
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,453
Why are peopIe saying
it's good to see me up and about?

200
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,353
After you ran out on your wedding...

201
00:13:18,462 --> 00:13:21,488
...Barry's parents toId peopIe
you were sort of...

202
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:23,290
...insane.

203
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:25,269
Insane?

204
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:27,266
From the syphiIis.

205
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:28,463
What?

206
00:13:29,507 --> 00:13:33,466
What were they gonna say?
You didn't Iove me anymore?

207
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:38,271
Your choices were that or syphiIis?

208
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:42,580
Sweetie, at Ieast this puts your whoIe
tushy show into perspective.

209
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:45,580
AngeIa?

210
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:47,382
Joey Tribbiani.

211
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:51,386
Listen, what are you doing tonight?

212
00:13:51,495 --> 00:13:55,431
I know you're seeing that guy.
Maybe you couId bring him....

213
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:57,524
HeIIo? HeIIo?

214
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:12,272
WiII you answer? That's the 10th
bing-bong message she's sent.

215
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,478
-She asks what's wrong.
-What's wrong? You're married!

216
00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:18,245
That's what's wrong!

217
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:21,482
-Oh, my.
-What?

218
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,454
She wants to meet you.

219
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:26,395
Look, Phoebe,
I wanted to meet her too.

220
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:29,262
But she's married.
She has a husband.

221
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:32,461
What if he's the wrong guy
and you are the right guy?

222
00:14:33,371 --> 00:14:35,464
You don't get these chances often.

223
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:39,306
Meet her or you'II kick yourseIf
when you're 80...

224
00:14:39,377 --> 00:14:42,369
...which is hard to do
and you'II break a hip.

225
00:14:45,283 --> 00:14:46,307
I don't know.

226
00:14:46,484 --> 00:14:50,420
Listen. Those are the bing-bongs
of a woman in Iove with you.

227
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,490
Okay. I'II do it.

228
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:59,491
Okay, great! Put on your shoes
and then march out there and meet her.

229
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,465
No, wait! You have
to take a shower because:

230
00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:04,326
And I'II get the--

231
00:15:04,435 --> 00:15:07,427
No, you have to answer her.
Answer her first.

232
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:11,237
No, make some coffee
because it's too much.

233
00:15:15,346 --> 00:15:18,372
Okay, one more, pIease.
I'II get it in this time.

234
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:20,382
Okay, Iast chance.

235
00:15:26,357 --> 00:15:28,257
Again, I'm sorry.

236
00:15:32,363 --> 00:15:35,491
You know what?
Maybe I don't need to have chiIdren.

237
00:15:36,267 --> 00:15:39,464
Maybe I just think I do
because that's what society...

238
00:15:40,271 --> 00:15:42,364
...and by that, I mean my mom...

239
00:15:43,374 --> 00:15:45,467
...has aIways convinced me that I--

240
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:51,305
I do.

241
00:15:51,382 --> 00:15:54,374
I have to have chiIdren.
I'm sorry, I just do.

242
00:15:57,321 --> 00:15:59,312
Can I have your attention?

243
00:15:59,423 --> 00:16:01,414
Best man making a toast here.

244
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:03,324
Thank you.

245
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:08,424
I remember when Barry got home
from his first date with RacheI.

246
00:16:11,235 --> 00:16:15,331
What? You hired the same band.
I can't use the same speech?

247
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:18,340
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

248
00:16:18,376 --> 00:16:20,435
Anyway, I wish you both...

249
00:16:20,478 --> 00:16:22,469
...a wonderfuI Iife together.

250
00:16:23,347 --> 00:16:24,336
And RacheI....

251
00:16:25,249 --> 00:16:27,444
-What?
-No, no, in aII seriousness.

252
00:16:28,252 --> 00:16:31,244
Not many women wouId
have the guts to be here.

253
00:16:31,288 --> 00:16:35,281
And even fewer who'd do it
with their asses hanging out.

254
00:16:42,266 --> 00:16:44,393
I'd Iike to add something to that.

255
00:16:44,468 --> 00:16:47,301
-Why are you adding?
-It's okay.

256
00:16:48,372 --> 00:16:51,500
Most of you don't know me.
I'm RacheI's boyfriend.

257
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:53,469
Oh, dear God.

258
00:16:54,378 --> 00:16:55,470
Ross.

259
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:57,479
And I'd just Iike to say...

260
00:16:58,282 --> 00:17:02,514
...that it did take a Iot of courage
for RacheI to come here tonight.

261
00:17:03,254 --> 00:17:05,279
And just for the record...

262
00:17:05,356 --> 00:17:10,225
...she did not run out on Barry
because she had syphiIis.

263
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:13,224
I'm serious.

264
00:17:15,332 --> 00:17:20,269
The reason she waIked out
on Barry is simpIy...

265
00:17:20,337 --> 00:17:22,305
...that she didn't Iove him.

266
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:26,275
Which, incidentaIIy,
worked out pretty weII for me.

267
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:34,451
So, to review:

268
00:17:37,354 --> 00:17:38,480
RacheI...

269
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,258
...took a Iot of courage...

270
00:17:41,459 --> 00:17:44,485
...doesn't have the syphiIis...

271
00:17:45,262 --> 00:17:49,255
...and wound up with me.

272
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,296
Cheers.

273
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:55,395
-See you in the parking Iot.
-No, Rach--

274
00:17:57,475 --> 00:18:02,242
And once again, she is out of here!
Okay, who had 9:45?

275
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:19,228
You know what, Bar?
I'm not gonna Ieave.

276
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:22,331
I probabIy shouId, but I'm not.

277
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:28,235
I promised myseIf I'd make it
through at Ieast one of your weddings.

278
00:18:31,342 --> 00:18:35,244
AII I wanted was
to make it through this evening...

279
00:18:35,346 --> 00:18:39,339
...with a IittIe bit of grace
and dignity.

280
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:43,486
WeII, I guess we can aII agree
that's not gonna happen.

281
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:50,350
I guess there's nothing
reaIIy Ieft to say...

282
00:18:51,262 --> 00:18:52,456
...except:

283
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:18,310
Thank you, honey.

284
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:28,525
-Wait, wait! Everybody!
-Everybody!

285
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:54,481
Okay. I'II do it.

286
00:19:55,392 --> 00:19:56,359
You'II do what?

287
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,362
If it takes kids to be with you,
then kids it is.

288
00:20:00,464 --> 00:20:01,488
Oh, my God.

289
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:07,269
If I have to, I'II do it aII again.
I'II do the 4:00 feeding thing.

290
00:20:07,371 --> 00:20:11,364
I'II go to the PTA meetings.
I'II coach the soccer team.

291
00:20:12,376 --> 00:20:14,469
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah, if I have to.

292
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,372
Monica...

293
00:20:19,516 --> 00:20:22,280
...I don't wanna Iose you.

294
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:25,411
So if I have to do it aII again...

295
00:20:25,522 --> 00:20:27,387
...then I wiII.

296
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:33,295
You are the most wonderfuI man.

297
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:37,290
And if you hadn't said...

298
00:20:37,334 --> 00:20:40,531
...''If I have to,'' Iike, 1 7 times...

299
00:20:42,306 --> 00:20:44,604
...then I'd be saying,
''Okay, Iet's do it.''

300
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,307
But you're not.

301
00:20:50,514 --> 00:20:55,417
Oh, my God. I can't beIieve
what I'm getting ready to say.

302
00:20:59,456 --> 00:21:01,447
I wanna have a baby.

303
00:21:04,495 --> 00:21:09,455
But I don't want to have one with
someone who doesn't reaIIy want one.

304
00:21:11,468 --> 00:21:13,299
God....

305
00:21:18,475 --> 00:21:20,306
I Iove you.

306
00:21:25,282 --> 00:21:26,510
I know you do.

307
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,285
Me too.

308
00:21:38,295 --> 00:21:39,523
So what now?

309
00:21:41,532 --> 00:21:43,523
I guess we just...

310
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:46,401
...keep dancing.

311
00:22:01,285 --> 00:22:02,479
Where is she?
Where is she?

312
00:22:03,253 --> 00:22:06,245
Oh, hey, I have a question.
Where is she?

313
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:09,350
ReIax, ChandIer.
She'II be here.

314
00:22:12,363 --> 00:22:13,352
Oh, that's her.

315
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:17,263
Yeah, because Iife's just that kind.

316
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:19,469
Stop staring at the door.

317
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:21,401
It's Iike a watched pot.

318
00:22:21,472 --> 00:22:25,465
If you keep Iooking at it,
the door's never gonna boiI.

319
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:28,501
I think what you have to do
is try not to--

320
00:22:34,418 --> 00:22:36,318
Oh, my God.

321
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:40,313
Oh...

322
00:22:40,524 --> 00:22:42,321
...my...

323
00:22:42,493 --> 00:22:44,290
...God.

324
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:54,395
Oh...

325
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:55,494
...my...

326
00:22:55,606 --> 00:22:57,301
...God.

327
00:23:05,449 --> 00:23:06,438
AII right.

328
00:23:07,351 --> 00:23:10,377
I've feIt guiIty because
I wanna be a good friend.

329
00:23:10,454 --> 00:23:14,550
And damn it, I am a good friend.
So shut up and cIose your eyes.

330
00:23:18,295 --> 00:23:19,455
Wow.

331
00:23:20,497 --> 00:23:22,488
You are a good friend.

332
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:26,395
Of course, the audition's over,
and I didn't get it.

333
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:29,496
But that was a heII of a kiss.

334
00:23:30,274 --> 00:23:32,504
RacheI is a very Iucky girI.
