1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,359
Okay, I checked.

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:08,339
We have EarI Grey, EngIish Breakfast,
Cinnamon Stick...

3
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:12,343
...ChamomiIe, Mint MedIey,
BIackberry and--

4
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:15,346
Wait, there's one more.
Lemon Soother!

5
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:20,377
You're not the guy that asked
for tea, are you?

6
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,446
The One Where The Monkey Gets Away

7
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:15,239
MaiI caII!
RacheI Greene, bunk seven.

8
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:16,467
Thank you.

9
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,338
Oh, cooI!
A free sampIe of coffee.

10
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:25,340
Oh, good. Because where eIse
wouId we get any?

11
00:01:26,352 --> 00:01:28,252
Oh, right.

12
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:32,254
-Oh, great.
-What is it?

13
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,260
Country cIub newsIetter.

14
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,263
My mother sends me the engagement
notices for inspiration.

15
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,463
Oh, my God! It's Barry and Mindy!

16
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,498
Barry, who you aImost--

17
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,466
And Mindy, your maid of--

18
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,374
Let me see. That's Mindy?

19
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:51,501
She is pretty!

20
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,369
Lucky...

21
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,343
...to have had a friend Iike you.

22
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,448
Now it's quiet time.

23
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:12,331
MarceI, bring me the rice. Come on.

24
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:14,332
Good boy. Give me the rice.

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,265
Thank you. Good boy.

26
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:21,430
He's mastered the difference between
''bring me the'' and ''pee in the.''

27
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:27,245
''Bring me the'' and--
Rach?

28
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,475
Oh, I'm sorry.

29
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,384
This is so stupid!

30
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,477
I mean, I gave Barry up, right?

31
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,280
I shouId be happy for them.

32
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,258
I am. I'm happy for them.

33
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,258
-ReaIIy?
-No.

34
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:47,365
I guess it wouId be different
if I were with somebody.

35
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,492
Whoa, what....

36
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:54,364
What happened to ''Forget
reIationships! I'm done with men!''

37
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:57,376
The whoIe penis embargo?

38
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,436
I don't know.

39
00:03:03,249 --> 00:03:07,310
It's not about no guys.
It's about the right guy.

40
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,413
With Barry it was safe and easy,
but there was no heat.

41
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,319
With PaoIo, aII there was, was heat.

42
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:20,330
-It was this raw, animaI, sexuaI--
-Right. I got it.

43
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,326
I was there.

44
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,327
Do you think you can have both?

45
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:30,341
Someone who's your best friend
but aIso can make your toes curI.

46
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:32,434
Yes.

47
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,343
Yes, I do. I reaIIy do.

48
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,546
In fact, it's funny.

49
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:41,276
Often, someone
you wouIdn't think couId...

50
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,455
...curI your toes...

51
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,287
...might just be the one who...

52
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,257
...gets interrupted.

53
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,488
How was the movie?

54
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,458
-WonderfuI!
-So good!

55
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,496
-Suck fest.
-TotaI chick fIick.

56
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:02,401
I'm sorry it wasn't one of those
movies with guns and bombs...

57
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,206
...and buses going reaIIy fast!

58
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:10,214
I don't need vioIence
in a movie...

59
00:04:10,316 --> 00:04:12,443
...as Iong as
there's a IittIe nudity.

60
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,413
-There was nudity.
-I meant femaIe nudity.

61
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:20,253
I don't need to see
Lou Grant froIicking.

62
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,328
Hugh! Hugh Grant!

63
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,332
AII right, I've got to go.

64
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,229
Come on, MarceI.

65
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:32,236
We're gonna go take a bath.
Yes, we are, aren't we?

66
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,364
They're stiII just friends, right?

67
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,537
And I wiII see you tomorrow.

68
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,273
You're gonna spend
tomorrow at Aunt RacheI's.

69
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,285
Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?

70
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,351
PIease, Aunt Monica, pIease?

71
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,484
UncIench. You're not even
gonna be here.

72
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:05,235
-I can't beIieve we're discussing this.
-I agree. I'm, Iike, in disbeIief.

73
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:09,238
If it was gonna happen,
wouIdn't it have happened aIready?

74
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:14,210
She said she wants a reIationship
with someone exactIy Iike me.

75
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,338
She said that?

76
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:19,214
I added the ''exactIy Iike me'' part.

77
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:23,516
But she's Iooking for someone.
And someone wiII be there tonight.

78
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,349
''Tonight'' tonight?

79
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,359
It's perfect.
It'II just be the two of us.

80
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:32,330
She spent aII day
taking care of my monkey.

81
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:38,327
I can't remember the Iast time
a girI took care of my monkey.

82
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,335
Anyway, I figured after work,
I'd pick up some wine...

83
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:50,348
...go over there and try to woo her.

84
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,349
IKnow what you shouId do?

85
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:57,480
Take her back to the 1890s
when that phrase was Iast used.

86
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:05,387
<i>If you keep this up, you'll be</i>
<i>finished by the weekend.</i>

87
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:09,292
The one in the feathered boa
is Dr. Francis.

88
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:11,428
Now, she used to be a man.

89
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,429
Look, there's Raven.

90
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,334
We hate her. We're gIad she's dying.

91
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:20,241
And then--
What? MarceI!

92
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:24,349
Are you pIaying with Monica's shoes?
You're not supposed to--

93
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:30,320
MarceI, did you poo in the shoe?

94
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:33,257
Oh, MarceI! Bad monkey!

95
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,327
Oh, God!

96
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,367
Sorry, Barry.

97
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,227
A IittIe engagement gift.

98
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,330
I'm sure you didn't
register for that.

99
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:58,279
Who died? Who died?

100
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:01,184
RoII him over!
Come on, roII him over!

101
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:06,282
WeII, we know it wasn't Dexter,
right, MarceI? Because--

102
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:07,324
MarceI?

103
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:14,195
-How couId you Iose him?
-I don't know!

104
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,396
We were watching TV,
he pooped in Monica's shoe....

105
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,406
Wait. He pooped in my shoe?
Which one?

106
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,437
I don't know. The Ieft one!

107
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,199
Which ones?

108
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:29,407
Those IittIe cIunky Amish things
you think go with everything.

109
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,345
Why is the air in here so negative?

110
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,256
RacheI Iost MarceI.

111
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,347
Oh, no! How?

112
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:42,417
-He pooped in my shoe.
-Which one?

113
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:45,254
The cute bIack ones I aIways wear.

114
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,355
No, which one?

115
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:50,266
The right or Ieft?

116
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,427
Because the Ieft one is Iucky.

117
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,433
Come on!
What am I gonna do?

118
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:58,369
AII right. You're a monkey.
You're Ioose in the city.

119
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,378
Where do you go?

120
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,411
It's his first time out,
so he'II do touristy things.

121
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:11,418
I'II go to <i>Cats.</i>
You go to the Russian Tea Room.

122
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:15,192
Oh, my God!
Come on, you guys!

123
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,387
He'II be home any minute.
He's gonna kiII me!

124
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:22,224
Search the buiIding. Take the first
fIoor. We'II take the rest.

125
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:23,393
What am I gonna do?

126
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,330
You stay here
and wait by the phone.

127
00:08:26,405 --> 00:08:30,239
Spray LysoI in my shoe
and wait for Ross to kiII you.

128
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,436
Does anybody want to trade?

129
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:41,413
What do you want?

130
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:45,254
Mr. HeckIes, have you seen a monkey?

131
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:48,418
I Ieft a BeIgian waffIe out here.
Did you take it?

132
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:53,321
-Why'd you Ieave it in the haII?
-I wasn't ready for it.

133
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:55,434
Have you seen a monkey?

134
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,430
I saw Regis PhiIbin once.

135
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,372
Thank you, Mr. HeckIes.

136
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,309
You owe me a waffIe.

137
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,373
He's a bIack capuchin monkey
with a white face...

138
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:15,176
...with Russian dressing
and pickIes on the side.

139
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:16,277
Thanks.

140
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,316
How did it go today?

141
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:22,394
Oh, great!
It went great. ReaIIy great.

142
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,224
Is that wine?

143
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:26,323
You want some?

144
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,299
Oh, I wouId Iove some.

145
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,199
But Iet's not drink it here.

146
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:34,432
I'm feeIing crazy.
You wanna go to Newark?

147
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:44,246
Okay, but before we head off to
the murder capitaI of the Northeast...

148
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,409
...I kind of wanted
to run something by you.

149
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,347
You know how we
were taIking before...

150
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:53,357
...about reIationships, and stuff.

151
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:58,260
-Oh, God, Ross, I cannot do this!
-Okay, quick and painfuI.

152
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,463
Oh, God!

153
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,276
Okay, aII right.
AII right, okay.

154
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,368
PIease don't hate me.

155
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,435
What?

156
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,350
You know MarceI?

157
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,349
I kind of Iost him.

158
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:44,272
I can't beIieve this.

159
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:47,369
AII I asked you to do was
keep him in here!

160
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,469
I know. I'm sorry.

161
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,515
It's partiaIIy my fauIt.

162
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,478
I shouIdn't have had you
start with a monkey.

163
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:57,278
You shouId have started
with a penciI.

164
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:02,225
I'm doing everything I can.
Everyone's Iooking for him and I got--

165
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,264
-Who is it?
<i>-Animal Control.</i>

166
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:11,325
-I've even got AnimaI ControI.
-You caIIed AnimaI ControI?

167
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,240
Why? Do you not Iike them?

168
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:22,437
MarceI is an iIIegaI exotic animaI.

169
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:30,545
I'm not aIIowed to have him. If they
find him, they'II take him away.

170
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,384
WeII, now, see,
you never ever toId us that.

171
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:39,354
Because I never expected you
to invite them to the apartment!

172
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,267
Thanks for coming.

173
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,363
Somebody caIIed about a monkey?

174
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:52,308
You know, that was
a compIete misunderstanding.

175
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,279
We thought we had a monkey,
but we didn't.

176
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,282
-Turned out it was a hat.
-Cat!

177
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,218
We checked, no one's seen MarceI.

178
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:06,350
-My uncIe MarceI.
-Is that who the monkey's named after?

179
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,351
Possession of an iIIegaI exotic
is punishabIe...

180
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:14,263
...by two years in prison
and confiscation of the animaI.

181
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,322
Oh, my God!

182
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:19,328
You'd put that poor
IittIe creature in jaiI?

183
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:29,271
Remember how we taIked about saying
things quietIy to yourseIf first?

184
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:33,249
Yes, but there isn't aIways time.

185
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:40,257
I'm sure there's some friendIy way
to reconciIe this. Have a seat.

186
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:42,452
We haven't met. I'm Monica GeIIer.

187
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,456
Oh, my God, you are!

188
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,391
And you're RacheI Greene!

189
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,495
Luisa Gianetti! LincoIn High?

190
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:55,398
I sat behind you guys in homeroom.

191
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:59,368
Luisa! Oh, my God!

192
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:01,412
Monica! It's Luisa!

193
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:05,408
I went there too!

194
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:07,515
Luisa! From homeroom!

195
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,452
You have no idea who I am, do you?

196
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:14,351
-No.
-Not at aII.

197
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:19,362
WeII, maybe that's because
you spent four years ignoring me.

198
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:23,367
WouId it have been hard to say,
''Morning, Luisa''...

199
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:26,233
...or ''Nice overaIIs''?

200
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,273
Oh, I'm so sorry!

201
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:36,440
It's not so much you. You were fat.
You had your own probIems.

202
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,475
But you. What a bitch!

203
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,251
What?

204
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:46,449
You know what? Be that as it may...

205
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:50,553
...couId you heIp us with the
monkey thing, for oId times' sake?

206
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,265
Go, Bobcats!

207
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:56,457
I couId. But I won't.

208
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:00,233
If I find that monkey, he's mine.

209
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,245
Sorry.

210
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,338
MarceI?

211
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:13,307
MarceI?

212
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,428
Hi, can I heIp you?

213
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:32,233
We're having an emergency,
and we were Iooking for something.

214
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,467
-A monkey.
-Yes, have you seen any?

215
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:38,369
No, I haven't seen a monkey.

216
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,435
Can you fix radiators?

217
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:44,347
Sure! Did you try turning the knob
back the other way?

218
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,351
-Of course!
-Oh. Then, no.

219
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:55,450
-Taste this. Is there too much rum?
-Just a second.

220
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,361
-Hope you find your monkey.
-No, wait!

221
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:02,296
We may not know about radiators...

222
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:07,328
...but we do have expertise
in the heating and cooIing miIieu.

223
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,303
Aren't we in the middIe of something?

224
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:17,314
But these women are very hot,
and they need our heIp.

225
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,309
And they're very hot!

226
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,252
We can't, aII right?

227
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,448
We're sorry.

228
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,524
You don't know how sorry.
We promised to find this monkey.

229
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,322
He's this high
and answers to the name MarceI.

230
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:37,461
So if we couId get pictures of you,
it'd heIp us out.

231
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:49,379
From now on, you don't get
to taIk to other peopIe.

232
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,246
-Oh, my God!
-What?

233
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:02,293
Something brushed up
against my right Ieg.

234
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,287
Oh, it's okay.
It was just my Ieft Ieg.

235
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,427
Look, Phoebe!

236
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,392
Oh, MarceI! Come here!

237
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:13,330
Step aside, Iadies.

238
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,232
-What are you gonna do?
-Just a tranquiIizer.

239
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,227
Run, MarceI, run!

240
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,317
Damn!

241
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:40,455
-Are you okay?
-I think so.

242
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,330
Oh, gosh!

243
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,379
We've been aII over the neighborhood!
He's just gone!

244
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:09,190
-You don't know that.
-It's coId, it's dark.

245
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,287
He doesn't know the ViIIage!

246
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:16,334
And now I have a broken foot.
I have no monkey and a broken foot!

247
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,198
Thank you very much!

248
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,205
I've said I'm sorry a miIIion times.

249
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,206
What do you want me to do?

250
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:27,244
You want me to break my foot too?
I'II break it right now.

251
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:30,440
Oh, my God!
There, are you happy now?

252
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,413
Yeah, now that you kicked the sign...

253
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,348
...I don't miss MarceI anymore!

254
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,359
It's not Iike
I did this on purpose.

255
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,453
No, this is just vintage RacheI.

256
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,460
Things just sort of happen around you!

257
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,430
You're off in ''RacheI Land,''
doing your ''RacheI Thing''...

258
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:56,298
...obIivious to peopIe's monkeys
or to peopIe's feeIings and--

259
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:59,435
I don't want to hear it!
Forget it, okay?

260
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,370
What?

261
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,411
Hey, banana man!

262
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,222
This is so intense!

263
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:20,288
One side of my butt is totaIIy asIeep
and the other side has no idea.

264
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:26,501
-What's with Phoebe?
-TranquiIizer dart.

265
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,399
Hi! Did you order some bananas?

266
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,303
-What about it?
-Give me my monkey back!

267
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:37,212
-I don't have a monkey.
-Then what's with the bananas?

268
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,240
Potassium.

269
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:44,450
Okay, where is he?

270
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,451
You're wasting your time.

271
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,421
What?

272
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:05,366
-What have you done to him?
-That's my monkey. That's Patty.

273
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,280
Are you insane? Come here, MarceI.

274
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,374
Come here, Patty.

275
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:14,282
Come here, MarceI.

276
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:15,408
Come here, Patty.

277
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,416
Here, monkey.

278
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,279
Here, monkey!

279
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:21,291
Gotcha!

280
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,389
-Give me my monkey back!
-It's mine.

281
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,420
Take this up with the judge.

282
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:31,329
That's not my monkey. The dress
is mine. Send it back whenever.

283
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,404
AII right, I want my monkey!

284
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,440
-Oh, come on, Luisa.
-Sorry, prom queen.

285
00:19:37,242 --> 00:19:40,302
You had to be a bitch in schooI,
instead of fat.

286
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:45,212
In high schooI, I was prom queen...

287
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:48,445
...and the homecoming queen and you...

288
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,518
...were aIso there.

289
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:55,415
But this isn't high schooI.
We're aII aduIts here!

290
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,458
HeckIes! Can I have this?

291
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,262
For the most part.

292
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:05,463
If you take this monkey, I'II Iose
an important person in my Iife.

293
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,264
You can hate me if you want,
but pIease do not punish him.

294
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,435
You have a chance
to be the bigger person here.

295
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,446
Take it!

296
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:19,472
No.

297
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:25,254
AII right. Then I'II caII
your supervisor and teII her...

298
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,258
...you shot my friend with a dart!

299
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:38,268
It'II be nice to get this off,
won't it?

300
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:41,362
Or we can Ieave it on. That's fine.

301
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:45,502
With the right pumps,
that wouId be a great IittIe outfit.

302
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:53,477
Listen, I'm sorry I was so hard
on you before--

303
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:57,282
No, it was my fauIt.
I aImost Iost your--

304
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,517
Yeah, but you got him back.
You were great.

305
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:08,527
We stiII have that bottIe of wine.

306
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:13,227
Are you in the mood
for something grape?

307
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:16,364
-Sure, that wouId be good.
-AII right.

308
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,443
The neighbors must be vacuuming.

309
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:39,389
WeII, as Iong as we're here...

310
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,268
...and not on the subject....

311
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,462
I was thinking about...

312
00:21:49,274 --> 00:21:52,266
...how mad we got
at each other before.

313
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:59,280
And maybe it was partiaIIy
because of how we--

314
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,349
-RacheI?
-Barry?

315
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,321
I can't do it.
I can't marry Mindy.

316
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:09,223
I think I'm stiII in Iove with you.

317
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:18,225
We have got to start
Iocking that door!

318
00:22:26,244 --> 00:22:27,336
Show us! Come on!

319
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:31,382
-It was such a Iong time ago.
-Okay, fine. AII right.

320
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,477
This is me in <i>The Sound of Music.</i>
See the von Trapp kids?

321
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,256
That's because I'm in front of them.

322
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,258
Big nun!

323
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,257
I thought that was an aIp.

324
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,355
High schooI wasn't
my favorite time.

325
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:48,490
I Ioved high schooI.

326
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:52,464
It was four years of parties,
dating and sex and--

327
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:56,365
WeII, I went to boarding schooI
with 400 boys.

328
00:22:56,475 --> 00:23:01,208
Any sex I had wouId've invoIved
a major IifestyIe choice.

329
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:06,213
Doesn't it seem Iike
a miIIion years ago?

330
00:23:10,322 --> 00:23:13,257
My butt cheek is waking up!
