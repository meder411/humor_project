1
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,467
I'II get candIes
and my mom's tabIecIoth.

2
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:15,270
And since it's RacheI's birthday,
I thought I'd poach a saImon.

3
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,372
What?

4
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:20,442
Question: Why do we aIways
have parties where you poach things?

5
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:22,387
Wanna be on the food committee?

6
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:25,447
Question two: Why do we
have committees?

7
00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:30,251
Why can't we just get pizzas
and beers and have fun?

8
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:34,356
Fancy parties are onIy fun
if you're fancy on the inside.

9
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:37,370
And I'm not sure we are.

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,268
You don't want it to be speciaI.

11
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,500
You can throw
any kind of party you want.

12
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,402
Joey, they're not reaI!

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,374
I start miIes beneath these things.
They're fake.

14
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,284
See? Honk, honk!

15
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,583
Wow, it's Iike porno for cIowns!

16
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,325
The One With the Two Parties

17
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,305
Neither of RacheI's sisters can come.

18
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:51,502
I have to invite DyIan
and Emma and Shannon Cooper.

19
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:55,481
-No Shannon Cooper.
-Why not her?

20
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,477
Because she....
She steaIs stuff.

21
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:06,418
Or maybe she doesn't and Joey sIept
with her and never caIIed her back.

22
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,455
Joey, that is horribIe.

23
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:14,360
Hey, I Iiked her, aII right?
Maybe too much. I don't know.

24
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,231
I guess I just got scared.

25
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,239
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

26
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:24,267
I didn't think anyone
wouId buy that. Okay!

27
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:28,475
-Hi, honey. How'd it go?
-It was the graduation from heII.

28
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:32,480
My cousin went to heII
on a footbaII schoIarship.

29
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,446
It's supposed to be a joyous occasion.

30
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,480
Nobody thought my sister
wouId graduate.

31
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:43,456
It's a testament to what a girI
from Long IsIand wiII do for a CeIica.

32
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,457
-What happened?
-My parents happened.

33
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,501
AII they had to do was sit
and smiIe...

34
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:53,363
...and not taIk about the divorce.
But no!

35
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:56,375
They fought during
the commencement address.

36
00:02:56,476 --> 00:03:01,345
Bishop Tutu actuaIIy had
to stop and shush them.

37
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,246
You know the good news?

38
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,343
I get to serve coffee
for eight hours.

39
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,315
So we don't invite her parents.

40
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,224
-How about just her mom?
-Why her mom?

41
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,420
Because I aIready invited her.

42
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,463
Did you ask Stacy Roth?

43
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,358
Can't invite her.

44
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:26,237
She aIso steaIs.

45
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,437
So does her roommate.

46
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,481
Here are the candIes.
Where's the cake?

47
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:46,351
We're not having birthday cake.
We're having birthday fIan.

48
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,284
Excuse me?

49
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:52,262
-It's a Mexican custard dessert.
-That's nice.

50
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:55,461
Happy birthday, RacheI.
Here's some goo!

51
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,307
Dr. Greene!

52
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:07,209
Oh, my God!
It's RacheI's dad.

53
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,313
What are you doing here?

54
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,316
A father can't see
the daughter on her birthday?

55
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:14,320
No, no, the father can.

56
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:18,313
But since I'm the roommate,
I can teII you she's not here.

57
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,450
And I'II pass aIong the message.
So bye-bye.

58
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,355
You're having a party.

59
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,227
No, no, not a party.

60
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:30,234
Just a surprise gathering
of some peopIe RacheI knows.

61
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,535
-This is Phoebe, ChandIer and Joey.
-I won't remember that.

62
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,365
So what's the deaI?

63
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:40,378
RacheI comes home,
peopIe pop out and yeII stuff?

64
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:44,348
This isn't your first
surprise party, is it, sir?

65
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,244
Hi, Monica.

66
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,449
The Chinese menu guy.
Forgot the menus.

67
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:58,396
So basicaIIy, just a Chinese guy.

68
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:04,293
Dr. Greene, come with me.
We'II put your jacket on RacheI's bed.

69
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:10,198
AII right.
That sounds Iike a two-person job.

70
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,438
WeII, my goodness!
What was that?

71
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:18,411
I thought you were RacheI.
We weren't ready for you yet.

72
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:22,420
-You thought I was RacheI?
-Because you Iook so young.

73
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:27,221
And because you're both,
you know, white women.

74
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:33,324
Oh, I missed you kids.
ShouId I put my coat in the bedroom?

75
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:38,233
-No, I'II take that for you.
-WeII, thank you.

76
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,363
Such a gentIeman. Thank you.

77
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:48,346
It aII Iooks so nice.
So festive. AII the baIIoons.

78
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:51,544
Oh, the funniest thing happened
to me on the way here.

79
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,446
-I was driving--
-That's great!

80
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:02,187
I can't wait to hear it,
but I have to go to the bathroom.

81
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,286
-Hey, come with me.
-What?

82
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:10,291
Like we're gaI paIs. Like at
a restaurant. It'II be fun! Come on.

83
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,336
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
-Think. Think.

84
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:21,312
What wouId Jack and Chrissy do?

85
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:26,248
Okay, now that your coat
is safeIy in the bed--

86
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:28,445
We can come back
to the Iiving room.

87
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:33,318
Joey and ChandIer, it's time
you take Dr. Greene over to your pIace.

88
00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:36,361
Yes, absoIuteIy.

89
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,420
Why, again?

90
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:43,258
Because that's where
the party is, you goon!

91
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:47,329
-This is the staging area.
-Right, it's the staging area.

92
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,467
This is cIearIy
in the wrong apartment.

93
00:06:55,448 --> 00:07:00,215
AII right, you guys are off
to party number one.

94
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:02,217
And you....

95
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,290
You are off to party number two.

96
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:09,283
Let's keep it moving,
Iet's keep it moving.

97
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:14,496
CouId you at Ieast send
some women to my party?

98
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:18,336
Okay, that's Ross. AII right.

99
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,235
Okay, they're coming.

100
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,406
Thank you for a wonderfuI dinner.

101
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,250
Thanks for being born.

102
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:37,312
Thank you for my beautifuI earrings.
They're perfect. I Iove you.

103
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:41,325
Now, you can exchange them
if you want, okay?

104
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,329
Now I Iove you even more.

105
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:50,429
Surprise!

106
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,338
Oh, my gosh! Wow! Monica!

107
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,466
Oh, my God. Mom!
This is so great!

108
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,303
Happy birthday, sweetie.

109
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:04,281
You! I had no idea!

110
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,180
-ReaIIy?
-No, I knew.

111
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,219
AII right.

112
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,380
There's food and drinks on the tabIe.

113
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,385
Go across the haII.
Now, Joey and ChandIer's.

114
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,421
-Why?
-Just go.

115
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:18,385
Weird.

116
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,296
Surprise!

117
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,395
Happy birthday, sweet pea.

118
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,433
Daddy!

119
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:38,240
Both of them are here?
Both of them are here?

120
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:42,344
-WeII, we couId count again?
-I can't beIieve this.

121
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:46,414
This is ridicuIous.
This is your birthday, your party.

122
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:50,252
Put them together.
If they can't deaI with it, who cares?

123
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,321
-I do.
-That's who.

124
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,425
WiII you be okay?

125
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:59,432
I don't reaIIy have a choice.
I can Iook at the bright side.

126
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,401
I get two birthday parties
and two cakes.

127
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,305
WeII, actuaIIy,
just one birthday fIan.

128
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:10,170
What?

129
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,185
It's a traditionaI
Mexican custard dessert.

130
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:17,178
TaIk to Monica.
She's on the food committee.

131
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:26,230
A girI waIked up to me
and said, ''I want you, Dennis''...

132
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:29,200
...and stuck her tongue
down my throat.

133
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,226
I Iove this party!

134
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,397
-VoIIeybaII question.
-VoIIeybaII.

135
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,197
We set up a court in your room.

136
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,405
You didn't Iike
that gray Iamp, did you?

137
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:44,246
A woman stuck her tongue down
my throat. I'm not even Iistening.

138
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:48,253
-Dennis!
-Okay, that's me.

139
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:52,357
Can you keep Dad occupied?
I'm gonna taIk to Mom for a whiIe.

140
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,326
Do you have any ideas
for any openers?

141
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:59,329
Stay cIear of ''I'm the guy
doing your daughter''...

142
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,333
...and you shouId be okay.

143
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,427
Take a piece of paper.

144
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:10,272
Here you go. And write down
your most embarrassing memory.

145
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:14,473
When you're not using the markers,
put the caps back on them...

146
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:17,374
...because they wiII dry out.

147
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,241
Hi, Dr. Greene.

148
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,256
So how's everything in the...

149
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,384
...vascuIar surgery game?

150
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:32,362
It's not a game, Ross.
A woman died on my tabIe today.

151
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:35,262
I'm sorry.

152
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,395
That's the good thing about my job.

153
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,498
AII the dinosaurs on my tabIe
are aIready dead.

154
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:47,311
I don't mean
to be a pain about this...

155
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,406
...but I've seen some of you
just pIace them on.

156
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,509
You want to push the caps...

157
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,411
...untiI you hear them cIick.

158
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,325
Gunther! Where you going?

159
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:03,260
I was sort of thinking about maybe--

160
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,355
No! No, you can't go!
No, this is fun.

161
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:10,368
We're just getting started.
Here's your marker.

162
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,362
If you want to go, just go.

163
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:18,239
No, she'II yeII at me again.

164
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:24,438
-AII right, I can get you out.
-What?

165
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,284
In a minute, I'II create a diversion.

166
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:32,381
When I do, waIk quickIy to the door
and don't Iook back.

167
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:36,251
-I think I need a drink.
-I'II get it for you.

168
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,296
-What do you want?
-Scotch.

169
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:42,493
I'II be back in 10 seconds with
your scotch on the rocks in a gIass.

170
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,363
-Neat!
-CooI.

171
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:49,407
Neat, as in no rocks.

172
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,310
I know.

173
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:59,317
HeIIo, Ross!
Where have you been?

174
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:03,219
I have been in the bathroom.

175
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:07,224
Stay cIear of the saImon mousse.

176
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,253
Scotch neat.

177
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:16,267
That's RacheI's father's drink.

178
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:19,361
Mine too. Isn't that neat?

179
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,463
Scotch neat.

180
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,473
WouId you excuse me?

181
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:35,250
Where are you sneaking off to, mister?

182
00:12:35,554 --> 00:12:38,455
-I'm getting my cigarettes.
-No.

183
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:43,360
-What do you mean no?
-See, because that's the staging area.

184
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:47,559
You go in there, it'II ruin
the whoIe iIIusion of the party.

185
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,359
Take your scotch back in there...

186
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:53,496
...and I wiII get
your cigarettes for you, sir.

187
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:58,369
-Get my gIasses too.
-AII righty-roo.

188
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:04,214
What a great moment to say that
for the first time.

189
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:11,349
Okay, the first person's
most embarrassing memory is:

190
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,324
''Monica, your party sucks.''

191
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,421
Very funny.

192
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:20,255
Oh, no! Did someone forget
to use a coaster?

193
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,266
What?

194
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,465
I don't see anything.

195
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:34,371
Great, I'm seeing water rings again.

196
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,474
Ross, whose gIasses are those?

197
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,243
Mine.

198
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:45,388
You wear bifocaIs?

199
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:52,262
I have a condition apparentIy
that I require...

200
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:55,460
...two different sets of focaIs.

201
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:59,496
Do you know my husband
has gIasses just Iike that?

202
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:02,434
WeII, those are very popuIar frames.

203
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:05,302
NeiI Sedaka wears them.

204
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,341
I hear you can get peopIe out of here.

205
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,514
You didn't teII me
your boyfriend smokes.

206
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,226
Yeah, Iike a chimney.

207
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,318
Big smoker.

208
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,458
Big, big smoker.

209
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:31,431
I'm gonna go out into the haIIway
and fire up this bad boy.

210
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:49,284
-Are you wearing my gIasses?
-Yes.

211
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:55,258
I was just warming up
the earpieces for you.

212
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,352
Thank you.

213
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,489
Is that one of my cigarettes?

214
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:12,243
Yes, it is. I was just
moistening the tip.

215
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:16,338
She's taking the trash out,
so I can get you out.

216
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,316
But it has to be now.
She'II be back soon.

217
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:20,340
And my friend?

218
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:24,253
OnIy you three.
Any more and she'II get suspicious.

219
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:28,315
-Let me just get my coat.
-There isn't time!

220
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:34,230
Just Ieave everything.
They'II take care of you next door.

221
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,325
Is it true they have beer?

222
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:40,271
Everything you've heard is true.

223
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,237
CouId you guys pIease keep it down?

224
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,335
We're trying to start
a BoggIe tournament.

225
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,472
If peopIe find out
they're pIaying speIIing games...

226
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,274
...there'II be nobody Ieft here.

227
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:59,252
You!
And you.

228
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:04,285
You're supposed to be at my party.
And Gunther!

229
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,425
What are you doing here?

230
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,331
WeIcome to the f--

231
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:22,304
I'm sorry.
But these peopIe needed me.

232
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:28,218
They work hard aII week. It's Saturday.
They deserve to have fun. Go!

233
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,223
You know, my party is fun. It's
a quieter, Iess obvious sort of fun.

234
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:36,421
But if peopIe wouId just
give it a chance, it's--

235
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:45,267
-You want me to see a therapist?
-Sweetheart, you have a probIem.

236
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:49,239
You've chosen a boyfriend
exactIy Iike your father.

237
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,339
Okay, Mom, I'II make an appointment.

238
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:55,438
But right now, I gotta go.
I gotta go do a thing.

239
00:16:55,547 --> 00:17:01,179
Did you know your mother
spent $1 200 on bonsai trees?

240
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,381
I feIt Iike GuIIiver
around that pIace.

241
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:10,219
Daddy, I want to hear more about this,
but I just have to do some stuff.

242
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:13,287
You work and work
and work at a marriage...

243
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:16,197
...but aII he cares about
is his boat.

244
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:19,203
You work and work
and work on a boat.

245
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:22,240
He aIways ridicuIed my pottery cIasses.

246
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,309
And you sand it and varnish it.

247
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,244
But when aII's said and done,
he drinks out of the mugs.

248
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:31,339
A night of her yoga
and <i>Bridges of Madison County....</i>

249
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:34,318
<i>-Scotch, cigarettes....</i>
<i>-The bonsais, Chihuahua....</i>

250
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:37,287
<i>I've been in therapy</i>
<i>for three weeks but--</i>

251
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:40,325
<i>What the hell does she want</i>
<i>with half a boat?</i>

252
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,456
Okay, okay, you can be shirts
and I'II be skins.

253
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,225
I'II be skins!

254
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:59,377
How you hoIding up there, tiger?

255
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:05,214
Sorry. When my parents got divorced,
I got a Iot of ''tigers.''

256
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:08,412
I got a Iot of ''champs,''
''chiefs,'' ''sports.''

257
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:11,382
I even got a ''governor.''

258
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:16,225
This is it, isn't it?
This is what my Iife wiII be Iike.

259
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:21,332
My mom there, my dad there.
Thanksgiving, Christmas.

260
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,202
She gets the house, he's in a condo
my sister wiII decorate with wicker.

261
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:31,208
ChandIer, how did you
get through this?

262
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:36,406
I reIied on a carefuIIy
regimented program of deniaI...

263
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:40,241
...and wetting the bed.

264
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,320
You know, I just--
It's so weird.

265
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:49,225
I mean, I was in there just Iistening
to them bitch about each other.

266
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:53,355
AII I kept thinking about
was the Fourth of JuIy.

267
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:58,369
It reminded you of the way our
forefathers bitched at each other?

268
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,206
It's just this thing.
Every year we wouId...

269
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:05,209
...go on my dad's boat
and watch fireworks.

270
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:09,371
Mom aIways hated it because
the ocean air made her hair aII big.

271
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:13,212
My sister JiII wouId be
throwing up over the side...

272
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:16,277
...and Dad wouId be upset
because nobody heIped.

273
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:21,189
And when we heIped, he'd scream
at us for doing it wrong.

274
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:27,229
But then when the fireworks started,
everybody just shut up.

275
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,392
You know, and it'd get reaIIy coId.

276
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:33,335
And we'd aII just sort of smoosh
under this one bIanket.

277
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:37,398
It never occurred to anybody
to bring another one.

278
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,311
And now it's....

279
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:46,315
Yeah, I know.

280
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,433
Thanks for coming.
Hope you had fun.

281
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:16,242
AII right, I'm hitting the road.
I've Ieft my 10 verbs on the tabIe.

282
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,442
Be sure and send me
that finished poem.

283
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,474
Okay, wiII do. GIad you came.

284
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:25,246
-I think I saw RacheI out in the haII?
-Let me check.

285
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:31,258
-Your mom wants to say goodbye.
-Happy birthday, sweetie.

286
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,290
You drive safe.

287
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,366
What are you doing?

288
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:43,304
I'm getting ready
for the water-skiing.

289
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:47,277
Okay, big hug. One more.
Come on, big hug!

290
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,505
How are you?

291
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,309
-Where are you going?
-For my coat.

292
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,284
We'II get it for you.

293
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:59,414
AII right, aII right.
I can get my own coat.

294
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,332
Sorry, we're on a major fIan high.

295
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,535
Oh, no. No, you're not
supposed to be here.

296
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:19,267
This is the staging area.
It's wrong. You shouId Ieave.

297
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:22,438
You know, just get out.

298
00:21:30,355 --> 00:21:34,257
Or perhaps you'd Iike
a crème de menthe.

299
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,384
I have to head to my chateau.

300
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,396
I guess we're going
into the haIIway again.

301
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,399
Thanks for coming, Mrs. Greene.

302
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,279
Okay.

303
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:57,280
You take care.

304
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:02,216
Oh, you kids.

305
00:22:04,222 --> 00:22:05,450
WeII.

306
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:10,361
This is the best party
I've been to in years.

307
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,363
Thank you!

308
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,461
Okay, everybody, time for fIan!

309
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:24,265
Yep! Get ready
for the geIatinous fun.

310
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:27,539
Looks Iike what you get
when you get an infection.

311
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,474
Okay, that's enough.

312
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:33,445
Okay, RacheI,
make a speciaI fIan wish.

313
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,379
Okay, I've got one.

314
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,249
Heads up!

315
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:47,356
Wow! Those things aImost
never come true.

316
00:22:51,487 --> 00:22:54,513
ChandIer, Mon, there's onIy
one muffin Ieft.

317
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:57,718
-I ordered mine first.
-Yeah, but I'm so much faster.

318
00:22:59,595 --> 00:23:01,620
-Give it to me.
-No.

319
00:23:02,531 --> 00:23:04,499
Give it to me!

320
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,693
Okay, you can have it.

321
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:17,506
There you go. Enjoy your coffee.

322
00:23:17,613 --> 00:23:20,514
That was there when I got here.

323
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:26,520
Hey, you'II never guess
who's coming to New York.

324
00:23:26,622 --> 00:23:28,613
TeII us before he can swaIIow.

325
00:23:28,724 --> 00:23:31,625
Ryan, that guy I dated
who's in the Navy.

326
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,653
You dated a guy in the Navy?

327
00:23:34,764 --> 00:23:37,562
I met him whiIe pIaying guitar.

328
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:40,727
Ryan threw in saItwater taffy.
He had no change.

329
00:23:41,537 --> 00:23:44,631
Is that when you wrote
''SaItwater Taffy Man''?

330
00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:49,670
He's my submarine guy.
He resurfaces every coupIe years...

331
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:52,674
...and we have an amazing
three days together.

332
00:23:52,782 --> 00:23:57,617
OnIy, he's coming for two weeks.
Two whoIe weeks, which means yea!

333
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:03,684
So, wait, this guy goes down
for, Iike, two years at a time?

334
00:24:06,495 --> 00:24:08,725
That'II teach you to Iick my muffin.

335
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:14,499
Hi.

336
00:24:14,737 --> 00:24:18,696
-Oh, no. What happened?
-Ben's got the chickenpox.

337
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:23,637
So if you haven't had it,
chances are you wiII.

338
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:25,613
-I've had it.
-I've had it.

339
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:26,704
Had it.

340
00:24:26,749 --> 00:24:30,651
I've never had it. I feeI so Ieft out.
Oh, Iook!

341
00:24:33,756 --> 00:24:35,815
The One With the Chicken Pox

342
00:25:23,706 --> 00:25:26,607
Honey, you made the bed again.

343
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:29,735
You don't have to do that.
This isn't camp.

344
00:25:30,513 --> 00:25:34,540
I guess the panty raid Iast night
was totaIIy uncaIIed for.

345
00:25:35,551 --> 00:25:40,614
Okay, I'm taking a shower. Today
I'II sing Jim Croce's ''Leroy Brown.''

346
00:25:52,668 --> 00:25:54,761
Hey, Mon, I have a question.

347
00:25:55,504 --> 00:25:58,564
Is Leroy the baddest man
in the whoIe damn town...

348
00:25:58,674 --> 00:26:01,507
...or the fattest man?

349
00:26:01,577 --> 00:26:05,604
The baddest. Or the song
wouId be ''Fat, Fat Leroy Brown.''

350
00:26:06,582 --> 00:26:08,607
What are you doing?

351
00:26:09,518 --> 00:26:12,510
I'm just waiting for you, sweetie.

352
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,681
Are you remaking the bed?

353
00:26:17,593 --> 00:26:20,687
I'm sorry. The way you did it,
it was just fine.

354
00:26:20,729 --> 00:26:23,527
Then you're redoing it because...?

355
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,533
You'II think I'm crazy.

356
00:26:25,601 --> 00:26:28,695
You're pretty much
running that risk either way.

357
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,531
Okay. You see...

358
00:26:32,641 --> 00:26:36,543
...the duvet tag shouIdn't be
at the top Ieft corner...

359
00:26:36,612 --> 00:26:39,513
...it shouId be
at the bottom right corner.

360
00:26:39,615 --> 00:26:41,708
-It's not crazy.
-I'm easing you in.

361
00:26:42,718 --> 00:26:43,707
AII right.

362
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,716
You see these fIower bIossoms?
They shouId be facing up, not down...

363
00:26:49,492 --> 00:26:53,485
...because the head of the bed
is where the sun wouId be.

364
00:26:56,599 --> 00:26:59,500
You don't Iove me anymore, do you?

365
00:27:00,669 --> 00:27:03,661
ActuaIIy, if it's possibIe,
I Iove you more.

366
00:27:04,573 --> 00:27:05,767
ReaIIy?

367
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,569
Wow. WeII, then, come on!

368
00:27:09,678 --> 00:27:13,671
I wanna show you how to foId
the toiIet paper into a point.

369
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,511
Look, if you need something...

370
00:27:19,622 --> 00:27:22,523
...I can get you a job here
as a processor.

371
00:27:22,591 --> 00:27:26,493
-Don't you need experience?
-It's not hard to Iearn.

372
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:30,488
As far as not knowing
what you're doing, you're an actor.

373
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:34,697
Act Iike a processor,
peopIe wiII think you're a processor.

374
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:37,604
Here's this morning's projections.

375
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,507
Thanks.
Scott AIexander, Joey Tribbiani.

376
00:27:40,709 --> 00:27:43,542
Joey is a feIIow processor.

377
00:27:43,746 --> 00:27:45,509
No kidding?

378
00:27:46,715 --> 00:27:48,649
Yeah.

379
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:53,688
I process. PeopIe want the processing,
I'm the one they caII.

380
00:27:54,456 --> 00:27:57,550
-Where do you work?
-WeII, I'm in between things.

381
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,460
You know, one day
you're processing, the next day...

382
00:28:01,497 --> 00:28:03,556
...not so much processing anymore.

383
00:28:04,466 --> 00:28:06,593
I toId Joey about FIeischman's group.

384
00:28:06,702 --> 00:28:08,567
FIeischman's group?

385
00:28:08,671 --> 00:28:12,573
Whatever you do,
don't touch his sandwiches.

386
00:28:15,477 --> 00:28:17,468
Are aII you processors dorks?

387
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:25,680
This Iipstick Iooks just great on you.

388
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,613
You Iook fabuIous, reaIIy.

389
00:28:28,724 --> 00:28:31,591
Yeah, are you sure? ReaIIy?

390
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:37,531
See, you Iook beautifuI.
For God's sakes, dim the Iights.

391
00:28:38,734 --> 00:28:40,599
I'm hideous!

392
00:28:40,703 --> 00:28:42,500
It's gonna be okay.

393
00:28:42,538 --> 00:28:43,698
Ryan's been underwater.

394
00:28:44,506 --> 00:28:48,602
He's just gonna be so gIad
you don't have barnacIes on your butt.

395
00:29:00,556 --> 00:29:01,682
Come in.

396
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:04,455
Hey, baby, I'm back--

397
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,653
Hey, Ryan. What's up?

398
00:29:09,465 --> 00:29:13,458
-What's going on?
-No, no. You have to stay back.

399
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:14,661
I have the pox!

400
00:29:17,573 --> 00:29:19,666
Chicken or smaII?

401
00:29:19,775 --> 00:29:24,474
Chicken, which is so ironic
considering I'm a vegetarian.

402
00:29:24,713 --> 00:29:28,581
-Why aren't you at home?
-My grandma's never had it.

403
00:29:28,717 --> 00:29:34,485
PIease teII me you have, because
oh, my God, I forgot how cute you are.

404
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,683
I'm sorry, I never had them.

405
00:29:38,727 --> 00:29:42,595
If I had one wish,
I'd go back to when I was 7...

406
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:47,601
...when Jimmy Hauser had chickenpox,
and I'd rub him aII over my face.

407
00:29:47,636 --> 00:29:51,436
Yeah, or you couId wish
that I didn't have them now.

408
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,632
Can I see your face?

409
00:29:53,442 --> 00:29:55,672
You don't wanna see a face
covered with pox.

410
00:29:56,445 --> 00:29:59,471
It couId be covered with Iox,
I wouIdn't care.

411
00:29:59,648 --> 00:30:01,479
And you hate fish.

412
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:05,452
So sweet. AII right.

413
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:07,579
Okay, aII right. You can see.

414
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,490
This is me.

415
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:16,690
Sorry!

416
00:30:17,466 --> 00:30:18,558
I am scary!

417
00:30:18,667 --> 00:30:22,660
Sorry, the Iightning was
an unfortunate coincidence.

418
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:26,666
-You Iook IoveIy! LoveIy!
-I hate this.

419
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:30,569
I had the most amazing
two weeks pIanned for us.

420
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:35,480
And everything I had in mind,
we had to be cIoser than this.

421
00:30:35,718 --> 00:30:40,621
Phoebe, I've spent the Iast eight
months in a steeI tube with men...

422
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,717
...thinking about this moment.

423
00:30:44,493 --> 00:30:46,620
I am not gonna Iet a bunch...

424
00:30:46,695 --> 00:30:48,788
...of itchy spots stand between us.

425
00:30:56,472 --> 00:30:59,669
Okay. This is the most
romantic disease I've ever had.

426
00:31:06,648 --> 00:31:09,481
-How's the first day?
-It's Iike you said.

427
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:13,647
It's mostIy just putting numbers
from one coIumn into another.

428
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:18,654
Everybody's so nice. I just had
a good taIk with that Iady, Jeannie.

429
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:22,555
Jeannie? The head
of East Coast operations?

430
00:31:22,664 --> 00:31:25,565
Turns out our kids
go to the same schooI.

431
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,561
Yeah. SmaII worId, huh?

432
00:31:31,607 --> 00:31:33,575
Weird worId.

433
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:38,476
-Your kids?
-I figure my character has kids.

434
00:31:38,747 --> 00:31:43,514
There isn't a part of that sentence
I don't need expIained.

435
00:31:43,585 --> 00:31:46,577
In acting, you need
to think about that stuff.

436
00:31:46,622 --> 00:31:49,648
My character, Joseph,
the processing guy...

437
00:31:50,425 --> 00:31:53,622
...has two IittIe girIs,
AshIey and Brittany.

438
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:58,524
AshIey copies everything
Brittany does.

439
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:06,437
WeII, invisibIe kids
can be that way sometimes.

440
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:11,738
You know, Joseph and his wife, Karen,
are thinking of having a third kid.

441
00:32:12,548 --> 00:32:14,482
You know what?

442
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,484
Just did.

443
00:32:17,452 --> 00:32:22,446
Wow, that's some pretty powerfuI
imaginary sperm you must have there.

444
00:32:33,468 --> 00:32:38,565
-Know what makes the itching worse?
-That you don't stop taIking about it?

445
00:32:39,508 --> 00:32:41,567
-Fine.
-Let's just pIay, okay?

446
00:32:42,511 --> 00:32:45,674
Good, okay. Here we go, doubIe sixes.

447
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:48,478
Here we go....

448
00:32:49,585 --> 00:32:54,488
Here we go. Come to Mama. Just getting
ready to roII the dice....

449
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:59,584
-What're you doing? Are you scratching?
-No. This is what I do for Iuck, okay?

450
00:33:00,696 --> 00:33:03,597
-You're scratching. Give me the dice.
-No.

451
00:33:03,632 --> 00:33:06,499
-Give me the dice.
-No! Here. There!

452
00:33:06,602 --> 00:33:07,694
Look, doubIe sixes!

453
00:33:09,605 --> 00:33:11,630
We can't scratch. We'II scar.

454
00:33:12,507 --> 00:33:15,704
I can't stop thinking about it.
It's just so hard.

455
00:33:16,511 --> 00:33:19,605
I wanna grab these houses
and rub them on my body.

456
00:33:19,715 --> 00:33:22,650
-No!
-Give it! Yeah, come on!

457
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:25,652
You know you want it too.
Come on.

458
00:33:25,721 --> 00:33:28,554
Let's just be bad.
It'II feeI so good.

459
00:33:28,657 --> 00:33:29,749
Come on.

460
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,528
Oh, God heIp me.

461
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:36,758
-Oh, yeah.
-Good. Now do me.

462
00:33:37,532 --> 00:33:39,762
Do my back.
Oh, come on. Harder!

463
00:33:40,569 --> 00:33:42,560
-There you go. Don't move.
-Why?

464
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:45,573
-Don't move.
-What are you...?

465
00:33:48,677 --> 00:33:51,510
Stop that! Stop that right now.

466
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:56,711
I might've expected this of Phoebe.
But, Ryan, you're a miIitary man.

467
00:33:58,587 --> 00:34:00,578
She made me do it.

468
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:02,590
That's a nice coIor on you.

469
00:34:02,691 --> 00:34:05,717
Yeah, weII, it comes in pink
and bIotchy, baby.

470
00:34:06,595 --> 00:34:09,530
I hope you get a weenie pock.

471
00:34:12,601 --> 00:34:16,503
You and MiIton have to join us
on the boat.

472
00:34:16,605 --> 00:34:20,701
-We'II make a day of it.
-That sounds IoveIy. We'II set it up.

473
00:34:20,742 --> 00:34:24,508
I better get back.
Hope the baby feeIs better.

474
00:34:24,546 --> 00:34:27,743
-Thanks. Bye-bye, Jeannie.
-Bye-bye, Joseph.

475
00:34:28,717 --> 00:34:30,514
What a phony.

476
00:34:33,522 --> 00:34:37,754
You'II teach her a Iesson when she
steps off the dock onto nothing.

477
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,754
-Hey, Mr. DougIas.
-Sir.

478
00:34:40,562 --> 00:34:44,658
Bing, I got your memo. We won't
see the report tiII next Friday?

479
00:34:44,733 --> 00:34:50,569
-My group wants the weekend for famiIy.
-I have a famiIy. I'm gonna be here.

480
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:54,472
Yeah, Bing. What's that about?

481
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,671
It's about cutting peopIe
sIack for moraIe.

482
00:35:01,483 --> 00:35:03,713
I can get some rough numbers
by Wednesday.

483
00:35:04,486 --> 00:35:06,579
Rough numbers?

484
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:11,583
This company wasn't buiIt
on rough numbers. Right, Mr. DougIas?

485
00:35:11,727 --> 00:35:14,696
Have the finaI numbers
on my desk by Tuesday.

486
00:35:14,796 --> 00:35:17,594
If you say so, sir.

487
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:20,600
Joseph's good, isn't he?

488
00:35:22,504 --> 00:35:23,630
I'm going to kiII you.

489
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:29,541
Hey, I figure Joseph's the kind of guy
who Iikes to mix it up.

490
00:35:29,611 --> 00:35:32,705
You know, get in there,
ruffIe some feathers.

491
00:35:33,749 --> 00:35:35,546
Why?

492
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:40,716
Look, I'm sorry,
but that's what Joseph does.

493
00:35:40,756 --> 00:35:45,557
Okay? If you try to puII something,
he'II caII you on it.

494
00:35:45,627 --> 00:35:47,822
''What're you trying to puII?''
he'II say.

495
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:54,464
Duct tape.

496
00:35:54,669 --> 00:35:57,661
Was I supposed to bring something too?

497
00:35:58,507 --> 00:36:02,671
This is for the scratchy twins.
I taped oven mitts to their hands.

498
00:36:03,512 --> 00:36:06,675
-You're strict.
-WeII, it's for their own good.

499
00:36:06,782 --> 00:36:11,685
You know, I Iike the way you have
efficientIy foIded this tab under.

500
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:17,488
See, in a tape emergency you couId
shave vaIuabIe seconds off your time.

501
00:36:17,626 --> 00:36:19,594
ExactIy!

502
00:36:19,728 --> 00:36:24,529
God, I Iove that I can be
totaIIy neurotic around you now.

503
00:36:24,633 --> 00:36:29,502
Don't you Iike it better with
everything on your desk perpendicuIar?

504
00:36:29,538 --> 00:36:32,598
If it's not a right angIe,
it is a wrong angIe.

505
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,633
-Very good.
-Thank you.

506
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,508
Tomorrow I'm gonna do your cIocks.

507
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:41,741
-You're gonna do what to them?
-Set them to my time.

508
00:36:44,653 --> 00:36:48,521
I'm confused.
I thought we shared time.

509
00:36:48,757 --> 00:36:54,559
No. See, in my bedroom, I set my cIock
six minutes fast. Know why?

510
00:36:54,596 --> 00:36:59,465
Because it's in a sIightIy different
time zone than the kitchen?

511
00:36:59,568 --> 00:37:01,661
-Forget it.
-No, come on, teII me.

512
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:06,464
You don't understand. You don't
have any of these obsessions.

513
00:37:06,575 --> 00:37:08,475
No, that's not true.

514
00:37:08,577 --> 00:37:10,568
Oh, yeah? TeII me one of yours.

515
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,706
Okay.

516
00:37:17,586 --> 00:37:21,716
One of my things is,
I aIways separate my sweat socks...

517
00:37:22,524 --> 00:37:25,516
...from my dress socks.

518
00:37:27,696 --> 00:37:32,497
-What if they get mixed up?
-Boy, I wouId just....

519
00:37:32,601 --> 00:37:34,592
I wouId freak out.

520
00:37:35,704 --> 00:37:37,535
You wouId not.

521
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:41,507
I can't beIieve this.
I hate this. You're too normaI.

522
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:46,513
I can't beIieve you don't have a thing.
My boyfriend doesn't have a thing.

523
00:37:46,615 --> 00:37:50,574
See, if anyone overheard that,
I didn't come off weII there.

524
00:37:56,458 --> 00:37:57,550
Hey!

525
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:03,653
-Mr. DougIas is Iooking for you.
-Why is Mr. DougIas Iooking for me?

526
00:38:04,566 --> 00:38:08,593
He has a suspicion you dropped
the baII on the Lender project.

527
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,571
Why? Why does he suspect that?

528
00:38:12,574 --> 00:38:17,568
At first, he thought it was Joseph.
But after he asked Joseph about it....

529
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:19,670
Turns out it was you.

530
00:38:20,615 --> 00:38:24,483
-I thought you shouId know.
-AII right. That's it!

531
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:28,615
Look, Joey, I reaIize this
is the roIe of a Iifetime for you...

532
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:33,490
...and if I couId just fire Joseph,
I wouId. But that's not possibIe.

533
00:38:33,595 --> 00:38:36,496
So I'm gonna have to Iet
both of you go.

534
00:38:37,499 --> 00:38:41,526
-What? Everybody Ioves Joseph.
-I don't. I hate Joseph.

535
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:44,698
I think he's a brownnosing suck-up.

536
00:38:46,508 --> 00:38:50,569
Oh, yeah? WeII, you can't fire Joseph.
He's not in your department.

537
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:59,450
AII right, okay.
So I can't fire Joseph...

538
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:02,455
...but I can sIeep with his wife.

539
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:05,582
Not Karen!

540
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:09,494
Yeah, I'm thinking about
having an affair with her.

541
00:39:09,564 --> 00:39:11,498
You know what?

542
00:39:11,566 --> 00:39:13,466
I just did.

543
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:19,470
-What the heII are you doing?
-Oh, it's not me.

544
00:39:19,574 --> 00:39:21,474
It's my character!

545
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,475
Chandie.

546
00:39:23,712 --> 00:39:27,580
The rogue processor who seduces
his coworkers' wives...

547
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:29,584
...and then Iaughs about it.

548
00:39:29,684 --> 00:39:33,484
I have her panties
right there in my drawer!

549
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:35,681
-ReaIIy?
-No, freak! She's fictionaI!

550
00:39:36,491 --> 00:39:38,584
AII right. Hey, take it easy.

551
00:39:39,494 --> 00:39:43,590
If it means that much to you,
I'II go find something eIse.

552
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:45,725
Thank you.

553
00:39:47,702 --> 00:39:51,570
It's just that I'm gonna miss Joseph.

554
00:39:51,673 --> 00:39:53,664
I Iiked him. His wife?

555
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:56,467
She was hot.

556
00:39:57,545 --> 00:40:02,448
And the kids. You know he was gonna
put in a pooI next summer.

557
00:40:05,687 --> 00:40:08,554
Take these off.
I swear I won't scratch.

558
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:11,455
No, sorry, hon. Monica's orders.

559
00:40:13,461 --> 00:40:15,554
WeII, that wasn't easy.

560
00:40:16,531 --> 00:40:18,658
Okay, dinner's on.

561
00:40:19,467 --> 00:40:21,560
There's a peach cobbIer
in the oven.

562
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:26,505
So the pIate's gonna be hot, but that
shouIdn't be a probIem for you.

563
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:29,500
AII right, you kids. Bye, now.

564
00:40:29,577 --> 00:40:31,545
-Bye.
-Oh, Iook.

565
00:40:31,613 --> 00:40:33,547
A Iow-budget puppet show.

566
00:40:35,617 --> 00:40:39,519
It's a shame you can't see
what finger I'm hoIding up.

567
00:40:43,491 --> 00:40:45,686
-Wine?
-PIease.

568
00:40:55,437 --> 00:40:57,632
-SpiIIed some.
-I got it.

569
00:41:09,451 --> 00:41:11,646
I must say,
you Iook beautifuI tonight.

570
00:41:11,686 --> 00:41:13,551
What?

571
00:41:14,656 --> 00:41:16,453
Sorry.

572
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,560
You Iook beautifuI.

573
00:41:36,678 --> 00:41:39,613
Okay. You know what? That's it.

574
00:41:47,622 --> 00:41:48,714
Oh, yes.

575
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:52,422
Good.

576
00:41:57,465 --> 00:41:58,557
You guys, did you--?

577
00:42:08,543 --> 00:42:10,568
Monica, wake up.

578
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:14,648
-What's up?
-I thought of a thing.

579
00:42:19,487 --> 00:42:21,546
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

580
00:42:21,689 --> 00:42:26,558
I have to sIeep, have to,
on this side of the bed.

581
00:42:27,695 --> 00:42:31,461
No. You have to sIeep
on this side of the bed...

582
00:42:31,566 --> 00:42:35,502
...because I have to sIeep
on this side of the bed.

583
00:42:35,703 --> 00:42:39,571
Or so I wouId have you beIieve.

584
00:42:41,676 --> 00:42:45,703
So you have a side of the bed.
Everybody has a side of the bed.

585
00:42:46,481 --> 00:42:48,676
Come on. You haven't
heard my reason yet.

586
00:42:49,517 --> 00:42:52,486
-AII right, go on.
-Okay.

587
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,715
I have to sIeep on the west side...

588
00:42:55,490 --> 00:43:00,484
...because I grew up in CaIifornia,
and otherwise...

589
00:43:00,595 --> 00:43:03,689
...the ocean wouId be
on the wrong side.

590
00:43:08,536 --> 00:43:09,628
Oh, my God.

591
00:43:09,737 --> 00:43:12,706
-You're a freak!
-Yeah.

592
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,708
How about that?

593
00:43:18,713 --> 00:43:21,739
-Where are you shipping off to?
-I can't say.

594
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:26,510
-Do you have nucIear weapons onboard?
-I can't say.

595
00:43:26,621 --> 00:43:29,522
Do you get to Iook
through a periscope?

596
00:43:29,624 --> 00:43:31,558
I'm sorry, but I can't say.

597
00:43:31,626 --> 00:43:34,618
Wow, it's neat Iearning
about submarines.

598
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:38,522
-I better get out of here.
-I'II waIk you out.

599
00:43:38,566 --> 00:43:41,660
-Bye, Ryan.
-A pIeasure. Take care.

600
00:43:46,641 --> 00:43:51,601
So do you think we couId get you
one of those uniform things?

601
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,472
-You Iike that, do you?
-Oh, yeah.

602
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:58,575
-I'II make some caIIs.
-Okay.

603
00:43:59,487 --> 00:44:03,685
-Can you beIieve how we spent our time?
-We didn't do anything I pIanned...

604
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:08,628
...Iike having a picnic in CentraI Park
and coffee at CentraI Perk.

605
00:44:08,696 --> 00:44:11,494
Oh, I just got that!

606
00:44:19,707 --> 00:44:21,504
Taxi!

607
00:44:27,515 --> 00:44:28,641
Bye, you.

608
00:44:41,729 --> 00:44:43,526
I'm sorry, we're cIo--

609
00:44:46,634 --> 00:44:49,569
-Hey, saiIor.
-Is this what you had in mind?

610
00:44:51,506 --> 00:44:52,666
I'II say.

611
00:44:58,513 --> 00:45:00,572
I'm shipping out tomorrow.

612
00:45:00,682 --> 00:45:02,479
WeII, then...

613
00:45:04,485 --> 00:45:06,715
...we better make this night count.

614
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:11,683
Wait, I forgot to turn off
the cappuccino machine.

615
00:45:20,501 --> 00:45:22,526
Anchors aweigh.

616
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:26,638
Oh, wait, wait!
My purse, my purse!

617
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:35,514
Oh, I forgot to turn off the Iight.

618
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:38,542
Why don't I just meet you upstairs?

619
00:45:42,624 --> 00:45:44,558
Honey!

620
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:51,743
-How was the audition?
-IncredibIe.

621
00:45:51,848 --> 00:45:53,975
You won't beIieve
who the director was.

622
00:45:54,784 --> 00:45:57,776
-Who?
-I'II give you one hint:

623
00:45:57,854 --> 00:45:59,879
Warren Beatty.

624
00:45:59,956 --> 00:46:00,945
Wow.

625
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:04,750
There's just one thing
that might be a probIem.

626
00:46:04,861 --> 00:46:06,988
See, I had to kiss this guy.

627
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:09,994
Because he was just so darn cute?

628
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:12,894
No, I'm up for the part of this guy...

629
00:46:12,969 --> 00:46:14,903
...who the main guy kisses.

630
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:19,874
WeII, you're an actor. I say
you just suck it up and you do it.

631
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,077
Or you just do it.

632
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:27,975
I did do it. I'm a professionaI.

633
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:30,987
My first girIfriend
was Lisa DiBatista...

634
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:33,990
...so I'm no stranger
to the mustache.

635
00:46:34,891 --> 00:46:35,915
What's the probIem?

636
00:46:35,992 --> 00:46:41,020
After the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up
and says, ''Good actor. Bad kisser.''

637
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:44,824
Can you beIieve that?
Me, not a good kisser.

638
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:46,027
That's Iike...

639
00:46:46,836 --> 00:46:48,963
...Mother Teresa, not a good mother.

640
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,831
Who cares what that guy thinks?

641
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:55,936
What does Warren Beatty
know about kissing?

642
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,941
The One With Barry and Mindy's Wedding

643
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:51,757
-What did your agent say?
-The kiss is definiteIy a probIem.

644
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:56,931
Mr. Beatty wants to see it again.
I gotta find out what I'm doing wrong.

645
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,941
One of you girIs
come over here and kiss me.

646
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:02,845
-Forget it.
-Yeah, right.

647
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:04,870
Come on.
I need your heIp here.

648
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:08,850
I'II do it. I've kissed him before.
I can do it again.

649
00:48:08,952 --> 00:48:10,886
See this? This is a friend.

650
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:12,945
Let's go.

651
00:48:12,989 --> 00:48:15,787
Oh, wait. I have gum.

652
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:17,885
Okay.

653
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:28,870
Good. Very good. Firm, but tender.

654
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:30,964
I'd recommend you to a friend.

655
00:48:32,008 --> 00:48:36,911
-I don't know what the probIem is.
-Maybe you're not used to kissing men.

656
00:48:37,013 --> 00:48:40,915
Maybe you just tensed up.
Maybe you need to work on that.

657
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:43,878
Yeah, that makes sense.

658
00:48:48,758 --> 00:48:49,918
Over my dead body.

659
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,956
And I'II be using
his dead body as a shieId.

660
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:03,968
Come on out.
I'm teIIing you, you Iook good.

661
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:07,835
TeII her she Iooks good.
TeII her she Iooks good.

662
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:14,883
Oh, my God!

663
00:49:16,886 --> 00:49:18,979
You Iook so good!

664
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:24,783
I cannot beIieve I have to waIk
in front of 200 peopIe...

665
00:49:24,894 --> 00:49:28,853
...Iooking Iike something
you drink when you're nauseous.

666
00:49:28,898 --> 00:49:31,867
So don't.
I don't see why we have to go.

667
00:49:31,901 --> 00:49:36,861
-It's your ex-fiancé's wedding.
-Because I promised Mindy I wouId.

668
00:49:36,906 --> 00:49:39,966
Yeah, weII, you promised Barry
you'd marry him.

669
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:44,002
You guys, I have to go.
I'm the maid of honor.

670
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:47,909
Besides, I need to be in a room
again with these peopIe...

671
00:49:48,718 --> 00:49:50,743
...and feeI good about myseIf.

672
00:49:58,928 --> 00:50:02,864
You have the same cIothes on
as Iast night. Get some action?

673
00:50:02,932 --> 00:50:03,921
I may have.

674
00:50:04,934 --> 00:50:05,866
Stud!

675
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:09,837
-What's she Iook Iike?
-We haven't met.

676
00:50:09,873 --> 00:50:12,842
We just stayed up taIking
on the Internet.

677
00:50:13,743 --> 00:50:14,732
Geek!

678
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:18,771
I Iike this girI.
I seriousIy Iike this girI.

679
00:50:18,848 --> 00:50:21,976
Know how I tend to get
a IittIe defended and quippy?

680
00:50:22,752 --> 00:50:24,845
-Get out!
-No! PIease.

681
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:29,757
WeII, she caIIed me on it, okay?
She said, ''Cut it out, get reaI.''

682
00:50:29,959 --> 00:50:30,983
And I did.

683
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:32,887
Wow.

684
00:50:32,962 --> 00:50:34,896
What's that Iike?

685
00:50:36,766 --> 00:50:38,859
It's Iike this. Me.

686
00:50:38,968 --> 00:50:40,799
No jokes.

687
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:43,768
Stop it.
You're freaking me out.

688
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:46,842
I don't Iike you this way.

689
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:49,711
I'II see you guys Iater.

690
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:50,940
-Bye, Richard.
-Bye-bye.

691
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:55,717
-Bye, sweetie. I Iove you.
-I Iove you too.

692
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:05,727
I think my boyfriend's
ever so dreamy.

693
00:51:06,729 --> 00:51:08,856
I wonder what our wedding
wiII be Iike.

694
00:51:10,733 --> 00:51:14,829
-What do you mean? What wedding?
-You never taIk about that?

695
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:18,965
No, never.
We're just Iiving in the moment.

696
00:51:19,742 --> 00:51:23,769
It's nice for once not to get hung up
on, ''Where is this going?''

697
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:26,975
-Afraid to ask him?
-CouId not be more terrified.

698
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,877
You shouId seriousIy
consider marriage.

699
00:51:29,986 --> 00:51:34,753
Give RacheI another chance to dress
Iike Princess BubbIe Yum.

700
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:42,958
I was Iaughing at this quip
Leno made Iast night.

701
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:46,935
I wasn't Iaughing at your dress.
I Iove you.

702
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:52,834
Where's Benny?

703
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:54,809
There he is!

704
00:51:54,844 --> 00:51:55,936
Where's Benny?

705
00:51:56,713 --> 00:51:57,907
There he is!

706
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:05,811
Babies probabIy Iearn to taIk
so they can teII grownups to cut it out.

707
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:09,817
Hey, I got a question for you.

708
00:52:09,859 --> 00:52:13,022
-Just a IittIe thing, no pressure.
-Okay.

709
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:18,723
Do you ever think about the future?

710
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:21,961
-Sure, I do.
-Yeah? Am I in it?

711
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:24,729
Honey...

712
00:52:24,874 --> 00:52:25,863
...you are it.

713
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:29,969
Oh, God.
You're about to get so Iucky.

714
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:31,941
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

715
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:37,947
-Keep taIking.
-WeII....

716
00:52:37,987 --> 00:52:40,956
Sometimes I think about
seIIing my practice.

717
00:52:41,991 --> 00:52:44,960
We couId move to France.

718
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:46,888
Make French toast.

719
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:49,822
Okay, so...

720
00:52:50,733 --> 00:52:51,927
...we're in France...

721
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:54,995
...and we're making the toast.

722
00:52:56,739 --> 00:52:59,902
Do you see a IittIe bassinet
in the corner?

723
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:01,843
Like a hound?

724
00:53:03,846 --> 00:53:05,746
Not a basset.

725
00:53:05,915 --> 00:53:07,712
A bassinet.

726
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:11,846
You reaIIy need the bassinet?

727
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:16,016
WeII, I just think the baby
wouId keep faIIing off the dog.

728
00:53:17,927 --> 00:53:21,761
Do you not see kids in our future?

729
00:53:22,932 --> 00:53:24,763
I Iove chiIdren.

730
00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:26,765
I have chiIdren.

731
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:30,736
I don't wanna be 70
when our kids go to coIIege...

732
00:53:30,773 --> 00:53:32,968
...and our Iife can finaIIy start.

733
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:38,940
I want you...

734
00:53:39,782 --> 00:53:40,840
...now.

735
00:53:41,951 --> 00:53:43,782
WeII, that's great.

736
00:53:43,953 --> 00:53:46,717
We don't need to taIk about this now.

737
00:53:46,789 --> 00:53:49,883
This is so, Iike,
way, way in the future.

738
00:53:50,693 --> 00:53:53,890
I'm taIking hovercrafts
and apes taking over the pIanet.

739
00:53:58,701 --> 00:54:01,693
Come on, ChandIer.
I want this part so much.

740
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:04,805
Just one kiss.
I won't teII anyone.

741
00:54:04,907 --> 00:54:07,705
Joey, no means no.

742
00:54:08,945 --> 00:54:10,810
Hey.

743
00:54:12,715 --> 00:54:15,741
I'm sorry,
we don't have your sheep.

744
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:20,916
I think you Iook cute.

745
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:24,827
-Thank you.
-And you. You....

746
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:29,730
-You, I couId eat.
-Get away from me. I said no.

747
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:33,733
Richard's downstairs.

748
00:54:33,836 --> 00:54:36,964
Richard's here?
I shouId run down and say goodbye.

749
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,768
-Bye.
-Good Iuck.

750
00:54:44,847 --> 00:54:47,941
How's your date with cyber-chick?
Hey, what is aII that?

751
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:51,720
It's a website.
It's the Guggenheim Museum.

752
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:53,880
See, she Iikes art...

753
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,816
...and I Iike funny words.

754
00:54:57,927 --> 00:55:00,794
What does she mean by ''HH''?

755
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:03,798
It means we're hoIding hands.

756
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:06,698
Are you the cutest?

757
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,794
I'm afraid I might just be.

758
00:55:11,707 --> 00:55:14,835
I think it's so great
that you're into this person...

759
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:19,905
...yet for aII you know, she couId be
90 years oId or have two heads.

760
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,808
It couId be a guy.

761
00:55:23,753 --> 00:55:26,745
It's not a guy, aII right?
I know her.

762
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:29,758
It couId be Iike a big, giant guy.

763
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:36,730
Man, I got this cIose to him,
and Monica kneed me in the back.

764
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:38,728
What's going on?

765
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:41,760
We're wondering
if his girIfriend's a girI.

766
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:45,740
Ask how Iong she's gonna Iive.
Women Iive Ionger than men.

767
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:52,839
How do you not faII down more?

768
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:56,877
Okay. Ask her what is her method
of birth controI.

769
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:58,853
AII right.

770
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:05,792
''My husband is sIeeping
with his secretary.''

771
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:07,863
She's married?

772
00:56:08,764 --> 00:56:10,755
At Ieast we know she's a woman.

773
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:16,896
-I can't beIieve she's married.
-Oh, man, I'm sorry.

774
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:21,775
This must be reaIIy tough for you.

775
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:29,883
I read this articIe that says
you shouIdn't throw rice at weddings.

776
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:32,888
When pigeons eat rice, it kiIIs them.

777
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:36,790
So that's why you never see
pigeons in sushi bars.

778
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:40,886
-See, we're having fun.
-Oh, absoIuteIy.

779
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:44,898
I'm not thinking about that thing
we won't think about.

780
00:56:45,001 --> 00:56:46,832
Neither am I.

781
00:56:46,969 --> 00:56:49,733
Hey, there.
Are you aII right?

782
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:53,741
Yeah. But I saw the window
I crawIed out of at my wedding.

783
00:56:53,776 --> 00:56:57,769
And I just started thinking
I shouIdn't be here. I shouIdn't.

784
00:56:57,847 --> 00:57:01,943
PeopIe wiII Iook at me and judge me
and think about the Iast time.

785
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:06,886
It's gonna be okay. It's a wedding.
PeopIe focus on the bride.

786
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:08,949
I know, you're right.

787
00:57:08,991 --> 00:57:11,789
AIrighty.
Everybody Iook at me. Good.

788
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:13,988
It's time. Bridesmaids and ushers...

789
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,857
...Iet's see two Iines.
Thank you.

790
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,868
I'II see you after the thing.

791
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:21,766
-Good Iuck.
-Thank you.

792
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:22,895
-Okay.
-Okay.

793
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:24,872
Okay.

794
00:57:36,819 --> 00:57:39,788
-Why didn't you teII me?
-What couId I do?

795
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:45,794
-Shout, ''Hey, your butt is showing!''
-Yeah! Better you than Barry's uncIe!

796
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:47,760
This is so humiIiating.

797
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:50,765
The onIy thing worse
was in eighth grade...

798
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:54,826
...when I had to sing the ''Copacabana''
to the entire schooI.

799
00:57:54,937 --> 00:57:59,738
Two Iines into it, I freaked out.
My Iife's fIashing before my eyes.

800
00:57:59,842 --> 00:58:02,834
Rach, Iook, I remember that.
It wasn't so bad.

801
00:58:02,878 --> 00:58:06,939
Ross, wouId you stop!
You got me. I'm dating you.

802
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:10,878
-RacheI.
-Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Weinberg.

803
00:58:10,953 --> 00:58:13,854
It's wonderfuI
to see you again, my dear.

804
00:58:13,889 --> 00:58:17,052
In fact, I hardIy expected
to see so much.

805
00:58:18,961 --> 00:58:23,762
-You toId me you didn't see anything.
-I teII you a Iot of things.

806
00:58:23,866 --> 00:58:26,994
It's wonderfuI to have you
up and about again, dear.

807
00:58:27,903 --> 00:58:29,768
Stay weII.

808
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:34,971
That's the third time someone has
said something Iike that to me today.

809
00:58:35,878 --> 00:58:36,902
Rach!

810
00:58:36,979 --> 00:58:39,880
-Oh, my God, I'm married!
-I know!

811
00:58:39,982 --> 00:58:43,782
I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter-Farber.

812
00:58:43,886 --> 00:58:45,820
I am so proud of you, Min.

813
00:58:45,921 --> 00:58:47,821
Min.

814
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,722
Rach. StiII here.

815
00:58:49,825 --> 00:58:53,727
At our wedding, they'd packed up
the chopped Iiver by now.

816
00:58:53,829 --> 00:58:55,922
Oh, yeah, I Iove that story.

817
00:58:56,832 --> 00:58:57,958
I have a question.

818
00:58:58,768 --> 00:59:01,931
Why are peopIe saying
it's good to see me up and about?

819
00:59:02,738 --> 00:59:04,831
After you ran out on your wedding...

820
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:07,966
...Barry's parents toId peopIe
you were sort of...

821
00:59:08,744 --> 00:59:09,768
...insane.

822
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:11,747
Insane?

823
00:59:11,947 --> 00:59:13,744
From the syphiIis.

824
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:14,941
What?

825
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:19,944
What were they gonna say?
You didn't Iove me anymore?

826
00:59:20,756 --> 00:59:24,749
Your choices were that or syphiIis?

827
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:29,058
Sweetie, at Ieast this puts your whoIe
tushy show into perspective.

828
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,058
AngeIa?

829
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:33,860
Joey Tribbiani.

830
00:59:34,804 --> 00:59:37,864
Listen, what are you doing tonight?

831
00:59:37,973 --> 00:59:41,909
I know you're seeing that guy.
Maybe you couId bring him....

832
00:59:41,977 --> 00:59:44,002
HeIIo? HeIIo?

833
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:58,750
WiII you answer? That's the 10th
bing-bong message she's sent.

834
00:59:58,828 --> 01:00:01,956
-She asks what's wrong.
-What's wrong? You're married!

835
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:04,723
That's what's wrong!

836
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:07,960
-Oh, my.
-What?

837
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:09,932
She wants to meet you.

838
01:00:09,972 --> 01:00:12,873
Look, Phoebe,
I wanted to meet her too.

839
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:15,740
But she's married.
She has a husband.

840
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:18,939
What if he's the wrong guy
and you are the right guy?

841
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:21,942
You don't get these chances often.

842
01:00:21,984 --> 01:00:25,784
Meet her or you'II kick yourseIf
when you're 80...

843
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:28,847
...which is hard to do
and you'II break a hip.

844
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:32,785
I don't know.

845
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:36,898
Listen. Those are the bing-bongs
of a woman in Iove with you.

846
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:40,968
Okay. I'II do it.

847
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:45,969
Okay, great! Put on your shoes
and then march out there and meet her.

848
01:00:46,008 --> 01:00:48,943
No, wait! You have
to take a shower because:

849
01:00:49,712 --> 01:00:50,804
And I'II get the--

850
01:00:50,913 --> 01:00:53,905
No, you have to answer her.
Answer her first.

851
01:00:53,949 --> 01:00:57,715
No, make some coffee
because it's too much.

852
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:04,850
Okay, one more, pIease.
I'II get it in this time.

853
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,860
Okay, Iast chance.

854
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,735
Again, I'm sorry.

855
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,969
You know what?
Maybe I don't need to have chiIdren.

856
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:25,942
Maybe I just think I do
because that's what society...

857
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:28,842
...and by that, I mean my mom...

858
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:31,945
...has aIways convinced me that I--

859
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:37,783
I do.

860
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,852
I have to have chiIdren.
I'm sorry, I just do.

861
01:01:43,799 --> 01:01:45,790
Can I have your attention?

862
01:01:45,901 --> 01:01:47,892
Best man making a toast here.

863
01:01:47,937 --> 01:01:49,802
Thank you.

864
01:01:50,806 --> 01:01:54,902
I remember when Barry got home
from his first date with RacheI.

865
01:01:57,713 --> 01:02:01,809
What? You hired the same band.
I can't use the same speech?

866
01:02:01,917 --> 01:02:04,818
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

867
01:02:04,854 --> 01:02:06,913
Anyway, I wish you both...

868
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:08,947
...a wonderfuI Iife together.

869
01:02:09,825 --> 01:02:10,814
And RacheI....

870
01:02:11,727 --> 01:02:13,922
-What?
-No, no, in aII seriousness.

871
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:17,722
Not many women wouId
have the guts to be here.

872
01:02:17,766 --> 01:02:21,759
And even fewer who'd do it
with their asses hanging out.

873
01:02:28,744 --> 01:02:30,871
I'd Iike to add something to that.

874
01:02:30,946 --> 01:02:33,779
-Why are you adding?
-It's okay.

875
01:02:34,850 --> 01:02:37,978
Most of you don't know me.
I'm RacheI's boyfriend.

876
01:02:38,787 --> 01:02:39,947
Oh, dear God.

877
01:02:40,856 --> 01:02:41,948
Ross.

878
01:02:42,057 --> 01:02:43,957
And I'd just Iike to say...

879
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:48,992
...that it did take a Iot of courage
for RacheI to come here tonight.

880
01:02:49,732 --> 01:02:51,757
And just for the record...

881
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:56,703
...she did not run out on Barry
because she had syphiIis.

882
01:02:58,007 --> 01:02:59,702
I'm serious.

883
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:06,747
The reason she waIked out
on Barry is simpIy...

884
01:03:06,815 --> 01:03:08,783
...that she didn't Iove him.

885
01:03:08,851 --> 01:03:12,753
Which, incidentaIIy,
worked out pretty weII for me.

886
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:20,929
So, to review:

887
01:03:23,832 --> 01:03:24,958
RacheI...

888
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:27,736
...took a Iot of courage...

889
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:30,963
...doesn't have the syphiIis...

890
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:35,733
...and wound up with me.

891
01:03:36,045 --> 01:03:37,774
Cheers.

892
01:03:38,847 --> 01:03:41,873
-See you in the parking Iot.
-No, Rach--

893
01:03:43,953 --> 01:03:48,720
And once again, she is out of here!
Okay, who had 9:45?

894
01:04:02,805 --> 01:04:05,706
You know what, Bar?
I'm not gonna Ieave.

895
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:08,809
I probabIy shouId, but I'm not.

896
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:14,713
I promised myseIf I'd make it
through at Ieast one of your weddings.

897
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:21,722
AII I wanted was
to make it through this evening...

898
01:04:21,824 --> 01:04:25,817
...with a IittIe bit of grace
and dignity.

899
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:29,964
WeII, I guess we can aII agree
that's not gonna happen.

900
01:04:33,836 --> 01:04:36,828
I guess there's nothing
reaIIy Ieft to say...

901
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:38,934
...except:

902
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:04,788
Thank you, honey.

903
01:05:12,808 --> 01:05:15,003
-Wait, wait! Everybody!
-Everybody!

904
01:05:37,933 --> 01:05:40,959
Okay. I'II do it.

905
01:05:41,870 --> 01:05:42,837
You'II do what?

906
01:05:42,938 --> 01:05:46,840
If it takes kids to be with you,
then kids it is.

907
01:05:46,942 --> 01:05:47,966
Oh, my God.

908
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:53,747
If I have to, I'II do it aII again.
I'II do the 4:00 feeding thing.

909
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:57,842
I'II go to the PTA meetings.
I'II coach the soccer team.

910
01:05:58,854 --> 01:06:00,947
-ReaIIy?
-Yeah, if I have to.

911
01:06:02,758 --> 01:06:03,850
Monica...

912
01:06:05,994 --> 01:06:08,758
...I don't wanna Iose you.

913
01:06:08,897 --> 01:06:11,889
So if I have to do it aII again...

914
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,865
...then I wiII.

915
01:06:16,872 --> 01:06:19,773
You are the most wonderfuI man.

916
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:23,768
And if you hadn't said...

917
01:06:23,812 --> 01:06:27,009
...''If I have to,'' Iike, 1 7 times...

918
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:31,082
...then I'd be saying,
''Okay, Iet's do it.''

919
01:06:32,988 --> 01:06:34,785
But you're not.

920
01:06:36,992 --> 01:06:41,895
Oh, my God. I can't beIieve
what I'm getting ready to say.

921
01:06:45,934 --> 01:06:47,925
I wanna have a baby.

922
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:55,933
But I don't want to have one with
someone who doesn't reaIIy want one.

923
01:06:57,946 --> 01:06:59,777
God....

924
01:07:04,953 --> 01:07:06,784
I Iove you.

925
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:12,988
I know you do.

926
01:07:15,898 --> 01:07:17,763
Me too.

927
01:07:24,773 --> 01:07:26,001
So what now?

928
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:30,001
I guess we just...

929
01:07:30,979 --> 01:07:32,879
...keep dancing.

930
01:07:47,763 --> 01:07:48,957
Where is she?
Where is she?

931
01:07:49,731 --> 01:07:52,723
Oh, hey, I have a question.
Where is she?

932
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:55,828
ReIax, ChandIer.
She'II be here.

933
01:07:58,841 --> 01:07:59,830
Oh, that's her.

934
01:07:59,975 --> 01:08:03,741
Yeah, because Iife's just that kind.

935
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:05,947
Stop staring at the door.

936
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:07,879
It's Iike a watched pot.

937
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:11,943
If you keep Iooking at it,
the door's never gonna boiI.

938
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:14,979
I think what you have to do
is try not to--

939
01:08:20,896 --> 01:08:22,796
Oh, my God.

940
01:08:25,767 --> 01:08:26,791
Oh...

941
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:28,799
...my...

942
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:30,768
...God.

943
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:40,873
Oh...

944
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:41,972
...my...

945
01:08:42,084 --> 01:08:43,779
...God.

946
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:52,916
AII right.

947
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:56,855
I've feIt guiIty because
I wanna be a good friend.

948
01:08:56,932 --> 01:09:01,028
And damn it, I am a good friend.
So shut up and cIose your eyes.

949
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:05,933
Wow.

950
01:09:06,975 --> 01:09:08,966
You are a good friend.

951
01:09:09,745 --> 01:09:12,873
Of course, the audition's over,
and I didn't get it.

952
01:09:13,949 --> 01:09:15,974
But that was a heII of a kiss.

953
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:18,982
RacheI is a very Iucky girI.
