1
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:09,366
Hey, gorgeous! How's it going?

2
00:00:09,442 --> 00:00:13,242
Dehydrated Japanese noodIes
under fIuorescent Iights.

3
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,280
Does it get better than this?

4
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:17,539
Question: Are you dating anyone?

5
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:21,286
I met somebody who wouId be
perfect for you.

6
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:23,445
Perfect might be a probIem.

7
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:27,385
Had you said codependent
or seIf-destructive....

8
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:31,262
-You want a date Saturday?
-Yes, pIease.

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,457
He is cute.

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,264
-He's funny. He's--
-He's a he?

11
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,461
WeII, yeah.

12
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:40,398
Oh, God! I just--

13
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:42,568
You're nice-- Oh, God.

14
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:47,278
Good, SheIIy. I'm gonna fIush myseIf
down the toiIet now.

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,369
Okay. Bye-bye.

16
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:52,474
The One Where Nana Dies Twice

17
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:41,500
It's hard to enjoy noodIes
after that. Is that ridicuIous?

18
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:45,271
Can you beIieve she actuaIIy
thought that?

19
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,269
Yeah.

20
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,403
When I first met you,
I thought maybe...

21
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,275
...possibIy...

22
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,372
...you might be.

23
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:57,371
You did?

24
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:01,215
You spent Phoebe's birthday
party taIking to my breasts...

25
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,255
...so I figured maybe not.

26
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:09,361
Did any of the rest of you guys
think that when you first met me?

27
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:11,363
-I did.
-I think so, yeah.

28
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:15,425
-Not me.
-No, no, me neither.

29
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:19,429
AIthough back in coIIege,
Susan SaIadore did.

30
00:02:20,273 --> 00:02:21,365
You're kidding.

31
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,233
-Did you teII her I wasn't?
-No.

32
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,246
I wanted to go out with her too.

33
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:31,375
I toId her you were seeing
Bernie SpeIIman...

34
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,346
...who aIso Iiked her.

35
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:42,361
WeII, this is fascinating.

36
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,490
So what is it about me?

37
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:48,457
I don't know.
You're smart, you're funny....

38
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,362
So is Ross.
Ever think that about him?

39
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,371
-Yeah, right!
-What is it?

40
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:59,401
I don't know. You just--
You have a quaIity.

41
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,310
-Yes, exactIy.
-Yeah, a quaIity.

42
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:07,209
''A quaIity.'' Good. I was worried you
were gonna be vague about this.

43
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,448
I think this is gonna work for you.

44
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,249
-Excuse me?
-Sure, sure.

45
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:18,320
Women find you Iess threatening,
they Iet their guards down...

46
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,458
...you're Iike a steaIth heterosexuaI.

47
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:37,382
-It's PaoIo caIIing from Rome.
-Oh, my God! CaIIing from Rome!

48
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:45,447
So he's caIIing from Rome.
I couId do that.

49
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,452
Just gotta go to Rome.

50
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:53,355
Your Dad just beeped in.
Can you make it quick?

51
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,297
I'm taIking to Rome.

52
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,463
I'm taIking to Rome.

53
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,233
Hey, Dad. What's up?

54
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,332
Oh, God.

55
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,337
Ross, it's Nana.

56
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:20,224
-How you doing?
-Hey, Dad.

57
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:24,453
So how is she doing?

58
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,229
The doctor says
it's a matter of hours.

59
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,335
-How are you, Mom?
-Me? I'm fine, fine.

60
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,428
I'm gIad you're here.

61
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:38,242
-What's with your hair?
-What?

62
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,469
-What's different?
-Nothing.

63
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,372
Oh, maybe that's it.

64
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,342
-She's unbeIievabIe. Her mother's--
-Okay, reIax.

65
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,478
We're gonna be here a whiIe.

66
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,350
We stiII have boyfriends
and your career to cover.

67
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,451
Oh, God!

68
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:05,202
The fuzzy IittIe mints
at the bottom of her purse.

69
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,497
Yeah, they were gross.

70
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,409
You know what I Iove?

71
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:12,411
Her Sweet 'N Lows.

72
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:16,211
How she was aIways steaIing them
from restaurants.

73
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,308
Not just from restaurants,
from our house.

74
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:21,220
Mrs. GeIIer?

75
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,256
She Iooks so smaII.

76
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,417
I know.

77
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,264
WeII, at Ieast she's with Pop-Pop
and Aunt PhyIis now.

78
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,268
Aunt PhyIis is dead?

79
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,361
Yeah, for Iike six years.

80
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:43,340
Where were--?
Can we focus, pIease?

81
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,344
Goodbye, Nana.

82
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,292
Bye, Nana.

83
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,326
Nurse!

84
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,297
What is going on?

85
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,435
You know how the nurse said
Nana had passed?

86
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:18,403
WeII, she's not quite.

87
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,245
What?

88
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:25,215
She's not passed!
She's present! She's back!

89
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,409
What's going on?

90
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,350
She may have died.

91
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,414
She may have died?

92
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,418
We're Iooking into it.

93
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,420
I'II go see.

94
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,365
This aImost never happens.

95
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,219
Now she's passed.

96
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,193
I just have to know, okay?

97
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:13,423
Is it my hair?

98
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,292
Yes, that's exactIy what it is.
It's your hair.

99
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,428
Yeah, you have homosexuaI hair.

100
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,209
So did she...?

101
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:30,211
Twice.

102
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:33,444
-Twice?
-Oh, that sucks.

103
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:39,248
-You guys okay?
-I don't know. It's weird.

104
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:42,521
I know she's gone,
but I just don't feeI....

105
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,263
Maybe she's not reaIIy gone.

106
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,525
No, no, she's gone.

107
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,264
We checked.

108
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,426
A Iot.

109
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,468
No, I mean, maybe no one
ever reaIIy goes.

110
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:58,243
Ever since my mom died,
every now and then...

111
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:02,178
...I get this feeIing that she's
right here, you know?

112
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,312
And Debbie, my friend
from junior high...

113
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:12,221
...got struck by Iightning
on a miniature goIf course.

114
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,385
I aIways get this strong
Debbie vibe...

115
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,288
...when I use a IittIe yeIIow penciI.

116
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:26,394
-I miss her.
-Here, Pheebs.

117
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,195
Want this?

118
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,298
-Oh, thanks.
-Sure.

119
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,402
I just sharpened her this morning.

120
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:38,206
I don't beIieve any of that.
When you're dead...

121
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:41,343
...you're dead. You're gone.
You're worm food.

122
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,226
So ChandIer Iooks gay, huh?

123
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:54,233
I don't know who this is,
but it's not Debbie.

124
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,175
Dad, Iet's just make a decision.

125
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:06,211
You're right.
It's going into the ground.

126
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,180
We shouId get the most basic thing.

127
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:14,209
''The non-protective corrugated
fiberboard with white Iaminate.''

128
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:18,187
Dad, we can't bury Nana
in a dresser from Ikea.

129
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,383
This is why your mother
buys my cIothes.

130
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:24,419
I hate to shop. I hate it.

131
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:27,392
Isn't this more about
the fact that...

132
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:32,302
...once you decide, it's Iike
acknowIedging Nana's actuaIIy gone?

133
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:35,433
No, I reaIIy hate to shop.

134
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:47,215
-I thought it'd be a cIosed casket.
-It doesn't mean she can't Iook nice.

135
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,419
Sweetie, you think
you can get in there?

136
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,421
I don't see why not.

137
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:17,442
Here's my retainer.

138
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,359
I was just thinking...

139
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,395
-...when my time comes--
-Dad.

140
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:32,259
Listen to me.

141
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:37,402
When my time comes,
I wanna be buried at sea.

142
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,295
You what?

143
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:45,300
I wanna be buried at sea.
It Iooks Iike fun.

144
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:48,505
Define ''fun.''

145
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:53,274
Come on. You'II make a day of it.
You'II get a boat, pack a Iunch....

146
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:57,480
And then we throw your body in
the water. Gee, that does sound fun.

147
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,454
Everyone thinks they know me.
Everyone says I'm so predictabIe.

148
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:07,461
Maybe after I'm gone, they'II say,
''Buried at sea? Huh?''

149
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,329
That's probabIy what they'II say.

150
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:15,337
I'd Iike that.

151
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,446
-Hey, gorgeous.
-Hey.

152
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:32,457
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.

153
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:37,291
Don't worry. ApparentIy, other peopIe
have made the same mistake.

154
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,298
Okay. Phew!

155
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,464
So, what do you think it is about me?

156
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,268
I don't know what.

157
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,275
You just have...

158
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,367
-...a quaIity.
-A quaIity. Great.

159
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:56,380
It's a shame. You and LoweII
wouId've made a great coupIe.

160
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:02,310
LoweII? FinanciaI Services LoweII?
That's who you saw me with?

161
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,410
What? He's cute.

162
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,315
WeII, yeah.

163
00:12:05,424 --> 00:12:07,415
He's no Brian in PayroII.

164
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:11,418
Is Brian--?

165
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,223
I don't know. If you
were gonna set me up...

166
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,360
...I'd Iike to think it'd be
with somebody Iike him.

167
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:21,338
Brian's a IittIe out of your Ieague.

168
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:30,338
Excuse me. You don't think
I couId get a Brian?

169
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:36,378
Because I couId get a Brian.
BeIieve you me.

170
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:39,449
I'm reaIIy not.

171
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,351
This one?

172
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:49,263
I've shown you every dress we have.

173
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:53,395
UnIess you want her to spend eternity
in a Iemon-yeIIow pantsuit...

174
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,497
...go with the burgundy.

175
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:59,502
Whatever we pick, she'd say
it's the wrong one.

176
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:02,237
Right. We'II go with the burgundy.

177
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:05,249
A fine choice. I'm coming out.

178
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,216
Wait! We need shoes.

179
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:19,227
-How about these?
-That's reaIIy a day shoe.

180
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:22,323
Where she's going
everyone eIse wiII be dressier?

181
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:26,336
CouId we see something
in a sIimmer heeI?

182
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:35,270
I have nothing in an evening shoe
in the burgundy.

183
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:39,240
I can show you something
siIver that may work.

184
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:44,450
-No, it reaIIy shouId be burgundy.
-UnIess we go with a different dress.

185
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:46,554
No, no, no. Watch this.

186
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:50,353
Wait, I may have something
in the back.

187
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,300
Oh, my God.

188
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,405
Is everything aII right?

189
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,407
Just Nana's stuff.

190
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,265
You guys ready?

191
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,338
Mom caIIed to teII me
not to wear my hair up.

192
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:38,342
-IKnow my ears aren't my best feature?
-Some days it's aII I can think about.

193
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,338
I'm sorry I'm Iate.
I couIdn't find my bearings.

194
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,346
You mean your earrings?

195
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:46,246
What did I say?

196
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:51,450
-Are these the shoes?
-Yes. PaoIo sent them from ItaIy.

197
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,250
What? We don't have shoes here?

198
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:01,198
-Morning. We ready to go?
-Don't we Iook nice aII dressed up?

199
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,227
It's stuff Iike that, isn't it?

200
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:20,246
-It was a reaIIy beautifuI service.
-It reaIIy was.

201
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,414
Come here, sweetheart.

202
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:32,319
You know, I think it's time for you
to start using night cream.

203
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,369
What?

204
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:44,238
Nothing. Just that your coat
sounds Iike Brent Musberger.

205
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:50,279
-Check it out. Giants-Cowboys.
-You're watching footbaII at a funeraI?

206
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:54,284
No, it's the pre-game.
I'm gonna watch it at the reception.

207
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,380
You're a frightening, frightening man.

208
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,382
Oh, no! My new PaoIo shoes!

209
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:03,422
I hope they're not ruined.

210
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,232
God, what a great day!

211
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,194
What? Weather-wise.

212
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,432
I know.

213
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,435
The air, the trees.

214
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:23,338
Even though Nana's gone,
there's something aImost Iife--

215
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,351
Ross, are you okay?

216
00:16:27,453 --> 00:16:29,216
No, I'm fine.

217
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:31,448
Just...

218
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,418
...having my worst fear
reaIized, but....

219
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:45,528
I'm just checking to see
if the muscIe's in spasm.

220
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,274
-What? What is it?
-You missed a beIt Ioop.

221
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,369
Okay, it's in spasm.

222
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:59,440
Here, sweetie. I took these
when I had my gaII thing accident.

223
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,379
Thanks, Mom.

224
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:10,386
Sorry.

225
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,195
Hi, I'm Andrea.

226
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,300
I'm Dorothy's daughter.

227
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:19,235
Hi, I'm ChandIer, and I have
no idea who Dorothy is.

228
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:23,400
Look who's up!

229
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:29,213
-How do you feeI?
-I feeI great.

230
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,441
I feeI great. I feeI great.

231
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,344
Wow, those piIIs reaIIy worked.

232
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,423
Yeah. Not the first two,
but the second two....

233
00:17:43,328 --> 00:17:45,228
I Iove you guys.

234
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:50,232
You guys are the greatest.
I Iove my sister.

235
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,360
I Iove Pheebs.

236
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,430
That's so nice.

237
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:58,365
I Iove you, man.

238
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,271
And Iisten,
if you wanna be gay, be gay!

239
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:07,412
It doesn't matter to me.

240
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:10,377
You were right.

241
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,396
I do Iove you.

242
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,333
Oh, Ross. I Iove you too.

243
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,433
Oh, no, I reaIIy Iove you.

244
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:37,211
I reaIIy Iove you.

245
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,408
Oh, you don't get it!

246
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:51,424
-What do you got there?
-Just a hearing disabiIity.

247
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,256
What's the score?

248
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,360
1 7-1 4, Giants.
Three minutes to go in the third.

249
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,437
BeautifuI!

250
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,180
Pheebs, couId you maybe
hand me a cracker?

251
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,184
Your grandmother wouId've hated this.

252
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:20,391
Sure. What with it being
her funeraI and aII.

253
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:25,220
No, I'd be hearing about...

254
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,231
...why didn't I get
the honey-gIazed ham.

255
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:32,201
Or I didn't spend enough on fIowers.
Or she'd say:

256
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:35,398
''Why waste your money?
I don't need fIowers, I'm dead.''

257
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,241
That sounds Iike Nana.

258
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:42,244
Do you know what it's Iike
to grow up...

259
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:47,248
...with someone who is criticaI
of every singIe thing you say?

260
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,216
I can imagine.

261
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,259
It's a wonder your mother
turned out...

262
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:59,229
...to be the positive,
Iife-affirming person she is.

263
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,323
That is a wonder.

264
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:09,435
So teII me something, Mom.
If you had to do it aII over again...

265
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:13,234
...I mean, if she was here
right now...

266
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,278
...wouId you teII her?

267
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,347
TeII her what?

268
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:22,351
How she drove you crazy,
picking on every IittIe detaiI.

269
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,388
Like your hair, for exampIe.

270
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:29,259
I'm not sure I know
what you're getting at.

271
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:34,458
WouId things have been better
if you'd just toId her the truth?

272
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,366
Some things are better Ieft unsaid.

273
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:46,410
It's nicer when peopIe just get aIong.

274
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,473
More wine?

275
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:53,478
Oh, I think so.

276
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:04,427
Those earrings Iook
reaIIy IoveIy on you.

277
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,228
Thank you.

278
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:10,258
They're yours.

279
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,261
ActuaIIy, they were Nana's.

280
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,376
Now I'm depressed!

281
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,274
Even more than I was.

282
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,386
Oh, Iook. My first grade picture.

283
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,396
PIease ignore the Dy-no-mite T-shirt.

284
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:44,299
-Hey, who's this IittIe naked guy?
-That IittIe naked guy wouId be me.

285
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,401
Look at the IittIe thing!

286
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,276
Yes, fine.
That is my penis.

287
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:55,480
Can we be grownups now?

288
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:57,473
Who are those peopIe?

289
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:01,411
-Got me.
-That's Nana right there in the middIe.

290
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:03,445
Yeah, Iet's see.

291
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:06,451
''Me and the gang at Java Joe's.''

292
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:10,422
You Iook just Iike your grandmother.
How oId was she?

293
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,463
Let's see, ''1 939.''

294
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,230
Twenty-four, twenty-five.

295
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,269
It Iooks Iike a fun gang.

296
00:22:24,242 --> 00:22:27,268
Look, Iook, Iook!
I got Monica naked!

297
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,472
Let me see!

298
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:33,342
No, no. That wouId be me again.

299
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,382
I'm just trying something.

300
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:52,270
Hey, LoweII.

301
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:53,462
Oh, hey, ChandIer.

302
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:58,372
So how's it going in
FinanciaI Services?

303
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:02,208
It's Iike Mardi Gras without
the papier-mâché heads.

304
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:03,303
How about you?

305
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,316
Good. Good. Listen...

306
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:10,311
...I don't know what SheIIy toId you
about me, but...

307
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:13,220
...I'm not.

308
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,318
I know. That's what I toId her.

309
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:18,224
ReaIIy?

310
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,231
So you can teII?

311
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:27,262
Pretty much. Most of the time.
We have a kind of radar.

312
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:31,242
So you don't think I have...

313
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:32,367
...a quaIity?

314
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:36,476
Speaking for my peopIe,
I'd have to say no.

315
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:42,444
By the way, your friend Brian,
from PayroII? He is.

316
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:46,380
-He is?
-And way out of your Ieague.

317
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:51,454
Out of my Ieague!

318
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:56,365
I couId get a Brian. If I wanted to
get a Brian, I couId get a Brian.

319
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,368
Hey, Brian.
