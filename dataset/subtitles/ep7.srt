1
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:05,427
Okay, what is it about me?
Do I not Iook fun?

2
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:09,470
Is there something
repeIIent about me?

3
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:11,267
How was the party?

4
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:15,440
It couIdn't have been worse.
A woman IiteraIIy passed through me.

5
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:17,477
Am I hideousIy unattractive?

6
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:21,252
No, you are not.
You are very attractive.

7
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,254
I do the same thing.

8
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:27,453
When I put on a IittIe weight,
I question everything.

9
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:33,261
I've put on weight?

10
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,357
Did you want to...?

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,464
No, not weight.
More Iike insuIation.

12
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,310
I'm unempIoyed,
in need of a project.

13
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,505
Wanna work out?
I can remake you.

14
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:51,409
That might get in the way
of my Iying-around time.

15
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:55,277
-PIease?
-Come on, Iet her do it!

16
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,320
AII right.

17
00:00:56,423 --> 00:01:00,359
But if my boobs are bigger
than yours, I'm going home.

18
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:05,459
Your boobs are fine. I never
shouId have said anything. Come here.

19
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:11,461
Can't make hands meet!

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,431
The One Where Ross Finds Out

21
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,452
Let's do it!

22
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,423
What?

23
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:20,262
Just never seen your
IittIe stretchy pants before.

24
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,435
It's cute.

25
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,274
And we're changing.

26
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,451
Come on, give me five more!

27
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,462
Five more!

28
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:47,493
Five more and I'II fIash you.

29
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:49,360
One...

30
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,299
...two...

31
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,273
...two and a haIf.

32
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,501
Just show me one of them.

33
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:18,259
She's insane.
The woman's insane.

34
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:20,526
Before work, after work,
during work.

35
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:24,361
She's got me doing
butt-cIenches at my desk.

36
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:27,429
Now they won't
bring me my maiI anymore.

37
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,365
TeII her to stop.

38
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:32,467
No, whiIe she's unempIoyed
I'm aII she's got.

39
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:36,477
Why don't we aII pitch in
and buy her a restaurant?

40
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,452
How'd it go with Scott?

41
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:44,280
It was nice.
Went to a romantic restaurant...

42
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,348
...ordered champagne. Nice.

43
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,354
-He stiII won't put out?
-Nope. ZiIch. Nothing.

44
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,457
Sorry, Pheebs.

45
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,459
I don't mind taking it sIow.
I Iike him a Iot.

46
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,239
He's interesting,
and he's reaIIy sweet.

47
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,240
Why won't he give it up?

48
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:06,403
Maybe he drives on
the other side of the road.

49
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,210
If you know what I mean.

50
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,418
No. What do you mean?
He's not British.

51
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,321
Maybe he's gay.

52
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,450
I don't think that's it.

53
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:24,355
We went dancing
the other night...

54
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:28,332
...and the way he heId me
and Iooked into my eyes...

55
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:31,235
...I definiteIy feIt something.

56
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:33,430
How much can you teII
from a Iook?

57
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:36,465
No, I feIt it on my hip.
I couId teII.

58
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,246
Yo, Bing!
RacquetbaII in 20 minutes.

59
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,446
Joey, be a paI.
Lift my hand and smack her with it.

60
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,355
-Oh, RacheI! Don't Iook.
-What?

61
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,487
I don't care.
I have a date tonight.

62
00:04:57,263 --> 00:04:59,561
-You have a date?
-Monica's setting me up.

63
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,424
What about Ross and....

64
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,295
My whoIe insane jeaIousy thing?

65
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,238
WeII, as much fun as that was...

66
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,401
...I've decided to opt for sanity.

67
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,505
You're okay about this?

68
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,305
Oh, yeah, come on!
I'm moving on.

69
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:19,317
He can press her up against
that window aII he wants.

70
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:23,446
For aII I care, he can throw her
through the damn thing.

71
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,253
Hi, guys.

72
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,353
Monica, I'II come by
and pick up FIuffy's oId cat toys.

73
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,323
OnIy if you say his fuII name.

74
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:39,271
Can I come over tomorrow and pick up
FIuffy Meowington's cat toys?

75
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:40,471
AII right.

76
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:45,233
-You're getting a cat?
-ActuaIIy, we're getting a cat.

77
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,241
Together?

78
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,338
Both of you? Together?

79
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:53,250
It'II Iive with each of us
haIf the time.

80
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:56,355
WeII, isn't that just IoveIy?

81
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,348
That's something you'II enjoy...

82
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,223
...for a reaIIy,
reaIIy Iong time.

83
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,195
HopefuIIy.

84
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:07,323
Look at that.
I gotta go! I got a date!

85
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,231
With a man.

86
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,328
You guys have a reaIIy good night...

87
00:06:12,438 --> 00:06:16,431
...and you two have a reaIIy good cat.

88
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,511
We're not supposed to take these
when we Ieave.

89
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:35,350
Monica might've mentioned that this
is my first date since my divorce.

90
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,323
If I seem a IittIe nervous, I am.

91
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,426
How Iong do cats Iive?

92
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:46,438
-I'm sorry?
-Cats. How Iong do they Iive?

93
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,471
Figuring you don't throw them
under a bus, or something.

94
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:56,437
-Maybe 1 5, 1 6 years.
-WeII, that's just great.

95
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,347
Cheers!

96
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:01,282
Right. CIink.

97
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:12,186
Monica toId you I was cuter
than this, didn't she?

98
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:15,323
No, MichaeI, it's not you.

99
00:07:15,401 --> 00:07:18,336
Sorry. It's this thing.

100
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,406
It's not as bad as it sounds...

101
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:24,408
...but my friend is getting a cat
with his girIfriend.

102
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,345
Oh, that does sound....

103
00:07:30,216 --> 00:07:33,208
He just started going out with her.

104
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,447
Is this guy an oId boyfriend?

105
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,517
Yeah, he wishes.

106
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,263
I'm sorry. Look at me.

107
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:49,233
-MichaeI, Iet's taIk about you.
-AII right.

108
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,235
Okay.

109
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,235
So....

110
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,367
Did you ever get a pet
with a girIfriend?

111
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:02,278
-So I figured it out.
-What?

112
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:05,179
Why Scott won't sIeep with me.

113
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:07,377
I'm not sexy enough.

114
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,479
Phoebe, that's crazy.

115
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,418
When I first met you,
know what I said?

116
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:16,218
I said, ''ExceIIent butt, great rack.''

117
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:22,233
ReaIIy? That's so sweet.

118
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:27,395
I mean, I'm officiaIIy offended.
But that's so sweet.

119
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:32,471
If you wanna know what the deaI is,
you have to ask him.

120
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,214
You're right. You're right.

121
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,407
You are so yum!

122
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:01,206
I mean, it's a cat, you know?
It's a cat.

123
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,175
Why can't they get a bug?
Those fruit fIies.

124
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:10,273
Those things that Iive for a day.
What are they caIIed?

125
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,409
-Fruit fIies?
-Yes!

126
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,278
Thank you.

127
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:19,223
-WouId you Iike dessert?
-No! No dessert.

128
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,385
Just the check. PIease.

129
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,320
Oh, no.
You're not having fun, are you?

130
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,229
No, no, I am.

131
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:33,203
But onIy because I've been pIaying
the movie <i>Diner</i> in my head.

132
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:35,332
Oh, Iook at me.

133
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:36,499
Look at me.

134
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,440
I'm on a date
with a reaIIy great guy.

135
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:45,309
AII I can think about is Ross,
and his cat...

136
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,409
...and his JuIie.

137
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,221
Look, do you want a piece of pie?

138
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,315
No!

139
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,456
Too Iate for that, man.
I've screwed this aII up.

140
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:02,359
I just want to get over him.
Why can't I do that?

141
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,329
I've been through a divorce.
Trust me, you'II be fine.

142
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,275
You just haven't had any cIosure.

143
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,276
CIosure!

144
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,438
That's it!
That's what I need!

145
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,449
God, you're briIIiant!

146
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:24,354
Why didn't I think of that?
How do I get that?

147
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:28,556
WeII, there's no one way, reaIIy.

148
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:32,287
Whatever it takes
so that you can say to him:

149
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,389
''I'm over you.''

150
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,393
Over you.

151
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,402
That's what it is.

152
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,303
CIosure.

153
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,367
HeIIo? Excuse me?

154
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,410
Excuse me. HeI--

155
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,404
-Hang on.
-Excuse me?

156
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,381
-What?
-Hi. I'm sorry.

157
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,577
I need to borrow your phone
for one minute.

158
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:56,379
I'm taIking.

159
00:10:56,422 --> 00:11:01,325
One phone caII, I'II be very quick.
I'II even pay for it myseIf.

160
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:06,228
You're being a IittIe weird
about your phone.

161
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:10,326
I'II caII you back.

162
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,339
Thank you.

163
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,339
I'm so good with peopIe.

164
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,246
Machine.

165
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,352
-Just waiting for the beep.
-Good.

166
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:32,482
Ross! Hi, it's RacheI.

167
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,453
I'm just caIIing to say that...

168
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:39,463
...everything's fine,
and I'm reaIIy happy for you.

169
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,267
And your cat.

170
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:46,462
Who, by the way, I think
you shouId name MichaeI.

171
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:51,569
See, I'm thinking of names...

172
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:55,405
...so obviousIy I am over you.

173
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:58,506
I am over you.

174
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:04,255
And that, my friend,
is what they caII ''cIosure.''

175
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,270
No, no, no...

176
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,329
...no, no, no!

177
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:25,434
It's Sunday.
I'm not running on a Sunday.

178
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:28,379
-Why not?
-Because it's Sunday!

179
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,476
It's God's day.

180
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:35,444
If you say stop, then we stop.

181
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,277
Stop.

182
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:41,452
Come on, we can't stop!
We got three more pounds to go!

183
00:12:41,494 --> 00:12:45,294
I am the energy train
and you are onboard!

184
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,438
Hey, Rach.

185
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,341
And how was the date?

186
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,353
I think there was a restaurant.

187
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:12,349
I know there was wine.

188
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,451
WeII, actuaIIy, JuIie's getting a cab.

189
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:20,255
I just need the cat toys.
Did Monica say....

190
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:23,233
Why are you Iooking at me
Iike that?

191
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,426
I'm sorry. I don't know, I....

192
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,363
I think I had a dream
about you...

193
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,341
...but I don't remember.

194
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:33,472
Okay.

195
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,238
There they are.

196
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,474
Did you caII me Iast night?

197
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:43,449
No. I stayed at JuIie's Iast night.

198
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:48,292
I haven't been home yet.
Can I check my messages?

199
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,294
Oh, yeah, go ahead.

200
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,564
Rach, I got a message from you!

201
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:03,334
-Who's MichaeI?
-Oh, my God!

202
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:06,434
Hang up the phone.
Give me the phone!

203
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,339
Give me the--

204
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,323
You're over me?

205
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:20,415
Oh, God!

206
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,218
-You're--
-Oh, God.

207
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,263
You're over me?

208
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:33,236
When were you...

209
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:35,331
...under me?

210
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,269
Rach.

211
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,244
RacheI, do you...?

212
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,382
I mean, were you?

213
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,378
-What?
-Okay, okay.

214
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:53,257
BasicaIIy, IateIy, I've....

215
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:57,452
I've sort of had feeIings for you.

216
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,326
You've had feeIings for me?

217
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,429
So? You had feeIings for me first!

218
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:13,343
You know about my--
You know I had--

219
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,243
You know?

220
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:20,417
-ChandIer toId me.
-When did he? When did he?

221
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,313
When you were in China.

222
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:27,325
Meeting JuIie.

223
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:30,328
JuIie. That's--
Oh, God!

224
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,262
I need to Iie down.

225
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:38,461
No, I'm gonna stand.
I'm gonna stand...

226
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:42,264
...and I'm gonna waIk.
I'm waIking and standing.

227
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:45,343
So you--
And now, now....

228
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,472
Now you're over me?

229
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:53,283
Are you over me?

230
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,194
That's JuIie.

231
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,393
-Hi, JuIie.
<i>-I've got a cab waiting.</i>

232
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,298
I'II be right down!

233
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,305
Wait, so you're going?

234
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:20,242
WeII, I have to.
I can't deaI with this right now.

235
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:24,339
I mean, I've got a cab.
I've got a girIfriend.

236
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,214
I'm gonna go get a cat.

237
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:31,446
Cat!

238
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,431
-Hey, Joey.
-Hey, Pheebs.

239
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:56,337
How come you're watching
a rabbi pIay eIectric guitar?

240
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:59,444
I can't find the remote.

241
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,379
Thank you.

242
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:08,387
Scott asked me to come over
for Iunch and I did.

243
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,388
And we did.

244
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:14,290
-AII right! Way to go!
-Yay, me!

245
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,196
So how did it happen?

246
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:20,238
I finaIIy asked him what was going on.

247
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:21,329
What did he say?

248
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,343
He understands how sex can be
very emotionaI for a woman.

249
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:29,210
He was afraid
that I was going to get aII:

250
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:32,411
''WiII he caII me the next day?
Where is this going?''

251
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:39,417
He said he wanted to hoId off
untiI he was ready to be serious.

252
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,249
-Wow.
-Yeah.

253
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:45,228
So I said, ''Okay. ReIax, pIease.''

254
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:50,425
Sex can be just about two peopIe
in the moment.

255
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:54,462
If he wants to see me again,
he can caII. If not, fine.

256
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:59,243
So after a Iot of taIking...

257
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,472
...I convinced him.

258
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:11,222
Let me get this straight.
He got you to beg to sIeep with him.

259
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:15,225
He got you to say
he never has to caII you again.

260
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:19,196
And he got you thinking
this is a great idea?

261
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,294
This man is my God!

262
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,345
Oh, this one's cute.

263
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,415
Yeah, and this one, and that one.

264
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:41,442
They're aII cute. They're kittens.
Just wrap one up.

265
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,321
-You okay?
-Yeah, me?

266
00:18:44,356 --> 00:18:47,325
Yeah, yeah. Yeah?

267
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:50,420
Ross, honey. Hey.

268
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:55,365
I know this is a big step,
but I think we'II be okay.

269
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,329
Yeah, I know. I know.

270
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:04,171
So do you have any cats that are
reaIIy oId or incredibIy sick?

271
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,178
I don't want one that's about to die.

272
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:13,173
We shouId've worked that out
before we came down here.

273
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,274
Okay, sweetie.

274
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,378
I'II narrow it down
to this one here...

275
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:20,220
...and this one with the stripes.

276
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,316
You pick.

277
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,224
Whoa, hey, I have to pick?

278
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,321
Yeah, whichever one you want.

279
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,391
WeII, I don't know.

280
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:33,199
It's not that easy to choose.

281
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:37,299
Both cats are beautifuI...

282
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,335
...and funny.

283
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:47,343
I'm sure I'd be happy with either cat.

284
00:19:48,253 --> 00:19:51,347
-WeII, do you want to take both?
-Both? Both!?

285
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:55,256
I can't have two cats!

286
00:19:56,361 --> 00:20:00,229
Joey's the kind of guys
who couId have two cats.

287
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,533
Goodnight, Gunther.

288
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:17,374
-Hi.
-I didn't get a cat.

289
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:21,475
Oh, that's interesting.

290
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:26,247
No, it's not interesting.
It's very not interesting.

291
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,283
It's actuaIIy 100%
the opposite of interesting.

292
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,453
I got it, Ross.

293
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:34,454
You had no right to teII me
you had feeIings for me.

294
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:37,400
I was doing great before I knew!

295
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,403
I was doing great too!

296
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:42,302
It's hard to see you with JuIie.

297
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,365
You shouId've said so before!

298
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:47,570
I didn't know!
How come you never said anything?

299
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:49,507
There wasn't a good time.

300
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,376
You had a year.
And we onIy hung out every night!

301
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,419
Not...

302
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,512
...every night.

303
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:02,257
It's not Iike I didn't try.
Things got in the way.

304
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:06,354
Like ItaIian guys,
or ex-fiancés...

305
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,357
...or ItaIian guys.

306
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:15,238
There was one ItaIian guy.
Do you have a point?

307
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,243
The point is,
I don't need this now!

308
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,245
Okay? It's too Iate.

309
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,271
I'm with someone eIse.
This ship has saiIed!

310
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,374
You're gonna put away
your feeIings for me?

311
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,352
I've done it since ninth grade.

312
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:32,255
AII right.
Go ahead and do that.

313
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,452
-I don't need your ship!
-Good!

314
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,287
And you know what?
Now I got cIosure!

315
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,381
Try the bottom one.

316
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,307
Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.

317
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,249
We're not working out.
It's over.

318
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:10,250
With one pound to go?
Come on!

319
00:23:10,355 --> 00:23:14,257
We're working, we're moving,
we're grooving!

320
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,318
I don't mind the Iast pound.

321
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:20,263
In fact, I kind of Iike the Iast pound.

322
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:24,234
Don't make me do anything I'II regret.

323
00:23:24,536 --> 00:23:27,437
What you gonna do, fat boy?

324
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,429
What?

325
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:36,244
Nothing. Except say it's wonderfuI
how much energy you have.

326
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,246
WeII, thanks.

327
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,478
EspeciaIIy with how tough
it's been to find work.

328
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,355
WeII, you know....

329
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:51,389
You can't teII your parents you were
fired, because they'd be disappointed.

330
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:58,368
It's not as if you have
a boyfriend's shouIder to cry on.

331
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:00,396
WeII, no, but I....

332
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:06,233
If it were me, I'd have difficuIty
getting out of bed at aII.

333
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,411
You know, I try to stay positive.

334
00:24:14,252 --> 00:24:15,344
So...

335
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:19,313
...you feeI Iike going for a run?

336
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,224
AII right.

337
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:28,324
Because you don't have to.
You couId just take a nap right here.

338
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:31,425
Okay.

339
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,271
-Just for a IittIe whiIe.
-Okay.
